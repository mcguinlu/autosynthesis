"Novel meta-analysis pipeline of heterogeneous high-throughput gene expression datasets reveals dysregulated interactions and pathways in asthma","Introduction Asthma is a complex and chronic inflammatory disorder with varying degrees of airway inflammation It affects 235 million people worldwide and about 8 of the United States population Unlike single-gene disorders asthma phenotypes are guided by a highly variable combination of genotypes making it a complex disease to study computationally Recently several independent high-throughput gene expression studies in bioinformatics have identified and proposed numerous molecular drivers involved in asthma initiation and progression However there is a poor consensus in our understanding of the molecular factors involved in the mechanism of this disease due to inherent genetic heterogeneity Such an uncertainty in bioinformatics studies have led to a reproducibility crisis in the field where similar analyses can often yield greatly varying results In this study we seek to harness heterogeneity in asthma by applying a meta-analysis that explores varying tissue environmentsMethods We use three publicly-available microarray gene expression datasets belonging to different tissues in asthma patients from NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus GEO As a meta-analysis we apply a mixed-model effect size test to determine differentially expressed DE genes across all three studies Then The datasets are pre-processed and subjected to Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis WGCNA for identification of functional modules Using module preservation we determine modules in asthma that were not preserved in the healthy condition then combine the three with a Fishers test for a set of asthma-unique modules These modules are explored using functional analysis ie GO term analysis Using the DE genes as well as known transcription factors we re-construct Gene Regulatory Networks GRNs for each of our shortlisted modules We then studied the topology of these GRNs using hive plots to reveal underlying dysregulations paving the way for future analyses  Results Our analysis reveals a novel perspective to a key interaction in asthma inflammatory regulation the CHD4-CCL26 transcription relation Our hive plot analysis is able to explore this gene interaction beyond the typical over-expression under-expression results from typical bioinformatics studies We reveal that CCL26 an important regulator of asthma appears to increase in expression and topological degree in asthma but loses connection to CHD4 which seems to be characteristic to the asthma disease Such analysis suggests that the topology of gene networks above simply expression values may be key to understanding the nuanced interactions between fundamental biomarkers and drug targets in complex diseases like asthma","/content/10.1101/19012377v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012377v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Allergy and Immunology\\\\\\\\n","Guo","/highwire/citation/70246/bibtext",1,"211119-1","21/11/2019","70246"
"Appraisal of the pleiotropic effects of intelligence and education on schizophrenia a univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization study","Education and intelligence are highly correlated and inversely associated with schizophrenia Counterintuitively education genetically associates with an increased risk for the disease To investigate why this study applies a multivariable Mendelian randomization of intelligence and education For those without college degrees older age of finishing school associates with a decreased likelihood of schizophrenia independent of intelligence and hence may be entangled with the health inequalities reflecting differences in education A different picture is observed for schooling years inclusive of college more years of schooling increases the likelihood of schizophrenia whereas higher intelligence distinctly and independently decreases it This implies the pleiotropy between years of schooling and schizophrenia is horizontal and likely confounded by a third trait influencing education A multivariable Mendelian randomization of schooling years and bipolar disorder reveals that the increased risk of schizophrenia conferred by more schooling years is an artefact of bipolar disorder not education","/content/10.1101/19012401v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012401v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Genetic and Genomic Medicine\\\\\\\\n","Adams","/highwire/citation/70245/bibtext",2,"211119-2","21/11/2019","70245"
"Limited Capacity for Ipsilateral Secondary Motor Areas to Support Hand Function Post-Stroke","Recent findings have shown connections of ipsilateral cortico-reticulospinal tract CRST predominantly originating from secondary motor areas to not only proximal but also distal portions of the arm In unilateral stroke CRST from the ipsilateral side is intact and thus has been proposed as a possible backup system for post-stroke rehabilitation even for the hand We argue that although CRST from ipsilateral secondary motor areas can provide control for proximal joints it is insufficient to control either hand or coordinated shoulder and hand movements due to its extensive branching compared to contralateral corticospinal tract To address this issue we combined MRI high-density EEG and robotics in 17 individuals with severe chronic hemiparetic stroke and 12 age-matched controls We tested for changes in structural morphometry of the sensorimotor cortex and found that individuals with stroke demonstrated higher gray matter density in secondary motor areas ipsilateral to the paretic arm compared to controls We then measured cortical activity while participants attempted to generate hand opening either supported on a table or while lifting against a shoulder abduction load The addition of shoulder abduction during hand opening increased reliance on ipsilateral secondary motor areas in stroke but not controls Crucially increased use of ipsilateral secondary motor areas was associated with decreased hand opening ability while lifting the arm due to involuntary coupling between the shoulder and wrist/finger flexors Together this evidence implicates a compensatory role for ipsilateral ie contralesional secondary motor areas post-stroke but with limited capacity to support hand function","/content/10.1101/19012336v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012336v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy\\\\\\\\n","Wilkins","/highwire/citation/70242/bibtext",3,"211119-3","21/11/2019","70242"
"Step-downs reduce workers compensation payments to encourage return to work Are they effective?","ObjectiveTo determine whether step-downs which cut the rate of compensation paid to injured workers after they have been on benefits for several months incentivise return to workMethodsWe aggregated administrative claims data from nine Australian workers compensation systems to calculate weekly scheme exit rates a proxy for return to work Jurisdictions were further subdivided into four condition subgroups fractures musculoskeletal mental health and other trauma The effect of step-downs on scheme exit was tested using a regression discontinuity design Results were pooled into meta-analyses to calculate combined effects and the proportion of variance attributable to heterogeneityResultsThe combined effect of step-downs was a 061 percentage point 95 CI -116 to -005 reduction in the exit rate with significant heterogeneity between jurisdictions I2  73 p  001 Most significant effects were observed within earliest step-downs implemented at 13 weeks of benefit payment Within condition subgroups only fractures had a significant combined effect -084 95 CI -161 to -007 and sensitivity analysis suggested a potentially meaningful effect among mental health claims as wellConclusionsThe results suggest step-downs prompt an anticipatory effect meaning some claimants leave compensation ahead of the step-down to avoid the reduction in benefits However the effects were small and given their anticipatory nature probably short-lived Our findings were statistically significant but questions remain about practical significance We find limited evidence that step-downs are an effective incentive for return to work","/content/10.1101/19012286v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012286v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Occupational and Environmental Health\\\\\\\\n","Lane","/highwire/citation/70239/bibtext",4,"211119-4","21/11/2019","70239"

"Identification of non-small cell lung cancer subgroups with distinct immuno-therapy outcomes from integrating genomics and electronic health records on a graph convolutional network","Recently immuno-oncology IO therapies especially checkpoint inhibitor therapies have transformed the therapeutic landscape of non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC However responses to IO in NSCLC are highly disparate because patients are heterogenous with a variety of genomic and clinical-phenotype complexity Thus there is a pressing need to discover and characterize NSCLC subgroups to advance precision immuno-oncology However this is a challenging task largely due to 1 the study cohort is too small to investigate this heterogeneous disease 2 the datasets used in subtyping studies are not comprehensive enough to incorporate both genomic data and diverse clinical-phenotype data with long-term follow-ups and 3 the subtyping algorithms and models are ineffective in integrating high-dimensional data from both genomic and clinical domains To address these challenges we have developed a graph convolutional neural network GCN method to discover NSCLC complexity on IO treatment responses based on the high-dimensional electronic health records EHR and genomic data from 1937 IO treated NSCLC patients First using Flatiron Health database we identified a IO treated NSCLC cohort n  1937 with genomic data from Foundation-Medicine targeted DNA deep-sequencing clinical data from harmonized real-world EHR from 275 US oncology practices and survival data after IO treatment with a median follow-up time of 661 months average follow-up time 911 months We then developed a GCN based artificial intelligence AI model to build a patient-patient similarity network from integrating both genomic and EHR data to discover novel NSCLC subgroups with dramatically different responses to IO therapies We have demonstrated the performance of the GCN is superior to commonly used machine learning methods such as autoencoder UMAP and tSNE and superior to utilizing genomic or clinical data alone Importantly we have successfully discovered the IO responsive covers 2027 of the cohort and the IO non-responsive 4546 subgroups that demonstrate significant overall survival difference after IO treatments 942 vs 2035 months p00001 These two subgroups demonstrate enrichments of novel clinical phenotypes and genomic traits beyond well-known IO biomarkers of tumor mutation burden and PDL1 status such as enrichment of abnormal blood Basophils and KRAS mutations in the responsive subgroup and the enrichment of low hemoglobin low lymphocytes PI3KCA amplifications etc in the non-responsive subgroup suggesting distinct clinical and molecular underpinnings To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to employ a graph-based AI approach to integrate both high-dimensional clinical and genomic features to investigate IO treatment responses in NSCLC The new subtypes discovered in this work cast new lights on understanding the heterogeneity of IO treatment responses and pave ways to inform clinical decision making for precision oncology of NSCLCKeywords artificial intelligence graph convolutional neural network machine learning immuno-oncology precision oncology non-small cell lung cancer disease subtyping","/content/10.1101/19011437v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011437v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Health Informatics\\\\\\\\n","Fang","/highwire/citation/70103/bibtext",61,"211119-61","21/11/2019","70103"

"The impact of reactive mass vaccination campaigns on measles outbreaks in the Katanga region Democratic Republic of Congo","The Katanga region in the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC has been struck by repeated epidemics of measles In many of the affected health zones reactive mass vaccination campaigns were conducted in response to the outbreaks Here we attempted to determine how effective campaigns were in curtailing a large outbreak in 2015 Using a model of measles transmission we compared observed case numbers to a counterfactual of no campaigns by first fitting a model to the data including the campaigns and then re-running this without vaccination Focusing on eight of the 68 health zones in the Katanga region we estimated the reactive campaigns to have reduced the size of the outbreaks by approximately 21000 IQR 16000--27000 95 CI 8300--38000 or 21 IQR 17--25 95 CI 93--34 of possible measles cases There was considerable heterogeneity in the impact of campaigns with campaigns startgin earlier after the start of an outbreak being more impactful We further sought to establish whether the spatial pattern of the outbreak could have been determined in advance to help prioritise areas for vaccination campaigns and speed up the response The best predictors of outbreak size among all the health zones were vaccination coverage derived from cluster surveys and outbreak size in 2010-13 This combined with the fact that the vast majority of reported cases were in under-5 year olds would suggest that there are systematic issues of undervaccination If this was to continue outbreaks would be expected to continue to occur in the affected health zones at regular intervals mostly concentrated in under-5 year olds Taken together our findings suggest that while a strong routine vaccination regime remains the most effective means of measles control it might be possible to improve the effectiveness of reactive campaigns by considering predictive factors to trigger a more targeted vaccination response","/content/10.1101/19003434v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003434v3.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Epidemiology\\\\\\\\n","Funk","/highwire/citation/69464/bibtext",260,"211119-260","21/11/2019","69464"

"Childhood immune imprinting to influenza A shapes birth year-specific risk during seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 epidemics","Across decades of co-circulation in humans influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have caused seasonal epidemics characterized by different age distributions of cases and mortality H3N2 causes the majority of relatively severe clinically attended cases in high-risk elderly cohorts and the majority of overall deaths whereas H1N1 causes fewer deaths overall and cases shifted towards young and middle-aged adults These contrasting age profiles may result from differences in childhood exposure to H1N1 and H3N2 or from differences in evolutionary rate between subtypes Here we analyze a large epidemiological surveillance dataset to test whether childhood immune imprinting shapes seasonal influenza epidemiology and if so whether it acts primarily via immune memory of a particular influenza subtype or via broader immune memory that protects across subtypes We also test the impact of evolutionary differences between influenza subtypes on age distributions of cases Likelihood-based model comparison shows that narrow within-subtype imprinting shapes seasonal influenza risk alongside age-specific risk factors The data do not support a strong effect of evolutionary rate or of broadly protective imprinting that acts across subtypes Our findings emphasize that childhood exposures can imprint a lifelong immunological bias toward particular influenza subtypes and that these cohort-specific biases shape epidemic age distributions As a result newer and less senior antibody responses acquired later in life do not provide the same strength of protection as responses imprinted in childhood  Finally we project that the relatively low mortality burden of H1N1 may increase in the coming decades as cohorts that lack H1N1-specific imprinting eventually reach old age","/content/10.1101/19001834v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001834v2.full.pdf","2019-09-26","Epidemiology\\\\\\\\n","Gostic","/highwire/citation/69242/bibtext",337,"211119-337","21/11/2019","69242"
"Hidden heterogeneity and its influence on dengue vaccination impact","The CYD-TDV vaccine was recently developed to combat dengue a mosquito-borne viral disease that afflicts millions of people each year throughout the tropical and subtropical world Its rollout has been complicated by recent findings that vaccinees with no prior exposure to dengue virus DENV experience an elevated risk of severe disease in response to their first DENV infection subsequent to vaccination As a result of these findings guidelines for use of CYD-TDV now require serological screening prior to vaccination to establish that an individual does not fall into this high-risk category These complications mean that the public health impact of CYD-TDV vaccination is expected to be higher in areas with higher transmission One important practical difficulty with tailoring vaccination policy to local transmission contexts is that DENV transmission is spatially heterogeneous even at the scale of neighborhoods or blocks within a city This raises the question of whether models based on data that average over spatial heterogeneity in transmission could fail to capture important aspects of CYD-TDV impact in spatially heterogeneous populations We explored this question with a deterministic model of DENV transmission and CYD-TDV vaccination in a population comprised of two communities with differing transmission intensities Compared to the full model a version of the model based on the average of the two communities failed to capture benefits of targeting the intervention to the high-transmission community which resulted in greater impact in both communities than we observed under even coverage In addition the model based on the average of the two communities substantially overestimated impact among vaccinated individuals in the low-transmission community In the event that the specificity of serological screening is not high this result suggests that models that ignore spatial heterogeneity could overlook the potential for harm to this segment of the population","/content/10.1101/19006783v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006783v2.full.pdf","2019-09-26","Epidemiology\\\\\\\\n","Walters","/highwire/citation/69241/bibtext",338,"211119-338","21/11/2019","69241"

"Self-blaming emotions in major depression a randomised pilot trial comparing fMRI neurofeedback training with self-guided psychological strategies NeuroMooD","Background Overgeneralised self-blame and worthlessness are key symptoms of major depressive disorder MDD and were previously associated with self-blame-selective changes in connectivity between right superior anterior temporal lobe rSATL and subgenual frontal areas In a previous study remitted MDD patients successfully modulated guilt-selective rSATL-subgenual cingulate connectivity using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging rtfMRI neurofeedback training thereby increasing their self-esteem The feasibility and potential of using this approach in symptomatic MDD were unknown Methods This single-blind pre-registered randomised controlled pilot trial tested the clinical potential of a novel self-guided psychological intervention with and without additional rSATL-posterior subgenual cortex SC rtfMRI neurofeedback targeting self-blaming emotions in insufficiently recovered people with MDD and early treatment-resistance n43 n35 completers Following a diagnostic baseline assessment patients completed three self-guided sessions to rebalance self-blaming biases and a post-treatment assessment The fMRI neurofeedback software FRIEND was used to measure rSATL-posterior SC connectivity while the BDI-II was administered to assess depressive symptom severity as a primary outcome measure Results Both interventions were demonstrated to be safe and beneficial resulting in a mean reduction of MDD symptom severity by 46 and response rates of more than 55 with no group difference Secondary analyses however revealed a differential response on our primary outcome measure between MDD patients with and without DSM-5 defined anxious distress Stratifying by anxious distress features was investigated because this was found to be the most common subtype in our sample MDD patients without anxious distress showed a higher response to rtfMRI neurofeedback training compared to the psychological intervention with the opposite pattern found in anxious MDD We explored potentially confounding clinical differences between subgroups and found that anxious MDD patients were much more likely to experience anger towards others as measured on our psychopathological interview which might play a role in their poorer response to neurofeedback In keeping with the hypothesis that self-worth plays a key role in MDD improvement on our primary outcome measure was correlated with increases in self-esteem after the intervention and this correlated with the frequency with which participants employed the strategies to tackle self-blame outside of the treatment sessionsConclusions These findings suggest that self-blame-selective rtfMRI neurofeedback training may be superior over a solely psychological intervention in non-anxious MDD although further confirmatory studies are needed The self-guided psychological intervention showed a surprisingly high clinical potential in the anxious MDD group which needs further confirmation compared vs treatment-as-usual Future studies need to investigate whether self-blame-selective rSATL-SC connectivity changes are irrelevant in anxious MDD which could explain their response being better to the psychological intervention without interfering neurofeedback","/content/10.1101/19004309v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004309v1.full.pdf","2019-08-09","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology\\\\\\\\n","Jaeckle","/highwire/citation/68641/bibtext",522,"211119-522","21/11/2019","68641"

"Investigating the attitudes of Canadian paramedic students towards homelessness","Introduction When paramedics are dispatched it is expected that every patient receives the same level of care regardless of variable factors Homelessness is a growing social issue across Canada that is particularly prevalent in urban areas The quality of healthcare delivered to individuals experiencing homelessness may be influenced by negative attitudes held by healthcare professionals There is an absence of literature quantifying the perspectives of paramedics towards homelessness therefore the focus of this study was to identify the attitudes of paramedic students towards homelessness and to continue the conversation in regards to the evolving educational needs of paramedic studentsMethods This study employed a longitudinal design of a convenience sample of first year paramedic students in a college program in Ontario Canada The Health Professionals Attitude Towards the Homeless Inventory HPATHI was distributed to participants before and after placement and clinical exposure The questionnaire includes 19 statements which participants respond to on a Likert scale Mean scores were calculated and statements were categorized into attitudes interest and confidence Data were collected post-placement on interactions with persons experiencing homelessnessResults A total of 52 first year paramedic students completed the HPATHI pre-placement and 47 completed the questionnaire post-placement Mean scores for attitudes pre 364 SD 049 post 385 SD 038 p0032 interest pre 391 SD 040 post 384 SD 039p051 and confidence pre 402 SD 050 post 371 SD 067 p0004 were largely positive but there was a demonstrated decreasing trend in confidence with and interest in working with those experiencing homelessness Participants reported an average of 60 hours of placement during which 15 participants 32 reported interactions with people experiencing homelessnessConclusion First year paramedic students demonstrate overall positive attitudes towards those experiencing homelessness and the mean score for attitudes improved over the surveys However there were demonstrable decreases in confidence and interest over time which may be related to the type and frequency of interactions during clinical placement Paramedic education programs may benefit from the inclusion of focused education on homelessness specific clinical experiences and education related to social determinants of health","/content/10.1101/19003483v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003483v1.full.pdf","2019-08-06","Public and Global Health\\\\\\\\n","Cochrane","/highwire/citation/68636/bibtext",525,"211119-525","21/11/2019","68636"

"Considerations in the deployment of novel universal vaccines against epidemic and pandemic influenza","There is increasing interest in the development of new universal influenza vaccines UIV that - unlike current vaccines - are effective against a broad range of seasonal influenza strains as well as against novel pandemic viruses Even where these vaccines do not block infection they can moderate clinical severity reducing morbidity and mortality while potentially also reducing opportunities for transmission Previous modelling studies have illustrated the potential epidemiological benefits of UIVs including their potential to mitigate pandemic burden However these new vaccines could shape population immunity in complex ways Here using mathematical models of influenza transmission we illustrate two types of unintended consequences that could arise from their future deployment First by reducing the amount of infection-induced immunity in a population without fully replacing it a seasonal UIV programme may permit larger pandemics than in the absence of vaccination Second the more successful a future UIV programme is in reducing transmission of seasonal influenza the more vulnerable the population could become to the emergence of a vaccine-escape variant These risks could be mitigated by optimal deployment of any future UIV vaccine namely the use of a combined vaccine formulation incorporating conventional as well as multiple universal antigenic targets and by achieving sufficient population coverage to compensate for reductions in infection-induced immunity As early candidates of UIVs approach advanced clinical trials there is a need to monitor their characteristics in such a way that is focused on their potential impact This work offers a first step in this direction","/content/10.1101/19002485v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002485v1.full.pdf","2019-07-29","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)\\\\\\\\n","Arinaminpathy","/highwire/citation/68543/bibtext",552,"211119-552","21/11/2019","68543"

"Macro-parasite transmission in dynamic seasonal environment Basic Reproductive Number endemicity and control","Seasonality of transmission environment which includes snail populations and habitats or human-snail contact patterns can affect the dynamics of schistosomiasis infection and control outcomes Conventional modeling approaches often ignore or oversimplify it by applying seasonal mean formulation Mathematically such averaging is justified when model outputs/quantities of interest depend linearly on input variables That is not generally the case for macroparasite transmission models where model outputs are nonlinear functions of seasonality fashion Another commonly used approach for Schistosomiasis modeling is a reduction of coupled human-snail system to a single human equation via quasi-stationary snail intermediate host dynamics The basic questions arising from these approaches are whether such seasonal averaging and intermediate host reduction are suitable for highly variable/seasonal environments and what implications these methods have on models predictive potential of control interventionsHere we address these questions by using a combination of mathematical analysis and numerical simulation of two commonly used models for macroparasite transmission MacDonald MWB and stratified worm burden SWB snail-human systems We showed that predictions from seasonal averaging models can depart significantly from those of quasi-stationary models Typically seasonality would lower endemicity and sustained infection vs stationary system with comparable transmission inputs Furthermore discrepancies between the two models seasonal and its stationary mean increase with amplitude or variance of seasonality So sufficiently high variability can render infection unsustainable Similar discrepancies were observed between coupled and reduced single host models with reduced model overpredicting sustained endemicity Seasonal variability of transmission raises the question of optimal control timing Using dynamic simulation we show that optimal timing of repeated MDA is about half season past the snail peak where snail population attains its minimal value Compared to sub-optimal timing such strategy can reduce human worm burden by factor 2 after 5-6 rounds of MDA We also extended our models for dynamic snail populations which allowed us to study the effect of repeated molluscicide or combined strategy MDA  molluscicide The optimal time for molluscicide alone is the end or the start of season and combined strategy can give additional reduction and in some cases lead to eliminationOverall reduced sustainability in seasonal environment makes it more amenable to control interventions compared to stationary environment","/content/10.1101/19012245v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012245v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)\\\\\\\\n","Huang","/highwire/citation/70267/bibtext",17,"221119-17","22/11/2019","70267"

"Self-selected step length asymmetry is not explained by energy cost minimization in individuals with chronic stroke","Background Asymmetric gait post-stroke is associated with decreased mobility yet individuals with chronic stroke often self-select an asymmetric gait despite being capable of walking more symmetrically The purpose of this study was to test whether self-selected asymmetry could be explained by energy cost minimization We hypothesized that short-term deviations from self-selected asymmetry would result in increased metabolic energy consumption despite being associated with long-term rehabilitation benefits Other studies have found no difference in metabolic rate across different levels of enforced asymmetry among individuals with chronic stroke but used methods that left some uncertainty to be resolved Methods In this study ten individuals with chronic stroke walked on a treadmill at participant-specific speeds while voluntarily modulating step length asymmetry We included only participants with significant self-selected asymmetry who were able to significantly alter asymmetry using visual biofeedback Conditions included targeting zero asymmetry self-selected asymmetry and double the self-selected asymmetry Participants were trained with the biofeedback system in one session and data were collected in three subsequent sessions with repeated measures Self-selected asymmetry was consistent across sessions A similar protocol was conducted among unimpaired participantsResults Participants with chronic stroke substantially altered step length asymmetry using biofeedback but this did not affect metabolic rate ANOVA p  08 In unimpaired participants self-selected step length asymmetry was close to zero and corresponded to the lowest energy cost ANOVA p  6e-4 While the symmetry of unimpaired gait may be the result of energy cost minimization self-selected step length asymmetry in individuals with chronic stroke cannot be explained by a similar least-effort drive Conclusions Interventions that encourage changes in step length asymmetry by manipulating metabolic energy consumption may be effective because these therapies would not have to overcome a metabolic penalty for altering asymmetry","/content/10.1101/19013854v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013854v1.full.pdf","2019-12-06","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy\\\\\\\\n","Nguyen","/highwire/citation/70506/bibtext",5,"071219-5","07/12/2019","70506"

"Informing Pharmacokinetic Models with Physiological Data Oral Population Modeling of L-Serine in Humans","To determine how to set optimal oral L-serine serine dose levels for a clinical trial existing literature was surveyed Data sufficient to set the dose was inadequate and so a n10 Phase I-A calibration trial was performed administering serine with and without other oral agents  We analyzed the trial and the literature data using pharmacokinetic PK modeling and statistical analysis The therapeutic goal is to modulate specific serine-related metabolic pathways in the liver using the lowest possible dose which gives the desired effect since the upper bound was expected to be limited by toxicity In this paper we first review relevant literature describe the calibration trial and resulting data and present the results of modeling from the trial Serine is a non-essential amino acid that is nonetheless present at a base level in blood from both dietary sources and endogenous production Serine is consumed by several pathways A standard PK approach in which a common model structure was selected using a fit to data yielded a model with a single central compartment corresponding to plasma clearance from that compartment and an endogenous source of serine The lack of intravenous data normally prevents independent determination of bioavailability and volume of distribution however under some assumptions about endogenous synthesis and use values could be estimated The model was poorly conditioned but did give consistent estimates To improve conditioning a parametric structure was changed to estimate ratios bioavailability over volume for example Model fit quality was improved and the uncertainty in estimated parameters was reduced Because of the particular interest in the fate of serine the model was used to estimate whether serine is consumed in the gut absorbed by the liver or entered the blood in either a free state or in a protein- or tissue-bound state that is not measured by our assay The PK model structure was set up to represent relevant physiology and this quantitative systems biology approach allowed a broader set of physiological data to be used to narrow parameter and prediction confidence intervals and to better understand the biological meaning of the data The model results allowed us to determine the optimal human dose for future trials including a trial design component including IV and tracer studies A key contribution is that we were able to use human physiological data from the literature to inform the PK model and to set reasonable bounds on parameters and to improve model conditioning Leveraging literature data produced a more predictive useful model","/content/10.1101/2019.12.07.19011429v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.07.19011429v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Pharmacology and Therapeutics\\\\\\\\n","Bosley","/highwire/citation/70573/bibtext",23,"151219-23","15/12/2019","70573"
"Biological age in UK Biobank biomarker composition and prediction of mortality coronary heart disease and hospital admissions","Background Age is the strongest risk factor for most chronic diseases and yet individuals may age at different rates biologically A biological age formed from biomarkers may be a stronger risk factor than chronological age and understanding what factors contribute to it could provide insight into new opportunities for disease prevention Methods and findings Among 480019 UK Biobank participants aged 40-70 recruited in 2006-2010 and followed up for 6-12 years via linked death registry and secondary care records a subpopulation of 141254 294 non-smoking adults in good health and with no medication use or disease history at baseline were identified Independent components of 72 biomarkers measured at baseline were characterised by principal component analysis The Klemera Doubal method KDM which derived a weighted sum of biomarker principal components based on the strengths of their linear associations with chronological age was used to derive sex-specific biological ages in this healthy subpopulation The proportions of the overall biological and chronological age effects on mortality coronary heart disease and age-related non-fatal hospital admissions based on a hospital frailty index that were explained by biological age were assessed using log-likelihoods of proportional hazards models Reduced lung function reduced kidney function slower reaction time lower insulin-like-growth factor 1 lower hand grip strength and higher blood pressure were key contributors to biological age explaining the highest percentages of its variance in both men and women while lower albumin higher sex hormone-binding globulin and lower muscle mass in men and higher liver enzymes blood lipids and HbA1c in women were also important Across both sexes a 51-principal component biological age explained 66 80 and 63 of the age effects on mortality coronary heart disease and hospital admissions respectively Restricting the biological age to the 12-13 key biomarkers corresponding to the 10 most importantly contributing principal components resulted in little change in these proportions for women but a reduction to 53 63 and 50 respectively for men Conclusions This study identified that markers of impaired function in a range of organs account for a substantial proportion of the apparent effect of age on disease and hospital admissions It supports a broader multi-system approach to research and prevention of diseases of ageing","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014720v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014720v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Epidemiology\\\\\\\\n","Chan","/highwire/citation/70691/bibtext",1,"161219-1","16/12/2019","70691"

"Disease progression modeling in Alzheimers disease insights from the shape of cognitive decline","Background The characterizing symptom of Alzheimer disease AD is cognitive deterioration While much recent work has focused on defining AD as a biological construct most patients are still diagnosed staged and treated based on their cognitive symptoms But the cognitive capability of a patient at any time throughout this deterioration will not directly reflect the disease state but rather the effect of the cognitive decline on the patients predisease cognitive capability Patients with high predisease cognitive capabilities tend to score better on cognitive tests relative to patients with low predisease cognitive capabilities at the same disease stage Thus a single assessment with a cognitive test is not adequate for determining the stage of an AD patientMethods and Findings I developed a joint statistical model that explicitly modeled disease stage baseline cognition and the patients individual changes in cognitive ability as latent variables The developed model takes the form of a nonlinear mixed-effects model Maximum-likelihood estimation in this model induces a data-driven criterion for separating disease progression and baseline cognition Applied to data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative the model estimated a timeline of cognitive decline in AD that spans approximately 15 years from the earliest subjective cognitive deficits to severe AD dementia It was demonstrated how direct modeling of latent factors that modify the observed data patterns provide a scaffold for understanding disease progression biomarkers and treatment effects along the continuous time progression of diseaseConclusions The suggested framework enables direct interpretations of factors that modify cognitive decline The results give new insights to the value of biomarkers for staging patients and suggest alternative explanations for previous findings related to accelerated cognitive decline among highly educated patients and patients on symptomatic treatments","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014860v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014860v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Neurology\\\\\\\\n","Raket","/highwire/citation/70689/bibtext",3,"161219-3","16/12/2019","70689"

"Automatic detection of generalized paroxysmal fast activity in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome using a bi-modal EEG time-frequency feature","Objective Mark-up of generalized interictal epileptiform discharges IEDs on EEG is an important step in the diagnosis and characterization of epilepsy However manual EEG mark-up is a time-consuming subjective and highly specialized task where the human reviewer needs to visually inspect a large amount of data to facilitate accurate clinical decisions The objective of this study was to develop a framework for automated detection of generalized paroxysmal fast activity GPFA  which is a characteristic type of generalized IED seen in scalp EEG recordings of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome LGS a severe form of drug-resistant generalized epilepsyMethods We studied 13 children with LGS who had GPFA events in their interictal EEG recordings Time-frequency information derived from manually marked IEDs across multiple EEG channels was used to automatically detect similar events in each patients interictal EEG We validated true positives and false positives of the proposed spike detection approach using both standalone scalp EEG and simultaneous EEG-functional MRI EEG-fMRI recordingsResults GPFA events displayed a consistent low-high frequency arrangement in the time-frequency domain This bi-modal spectral feature was most prominent over frontal EEG channels Our automatic detection approach using this feature identified likely epileptic events with similar time-frequency properties to the manually marked GPFAs Brain maps of EEG-fMRI signal change during these automatically detected IEDs were comparable to the EEG-fMRI brain maps derived from manual IED mark-up Conclusion GPFA events have a characteristic bi-modal time-frequency feature that can be automatically detected from scalp EEG recordings in patients with LGS Validity of this time-frequency feature is demonstrated by EEG-fMRI analysis of automatically detected events which recapitulates the brain maps we have previously shown to underlie generalized IEDs in LGS  Significance This study provides a novel methodology that paves the way for quick automated and objective inspection of generalized IEDs in LGS The proposed framework may be extendable to a wider range of epilepsy syndromes in which monitoring the burden of epileptic activity can aid clinical decision-making For example automated quantification of generalized discharges may permit faster assessment of treatment response and estimation of future seizure risk","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016089v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016089v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Neurology\\\\\\\\n","Omidvarnia","/highwire/citation/70981/bibtext",2,"030120-2","03/01/2020","70981"

"Immunologic and epidemiologic drivers of norovirus transmission in daycare and school outbreaks","Background Norovirus outbreaks are notoriously explosive with dramatic symptomology and rapid disease spread Children are particularly vulnerable to infection and drive norovirus transmission due to their high contact rates with each other and the environment Despite the explosive nature of norovirus outbreaks attack rates in schools and daycares remain low with the majority of students not reporting symptoms Methods We explore immunologic and epidemiologic mechanisms that may underlie epidemic norovirus transmission dynamics using a disease transmission model Towards this end we compared different model scenarios including innate resistance and acquired immunity collectively denoted immunity stochastic extinction and an individual exclusion intervention We calibrated our model to daycare and school outbreaks from national surveillance dataResults Recreating the low attack rates observed in daycare and school outbreaks required a model with immunity However immunity alone resulted in shorter duration outbreaks than what was observed The addition of individual exclusion to the immunity model extended outbreak durations by reducing the amount of time that symptomatic people contribute to transmission Including both immunity and individual exclusion mechanisms resulted in simulations where both attack rates and outbreak durations were consistent with surveillance dataConclusions The epidemiology of norovirus outbreaks in daycare and school settings cannot be well described by a simple transmission model in which all individuals start as fully susceptible Interventions should leverage population immunity and encourage more rigorous individual exclusion to improve venue-level control measures","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015396v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015396v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Epidemiology\\\\\\\\n","Havumaki","/highwire/citation/70822/bibtext",58,"030120-58","03/01/2020","70822"

"Estimation of Quasi-Continuous Blood Pressure based on Harmonic Phase-Shifts in Signals using Non-Invasive Photoplethysmographic Measurements","According to the guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol revision 2010 the requirements for long time blood pressure measurement BPM are simple handling robustness against movements accuracy of better than 5 mmHg and above all that the patients motion should not be restricted during measurement These requirements are in particular important for a reliable interpretation of the blood pressure BP of hypertensive patients because such a diagnosis will usually be confirmed by long-term measurement Moreover to be able to correlate the patients BP with his normal daily activity non-obstructive non-invasive methods are desired to reduce the patients load The main concern of this paper is to present a novel method for estimating non-invasive continuous blood pressure CBP from a single photoplethysmography PPG signal In contrast to the pulse transit time PTT method our approach is based on the assumption that the phase-velocities of the fundamental and higher harmonics depend on the non-linear elastic properties of the arteries Consequently phase velocity varies as a function of a vessels instantaneous dilation and can be effectively utilised for CBP estimation In addition to its numerous advantages for a simplified measurement setup we could show that the method achieves a high degree of correlation for a reliable BP estimation from PPG data Comparison with state-of-the-art PTT methods was carried out using a dataset from the PhysioBank Database comprising a reference invasive blood pressure IBP signal measured at the radial artery a PPG signal measured at the fingertip and a standard ECG signal The correlation values obtained from the long-time estimation of the systolic blood pressure SBP were as high as r  08945 while the value for the diastolic blood pressure DBP was found to be r  09082 and the correlation of the mean blood pressure MBP was r  09322 These results were achieved by analysing the dataset in a beat-to-beat manner and regarding several post-processing procedures like coherent averaging CA and zero padding with quasi-continuous frequency domain estimation and artificially refined frequency resolution","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015321v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015321v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Health Informatics\\\\\\\\n","Kern","/highwire/citation/70820/bibtext",60,"030120-60","03/01/2020","70820"

"Cost-effectiveness of the next generation of RSV intervention strategies","BackgroundWith a suite of promising new RSV prophylactics on the horizon including long-acting monoclonal antibodies and new vaccines it is likely that one or more of these will replace the current monoclonal Palivizumab programme However choosing the optimal intervention programme will require balancing the costs of the programmes with the health benefits accrued MethodsTo compare the next generation of RSV prophylactics we integrated a novel transmission model with an economic analysis We estimated key epidemiological parameters by calibrating the model to seven years of historical epidemiological data using a Bayesian approach We determined the cost-effective and affordable maximum purchase price for a comprehensive suite of intervention programmes  FindingsOur transmission model suggests that maternal protection of infants is seasonal with 2-14 of infants born with protection against RSV Our economic analysis found that to cost-effectively and affordably replace the current monoclonal antibody Palivizumab programme with long-acting monoclonal antibodies the purchase price per dose would have to be less than around UFFE14350 but dropping to UFFE1200 for vaccinated heightened risk infants or UFFE190 for all infants A seasonal maternal vaccine would have to be priced less than UFFE185 to be cost-effective and affordable While vaccinating pre-school and school-age children is likely not cost-effective relative to elderly vaccination programmes vaccinating the elderly is not likely to be affordable Conversely vaccinating infants at 2 months seasonally would be cost-effective and affordable if priced less than UFFE180 InterpretationsIn a setting with seasonal RSV epidemiology maternal protection conferred to newborns is also seasonal an assumption not previously incorporated in transmission models of RSV For a country with seasonal RSV dynamics like England seasonal programmes rather than year-round intervention programmes are always optimal","/content/10.1101/19009977v4?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009977v4.full.pdf","2020-01-23","Public and Global Health\\\\\\\\n","Hodgson","/highwire/citation/71329/bibtext",9,"240120-9","24/01/2020","71329"

"Neural stimulation and recording performance in human somatosensory cortex over 1500 days","Objective Intracortical microstimulation ICMS in somatosensory cortex can restore sensation to people who have lost it due to spinal cord injury or other conditions One potential challenge for chronic ICMS is whether neural recording and stimulation can remain stable over many years This is particularly relevant since the recording quality of implanted microelectrode arrays frequently experience degradation over time and stimulation safety has been considered a potential barrier to the clinical use of ICMS Our objective is to evaluate stability of recordings on intracortical stimulated and non-stimulated electrodes in a human participant across a long period of implantation Additionally we would like to assess the ability to evoke sensations with ICMS over timeApproach In a study investigating intracortical implants for a bidirectional brain-computer interface we implanted microelectrode arrays with sputtered iridium oxide tips in the somatosensory cortex of a human participant with a cervical spinal cord injury We regularly stimulated through electrodes on these microelectrode arrays to evoke tactile sensations on the hand Here we quantify the stability of these electrodes in comparison to non-stimulated electrodes implanted in motor cortex over 1500 days in two ways recorded signal quality and electrode impedances Additionally we quantify the perceptual stability of ICMS-evoked sensations with detection thresholdsMain results We found that recording quality as assessed by the number of electrodes with high-amplitude waveform recordings  100 ÂV peak-to-peak voltage noise and signal-to-noise ratio generally decreased over time on stimulated and non-stimulated electrodes However stimulated electrodes were much more likely to continue to record high-amplitude signals than non-stimulated electrodes Interestingly the detection thresholds for stimulus-evoked tactile sensations decreased over time from a median of 315 ÂA at Day 100 to 104 ÂA at Day 1500 with the most substantial changes occurring between Day 100 and Day 500Significance These results provide evidence that ICMS in human somatosensory cortex can be provided over long periods of time without deleterious effects on recording or stimulation capabilities In fact psychophysical sensitivity to stimulation improves over time and stimulation itself may promote more robust long-term neural recordings","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20018341v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20018341v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Neurology\\\\\\\\n","Hughes","/highwire/citation/71421/bibtext",18,"280120-18","28/01/2020","71421"

"Estimation of Rift Valley fever virus spillover to humans during the Mayotte 2018-2019 epidemic","Background Rift Valley fever RVF is an emerging zoonotic arboviral haemorrhagic fever threatening livestock and humans mainly in Africa In the absence of a human vaccine estimating the transmission potential of RVF virus from livestock to humans is key to assessing the impact of livestock disease control measures on preventing human diseaseMethods We combined a unique RVF dataset with livestock and human surveillance data of the 2018-2019 RVF epidemic in Mayotte and used them in a mathematical model Using Bayesian inference we quantified the transmission amongst livestock and spillover to humans and we assessed the impact of livestock vaccination on reducing human disease riskFindings Vaccination scenarios indicate that early livestock vaccination December 2018 would have reduced the human epidemic size by a third whilst vaccinating one month later required using 50  more vaccine doses for a similar impact In addition the likelihood of virus re-emergence in the next rainy season 2019-2020 was estimated very low with 558  90 Credible Interval 271-595 of the livestock population being immune in August 2019Interpretation Human and livestock health surveillance early detection and timely vaccination in livestock are crucial to reducing disease risk in humans We present the first study quantifying RVF virus spillover using livestock and human data and use this quantitative information to inform on the impact of potential control programmes This demonstrates the value of a One Health approach to surveillance and control of this emerginginfectious disease Funding ARS Ocean Indien EAFRD RITA Mayotte VEEPED Wellcome","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022996v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022996v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Metras","/highwire/citation/72165/bibtext",23,"180220-23","18/02/2020","72165"
"Mapping malaria by sharing spatial information between incidence and prevalence datasets","As malaria incidence decreases and more countries move towards elimination maps of malaria risk in low prevalence areas are increasingly needed For low burden areas disaggregation regression models have been developed to estimate risk at high spatial resolution from routine surveillance reports aggregated by administrative unit polygonsHowever in areas with both routine surveillance data and prevalence surveys models thatmake use of the spatial information from prevalence point-surveys have great potentialUsing case studies in Indonesia Senegal and Madagascar we compare two methods forincorporating point-level spatial information into disaggregation regression models Thefirst simply fits a Gaussian random field to prevalence point-surveys to create a new covariate The second is a multi-likelihood model that is fitted jointly to prevalence point-surveys and polygon incidence data We find that the simple model generally performs better than a baseline disaggregation model while the joint model performance was mixed More generally our results demonstrate that combining these types of data improves estimates of malaria incidence","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023069v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023069v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Lucas","/highwire/citation/72166/bibtext",24,"180220-24","18/02/2020","72166"
"Bias Attributable to Composite Outcome","Background Little guidance is available on how composite outcomes should be interpreted especially in situations of varied direction in the association across the event subtypes I proposed an index to evaluate the bias attributable to composite outcomes BACO and applied it in recently published clinical trialsMethods I defined the BACO index as the ratio between logarithms of the association measures of both a composite outcome and its most relevant component eg any-cause mortality By using the non-linear combination of parameters based on the delta method I calculated the confidence intervals and performed Wald-type tests for the null hypotheses BACO index  1 I applied this method in systematically selected clinical trials and in two other preselected trials which I considered positive controls These last trials have been recognized as examples of primary composite outcomes that were disregarded because of inconsistency with the treatment effect on mortality Results BACO index values different from one were classified according to whether the use of composite outcomes overestimated BACO index 1 underestimated BACO index between zero and 1 or inverted BACO index 0 the association between exposure and prognosis In three of 23 clinical trials and the two positive controls the BACO indices were significantly lower than one using p 0005 as a preset cutoff Conclusion Based on the BACO index testing researchers could predefined rules to make impartial decisions about maintaining a composite outcome as the primary endpoint or to state cautions regarding its interpretation","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20020966v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20020966v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Diaz-Quijano","/highwire/citation/72167/bibtext",25,"180220-25","18/02/2020","72167"
"Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus COVID-19","BackgroundEstimation of the fraction and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus COVID-19 infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease Many mild infections are typically not reported and depending on their contagiousness may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection  MethodsHere we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness  ResultsWe estimate 86 of all infections were undocumented 95 CI 82-90 prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown January 23 2020 Per person these undocumented infections were 52 as contagious as documented infections 44-69 and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases Our estimate of the reproductive number 223 177-300 aligns with earlier findings however after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerablyConclusionsA majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23 and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak increased use of personal protective measures and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection however it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023127v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023127v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Li","/highwire/citation/72168/bibtext",26,"180220-26","18/02/2020","72168"

"Genetic Cellular and Connectomic Characterization of the Adult Human Brain Regions Commonly Plagued by Glioma","Introduction For decades it has been known that gliomas follow a non-random spatial distribution appearing more often in some brain regions eg the insula than others eg the occipital lobe A better understanding of the localization patterns of glioma could lend clues to the origins of these types of brain tumors Following hypotheses derived from prior research into neuropsychiatric disease and cancer gliomas may be expected to localize to functional hub regions of the brain regions populated by stem-like cells and regions enriched with transcription of genetic determinants of glioma Methods A tumor frequency map was derived using MRI data from 335 adult patients with high- and low-grade glioma accessed from the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge BraTS First the connectomic correlates of this map were explored by comparing distributions of tumor frequency across canonical subnetworks and regions of high functional connectivity and centrality Second glioma frequency across brain regions known to contain sources of neural stem cells ie the hippocampus and the caudate was compared to glioma frequency across random sets of parcels Post-mortem microarray data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas AHBA was used to estimate oligodendrocyte precursor cell distribution across the brain and the spatial correspondence of this measure with tumor frequency was tested Third AHBA data was also used for a partial least squares PLS regression analysis relating spatial transcription patterns of 20647 genes to glioma distribution The resulting ranked lists of genes related to glioma distribution were tested for enrichment of an a priori set of genes thought to drive gliomagenesis Finally we constructed a multiple linear regression model combining all of the significant factors across the study into one model predicting glioma distributionResults Glioma frequency was elevated in association cortex and positively correlated with measures of functional hubness Regions of the brain populated with stem-like cells such as neural stem cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells exhibited a high glioma frequency PLS regression relating gene expression patterns to glioma frequency determined two components PLS1 and PLS2 that respectively explained 19 and 18 of the variance in glioma distribution PLS1 was enriched with genes most strongly associated with chromatin organization whereas PLS2 was related to synaptic signaling along with a broad set of metabolic processes Interestingly PLS1 was enriched with an a priori set of glioma proto-oncogenes A multiple linear regression model incorporating the topological cellular and genetic contributions to tumor frequency was able to explain 58 of the variance in glioma distribution about the brain and revealed that each of these factors were independent predictors of tumor frequencyConclusion Glioma distribution can in part be explained by functional hubness distributions of stem-like cells and transcription patterns of genetic determinants of glioma These results add to previous literature reporting the vulnerability of hub regions to neurological disease and provide support for cancer stem cell theories of glioma Our findings illustrate how factors of diverse scale from genetic to connectomic can independently influence the anatomic localization of oncogenesis","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20018531v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20018531v2.full.pdf","2020-02-20",NA,"Mandal","/highwire/citation/72351/bibtext",48,"210220-48","21-02-2020","72351"

"Childhood immune imprinting to influenza A shapes birth year-specific risk during seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 epidemics","Across decades of co-circulation in humans influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have caused seasonal epidemics characterized by different age distributions of infection and mortality H3N2 causes the majority of cases in high-risk elderly cohorts and the majority of overall deaths whereas H1N1 causes incidence shifted towards young and middle-aged adults and fewer deaths These contrasting age profiles may result from differences in childhood exposure to H1N1 and H3N2 or from differences in evolutionary rate between subtypes Here we analyze a large epidemiological surveillance dataset to test whether childhood immune imprinting shapes seasonal influenza epidemiology and if so whether it acts primarily via immune memory of a particular influenza subtype or via broader immune memory that protects across subtypes We also test the impact of evolutionary differences between influenza subtypes on age distributions of infection Likelihood-based model comparison shows that narrow within-subtype imprinting is the strongest driver of seasonal influenza risk The data do not support a strong effect of evolutionary rate or of broadly protective imprinting that acts across subtypes Our findings emphasize that childhood exposures can imprint a lifelong immunological bias toward particular influenza subtypes and that these cohort-specific biases shape epidemic age distributions As a result newer and less senior antibody responses acquired later in life do not provide the same strength of protection as responses imprinted in childhood  Finally we project that the relatively low mortality burden of H1N1 may increase in the coming decades as cohorts that lack H1N1-specific imprinting eventually reach old age","/content/10.1101/19001834v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001834v1.full.pdf","2019-07-13","Epidemiology\\\\\\\\n","Gostic","/highwire/citation/68320/bibtext",131,"210220-131","21-02-2020","68320"
"Hidden heterogeneity and its influence on dengue vaccination impact","The CYD-TDV vaccine was recently developed to combat dengue a mosquito-borne viral disease that afflicts millions of people each year throughout the tropical and subtropical world Its rollout has been complicated by recent findings that vaccinees with no prior exposure to dengue virus DENV experience an elevated risk of severe disease in response to their first DENV infection subsequent to vaccination As a result of these findings guidelines for use of CYD-TDV now require serological screening prior to vaccination to establish that an individual does not fall into this high-risk category These complications mean that the public health impact of CYD-TDV vaccination is expected to be higher in areas with higher transmission One important practical difficulty with tailoring vaccination policy to local transmission contexts is that DENV transmission is spatially heterogeneous even at the scale of neighborhoods or blocks within a city This raises the question of whether models based on data that average over spatial heterogeneity in transmission could fail to capture important aspects of CYD-TDV impact in spatially heterogeneous populations We explored this question with a deterministic model of DENV transmission and CYD-TDV vaccination in a population comprised of two communities with differing transmission intensities Compared to the full model a version of the model based on the average of the two communities failed to capture benefits of targeting the intervention to the high-transmission community which resulted in greater impact in both communities than we observed under even coverage In addition the model based on the average of the two communities substantially overestimated impact among vaccinated individuals in the low-transmission community In the event that the specificity of serological screening is not high this result suggests that models that ignore spatial heterogeneity could overlook the potential for harm to this segment of the population","/content/10.1101/19006783v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006783v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Epidemiology\\\\\\\\n","Walters","/highwire/citation/69098/bibtext",132,"210220-132","21-02-2020","69098"

"Genetic risk of obesity as a modifier of associations between neighbourhood environment and body mass index an observational study of 335046 UK Biobank participants","Background There is growing recognition that recent global increases in obesity are the product of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors However in gene-environment studies of obesity environment usually refers to individual behavioural factors that influence energy balance while more upstream environmental factors are overlooked We examined gene-environment interactions between genetic risk of obesity and two neighbourhood characteristics likely to be associated with obesity proximity to takeaway/fast-food outlets and availability of physical activity facilities and genetic risk of obesity Methods We used data from 335046 adults aged 40-70 in the UK Biobank cohort to conduct a population-based cross-sectional study of interactions between neighbourhood characteristics and genetic risk of obesity in relation to BMI Proximity to a fast-food outlet was defined as distance from home address to nearest takeaway/fast-food outlet and availability of physical activity facilities as the number of formal physical activity facilities within one kilometre of home address Genetic risk of obesity was operationalised by 91-SNP and 69-SNP weighted genetic risk scores and by six individual SNPs considered separately Multivariable mixed effects models with product terms for the gene-environment interactions were estimated Results After accounting for likely confounding the association between proximity to takeaway/fast-food outlets and BMI was stronger among those at increased genetic risk of obesity with evidence of an interaction with polygenic risk scores P0018 and P0028 for 69-SNP and 91-SNP scores respectively and in particular with a SNP linked to MC4R P0009 a gene known to regulate food intake We found very little evidence of a gene-environment interaction for availability of physical activity facilities  Conclusions Individuals at an increased genetic risk of obesity may be more sensitive to exposure to the local fast-food environment  Ensuring that neighbourhood residential environments are designed to promote a healthy weight may be particularly important for those with greater genetic susceptibility to obesity","/content/10.1101/19004671v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004671v1.full.pdf","2019-08-20","Epidemiology\\\\\\\\n","Mason","/highwire/citation/68813/bibtext",147,"210220-147","21-02-2020","68813"

"Health workers experiences of coping with the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo health system a qualitative study of variables of hospital activities on infection control practices in Kinshasa city","Background Health workers play an important role during epidemics but there is limited research on hospital activities on infection control practices in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and how health workers can cope during a probable health epidemic in Kinshasa city The 2019 Ebola Virus Disease epidemic evolve in alarming ways in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the recently  involvement of 2 cases to Uganda a neighbouring country making this outbreak the most complex and high risk ever experienced by the Democratic Republic of the Congo The country struggles to control it against a backdrop of a health system that is already over-burdened This paper explores the challenges of a contamination in the context of an Ebola outbreak that may face health workers and their coping strategies in thirteen hospitals of reference in Kinshasa hoping to educate or remember good practices for health workers in Kinshasa that is also available for health workers in the East Area of the country where actually the Ebola outbreak is spreading North Kivu and Ituri We provide early epidemiological information arising from the ongoing investigation of this outbreak and the unpublished data in the evaluation of the level of biosecurity BS in the emergency rooms and laboratories of 13 hospitals of reference of the capital cityMethodsWe classified cases as suspected probable or confirmed using national case definitions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministry of Public Health We obtain data from the Ministry of Public Health that determined Uganda cases possible exposures in health zonesWe also estimated the Health workers experiences of coping with the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo health system We used a qualitative study of variables of hospital activities on infection control practices in thirteen reference health facilities in Kinshasa We used key informant interviews with health facility managers and in depth interviews with health workers working in public and private reference hospitals in Kinshasa With this intention 20 parameters were the subject of the investigation  In order to characterize the profile of these health facilities the collected data were submitted on the one hand with the analysis in principal components and other hand with the technique of ascending hierarchicalFindingsThe unidimensional analysis led parameter by parameter showed that the standards of BS were respected by at least 75  of the health facilities for the 6 following parameters 1 material of taking away of single use 2 disinfection of material and the desk 3 good lighting of the rooms 4 not encumbered waiting room 5 adequate conservation of the biological specimens and 6 regular emptying of the baskets With the extreme for 2 following parameters the standards of BS were respected only by at most 25  of the health facilities 1 wearing of gloves by the health workers and 2 disinfection of the instruments of examination The other parameters had obtained a note going from weak to badInterpretationThe ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has similar epidemiological features to previous Ebola virus disease outbreak in Sierra Leone 1 Early detection rapid patient isolation contact tracing and the ongoing vaccination programme should sufficiently control the outbreak The forecast of the number of health workers 119 cases remember the contamination risk The information presented although preliminary is essential in guiding the ongoing investigation and response to this outbreak The health workforce is inadequate and ill-equipped to deal with an outbreak including limited national means for research support for 40 years by the Congolese government In the Democratic Republic of the Congo the research is not funded researchers are struggling themselves so without means we did this qualitative study that began in a functional parasitology disease unit in the Kinshasa University Hospital headed by the late Pr Dr Paul Mulumba Madishala ConclusionsWith regard to the characterization of the profile of the hospitals in the field of the respect of the standards of BS all the 20 parameters considered overall this one showed that this profile went from excellent to poor The Bondeko-Ngaliema-Monkole group has occupied the first rank while the group Kintambo-King Baudouin-Ndjili-Makala occupied the other end of the scale the other health facilities occupied an intermediate position Among the 7 hospitals which were placed at the top of this classification of BS 5 were massively subsidized by international NGO which explains to a great extent their performances in one hand another hand finding its explanation in the quality of their management It is the case of Bondeko Monkole Kalembe-Lembe St Joseph and Kingasani 2Keywords Health workforce Biosecurity Epidemic Democratic Republic of the

"Intranasal oxytocin enhances approach-related EEG frontal alpha asymmetry during engagement of direct eye contact","The neuropeptide oxytocin is suggested to exert a pivotal role in a variety of complex human behaviors including interpersonal bonding trust and attachment Recent theories have suggested that the role oxytocin plays in these complex social behaviors involves a modulation of motivational tendencies of approach/avoidance-related behaviors However to date direct neurophysiological evidence supporting this notion is limited In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study with parallel design we assessed the effects of administered intranasal oxytocin in 40 adult men on gaze behavior and a neural marker of approach/avoidance motivational tendencies Specifically electroencephalography recordings were performed during the engagement of eye contact with a live model in a naturalistic two-person social context and electroencephalographic frontal alpha asymmetry an established neurophysiological index of motivational tendencies for approach/avoidance-related behaviors was assessed Compared to placebo a single dose of oxytocin 24 international units was shown to increase relative left-sided frontal asymmetry upon direct eye contact with a live model which is indicative of an increase in approach-related motivational tendencies toward the presented eye contact stimulus Notably the treatment effect was most prominently observed in participants with lower self-reported social motivation higher Motivation subscale scores on the Social Responsiveness Scale indicating that participants with lower social motivation benefitted the most from the administered oxytocin No treatment-specific changes were identified in terms of gaze behavior toward the eye region of the live model Together these observations add neurophysiological evidence to the hypothesized role of oxytocin in modulating approach/avoidance related tendencies and suggest that inter-individual variance in person-dependent factors need to be considered in order to evaluate the potential benefit of intranasal oxytocin as a treatment This notion is of particular relevance to the variety of neuropsychiatric populations such as autism spectrum disorder social anxiety disorder and depression for which intranasal oxytocin is increasingly considered a potential treatment","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028266v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028266v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology\\\\\\\\n","Soriano","/highwire/citation/72712/bibtext",87,"270220-87","27-02-2020","72712"

"Association of Cardiovascular Manifestations with In-hospital Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 A Hospital Staff Data","Background The outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 remain a huge threat to the public health worldwide Clinical data is limited up to now regarding nosocomial infection of COVID-19 and the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19Aims This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of nosocomial infection and explain the association of cardiovascular manifestations CVMs with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases Methods Retrospective single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan China from January 15 to January 24 2020 Epidemiological demographic clinical laboratory radiological treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed Final date of follow-up was March 3 2020 A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMsResults Of all clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 805 while nosocomial infection by patient contact accounted for 878 The population was presented with a mean age of 391 - 92 and less comorbidities than community population and featured predominantly mild course 951 The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever 829 myalgia or fatigue 805 and cough 634 While the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue 805 fever 732 and cough 415 There were 951 cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 585 and 415 respectively Compared with cases without CVMs patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count 099 - 043 and 155 - 061 P0001 more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission 500 and 118 P0011 and more received oxygen support 792 and 235 P0001 The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group 750 and 235 P0001 Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse eventsConclusions Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 were nosocomial infection featured non-severe course of disease Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients","/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348v2.full.pdf","2020-03-05","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Gender differences in patients with COVID-19 Focus on severity and mortality","Importance The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Disease COVID-19 has put the world on alert that is reminiscent of the SARS outbreak seventeen years ago Objective We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessmentDesign Setting and Participants We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS including 139 deaths from Beijing city in early 2003Main Outcomes and Measures Severity and mortalityResults Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS The percentages of older age 65 years were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 838 vs 132 P0001 and SARS 374 vs 49 P0001 In the case series men tend to be more serious than women P0035 although age was comparable between men and women In the public data set age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19 Meanwhile gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19 However the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group 703 vs 500 P0015 The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients Survival analysis showed that men hazard ratio 95 CI 147 105-206 P 0025 had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with SARSConclusions and Relevance Older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with COVID While men and women have the same susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026864v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026864v2.full.pdf","2020-03-05","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 suggest multiple outbreak sources of transmission","We examined 169 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and found that they can be classified into two major genotypes Type I and Type II Type I can be further divided into Type IA and IB Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the Type IA resembles the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 most Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else because the patients had no direct link to the market Furthermore by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains which might explain why Type II strains are predominant implying that Type II is more contagious transmissible than Type I These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2.full.pdf","2020-03-05","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Contacts in context large-scale setting-specific social mixing matrices from the BBC Pandemic project","Social mixing patterns are crucial in driving transmission of infectious diseases and informing public health interventions to contain their spread Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants In addition such surveys are rare so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context home work school other and type conversational or physical of contact that took place These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population such as school closures social distancing or working from home In addition they finally provide the possibility to use multiple sources of social mixing data to evaluate the uncertainty that stems from social mixing when designing public health interventions","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023754v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023754v2.full.pdf","2020-03-05","Epidemiology
