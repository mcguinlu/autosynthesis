"Novel meta-analysis pipeline of heterogeneous high-throughput gene expression datasets reveals dysregulated interactions and pathways in asthma","Introduction: Asthma is a complex and chronic inflammatory disorder with varying degrees of airway inflammation. It affects ~235 million people worldwide, and about 8% of the United States population. Unlike single-gene disorders, asthma phenotypes are guided by a highly variable combination of genotypes, making it a complex disease to study computationally. Recently, several independent high-throughput gene expression studies in bioinformatics have identified and proposed numerous molecular drivers involved in asthma initiation and progression. However, there is a poor consensus in our understanding of the molecular factors involved in the mechanism of this disease due to inherent genetic heterogeneity. Such an uncertainty in bioinformatics studies have led to a ""reproducibility crisis"" in the field, where similar analyses can often yield greatly varying results. In this study, we seek to harness heterogeneity in asthma by applying a meta-analysis that explores varying tissue environments.

Methods: We use three publicly-available microarray gene expression datasets, belonging to different tissues in asthma patients, from NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). As a meta-analysis, we apply a mixed-model effect size test to determine differentially expressed (DE) genes across all three studies. Then, The datasets are pre-processed and subjected to Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) for identification of functional modules. Using module preservation, we determine modules in asthma that were not preserved in the healthy condition, then combine the three with a Fisher's test for a set of asthma-unique modules. These modules are explored using functional analysis (i.e. GO term analysis). Using the DE genes as well as known transcription factors, we re-construct Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) for each of our shortlisted modules. We then studied the topology of these GRNs using hive plots to reveal underlying dysregulations, paving the way for future analyses.  

Results: Our analysis reveals a novel perspective to a key interaction in asthma inflammatory regulation, the CHD4-CCL26 transcription relation. Our hive plot analysis is able to explore this gene interaction beyond the typical ""over-expression, under-expression"" results from typical bioinformatics studies. We reveal that CCL26, an important regulator of asthma, appears to increase in expression and topological degree in asthma, but loses connection to CHD4, which seems to be characteristic to the asthma disease. Such analysis suggests that the topology of gene networks, above simply expression values, may be key to understanding the nuanced interactions between fundamental biomarkers and drug targets in complex diseases like asthma.","/content/10.1101/19012377v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012377v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Allergy and Immunology

"Appraisal of the pleiotropic effects of intelligence and education on schizophrenia: a univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization study","Education and intelligence are highly correlated and inversely associated with schizophrenia. Counterintuitively, education genetically associates with an increased risk for the disease. To investigate why, this study applies a multivariable Mendelian randomization of intelligence and education. For those without college degrees, older age of finishing school associates with a decreased likelihood of schizophrenia, independent of intelligence, and, hence, may be entangled with the health inequalities reflecting differences in education. A different picture is observed for schooling years inclusive of college: more years of schooling increases the likelihood of schizophrenia, whereas higher intelligence distinctly and independently decreases it. This implies the pleiotropy between years of schooling and schizophrenia is horizontal and likely confounded by a third trait influencing education. A multivariable Mendelian randomization of schooling years and bipolar disorder reveals that the increased risk of schizophrenia conferred by more schooling years is an artefact of bipolar disorder, not education.","/content/10.1101/19012401v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012401v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Limited Capacity for Ipsilateral Secondary Motor Areas to Support Hand Function Post-Stroke","Recent findings have shown connections of ipsilateral cortico-reticulospinal tract (CRST), predominantly originating from secondary motor areas, to not only proximal but also distal portions of the arm. In unilateral stroke, CRST from the ipsilateral side is intact and thus has been proposed as a possible backup system for post-stroke rehabilitation even for the hand. We argue that although CRST from ipsilateral secondary motor areas can provide control for proximal joints, it is insufficient to control either hand or coordinated shoulder and hand movements due to its extensive branching compared to contralateral corticospinal tract. To address this issue, we combined MRI, high-density EEG, and robotics in 17 individuals with severe chronic hemiparetic stroke and 12 age-matched controls. We tested for changes in structural morphometry of the sensorimotor cortex and found that individuals with stroke demonstrated higher gray matter density in secondary motor areas ipsilateral to the paretic arm compared to controls. We then measured cortical activity while participants attempted to generate hand opening either supported on a table or while lifting against a shoulder abduction load. The addition of shoulder abduction during hand opening increased reliance on ipsilateral secondary motor areas in stroke, but not controls. Crucially, increased use of ipsilateral secondary motor areas was associated with decreased hand opening ability while lifting the arm due to involuntary coupling between the shoulder and wrist/finger flexors. Together, this evidence implicates a compensatory role for ipsilateral (i.e., contralesional) secondary motor areas post-stroke, but with limited capacity to support hand function.","/content/10.1101/19012336v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012336v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Step-downs reduce workers compensation payments to encourage return to work. Are they effective?","Objective:
To determine whether step-downs, which cut the rate of compensation paid to injured workers after they have been on benefits for several months, incentivise return to work.
Methods:
We aggregated administrative claims data from nine Australian workers compensation systems to calculate weekly scheme exit rates, a proxy for return to work. Jurisdictions were further subdivided into four condition subgroups: fractures, musculoskeletal, mental health, and other trauma. The effect of step-downs on scheme exit was tested using a regression discontinuity design. Results were pooled into meta-analyses to calculate combined effects and the proportion of variance attributable to heterogeneity.
Results:
The combined effect of step-downs was a 0.61 percentage point (95% CI -1.16 to -0.05) reduction in the exit rate, with significant heterogeneity between jurisdictions (I2 = 73%, p = .001). Most significant effects were observed within earliest step-downs, implemented at 13 weeks of benefit payment. Within condition subgroups, only fractures had a significant combined effect (-0.84, 95% CI -1.61 to -0.07), and sensitivity analysis suggested a potentially meaningful effect among mental health claims as well.
Conclusions:
The results suggest step-downs prompt an anticipatory effect, meaning some claimants leave compensation ahead of the step-down to avoid the reduction in benefits. However, the effects were small and, given their anticipatory nature, probably short-lived. Our findings were statistically significant, but questions remain about practical significance. We find limited evidence that step-downs are an effective incentive for return to work.","/content/10.1101/19012286v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012286v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Psoriasis Patients Treated with Anti-Interleukin-17 Agents: A Bayesian Metaanalysis","Background: Use of interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i) in psoriasis has been associated with an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the clinical significance of this association is not understood. 

Objectives: To quantify the absolute risk of IBD in patients with psoriasis treated with IL-17i, stratified by known IBD risk factors. 

Methods: Literature searches were performed to identify known IBD risk factors and the prevalences were quantified by a meta-analysis of proportions. The Bayesian model was used to estimate the probability of a new-onset or a flare of IBD in patients with psoriasis. 

Results: The prevalence of Crohn disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) in the general psoriasis population was 0.0010. Use of IL-17i increased the risk of CD to 0.0037 and UC to 0.0028, translating to a number needed to harm (NNH) of 373 for CD and 564 for UC. In patients who had concomitant hidradenitis suppurativa, the use of IL-17i was associated with a decrease in NNH for CD and UC to 18 and 76, respectively, whereas for patients with a family history of IBD, the NNH values were 6 (for CD) and 10 (for UC). 

Conclusions:  In patients with no risk factors, the probability of IBD flare or onset during IL-17i treatment is negligible and additional IBD screening procedures are not indicated. In contrast, the patients with psoriasis who have hidradenitis suppurativa or first-degree family history of IBD as risk factors should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CD and UC during IL-17i therapy.","/content/10.1101/19012179v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012179v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Dermatology

"Dysmetabolic circulating tumor cells are prognostic in Metastatic Breast Cancer","The prognostic value of the circulating tumor cells (CTCs), defined as EpCAM+, Cytokeratin (8, 18, 19)+ and CD45- nucleated cells, has been provided in metastatic breast cancer (mBC), with Level I of evidence. However, CTCs belong to a heterogeneous pool of rare cells, and there is not consensus on an univocal definition of CTCs. Here, we present a definition of metabolically altered CTCs (MBA-CTC) as CD45-negative cells with an increased extracellular acidification rate (iECAR), supported by the presence of iECAR among the hallmarks of cancer. We tested the prognostic value of MBA-CTC present in mBC patients before starting a new systemic therapy (T0) and 3-4 weeks after (T1). Samples were analyzed in parallel with CellSearch platform (CS). Standard RECIST criteria were used to determine patients' responses to treatment. 
In our cohort of n=31 mBC patients, a level of MBA-CTCs above the cut-off was associated with: i) a shorter median PFS both pre-therapy (123 days vs 306; p<0.0001) and during therapy (139 vs 266 days; p= 0.0009); ii) a worse OS both pre-therapy (p=0.0003, 82% survival vs 20%) and during therapy (p=0.0301, 67% survival vs 38%); iii) good agreement with therapy response (kappa=0.685). Both the trend of MBA-CTCs over time and the combined results of the two assays (MBA and CS) enabled more accurate stratification. MBA and CS results showed fair (K=0.33) and poor (K=0.077) agreement at T0 and T1, respectively. This fact and the increased accuracy in combining results suggest that the assays detect different CTC subsets. In conclusion, MBA-CTCs does provide prognostic information at least equivalent to CS, and are even more informative when analyzed over time or combined with CS-CTCs.","/content/10.1101/19012211v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012211v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Oncology

"StartReact increases probability of muscle activity and distance in severe/moderate stroke survivors during two-dimensional reaching task.","Objective: StartReact elicits faster, larger, and more appropriate muscle activation in stroke survivors but has been only cursorily studied to date during multi-jointed reaching. Our objective was to evaluate StartReact on unrestricted, two-dimensional point-to-point reaching tasks post-stroke. 
Method: Data from 23 individuals with stroke was collected during point-to-point reaching. Voluntary and StartReact trials were compared between mild, severe/moderate, and the unimpaired arm. 
Results: StartReact showed an increase in probability of muscle activity, larger muscle activity amplitude and faster muscle activity onset. Despite changes in muscle activity, metrics of movement (distance, final error, linear deviation) were largely the same between StartReact and Voluntary trials except in severe/moderate stroke who had larger reaching distances during StartReact. 
Conclusion: While StartReact impacted many metrics of muscle activity, the most profound effect was on probability of muscle activity increasing 34% compared to Voluntary which allowed severe/moderate subjects to increase reaching distance but did not translate to decrease in final error suggesting that the additional movement was not always directed towards the appropriate target. 
Significance: These results indicate that SR has the capacity to activate paralyzed muscle in severe/moderate patients, but future studies are needed to explore the possible use of SR in the rehabilitation.

"Closed Loop Deep Brain Stimulation for Freezing of Gait","Freezing of gait (FOG), a devastating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), can be refractory to current treatments such as medication and open-loop deep brain stimulation (olDBS). Recent evidence suggests that closed-loop DBS (clDBS), using beta local field potential power from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) as the control variable, can improve tremor and bradykinesia; however, no study has investigated the use of clDBS for the treatment of FOG. In this study, we provide preliminary evidence that clDBS was superior to olDBS in reducing percent time freezing and in reducing freezing behavior (gait arrhythmicity) in two people with PD and FOG, with less total energy delivered. These findings warrant further investigation into the use of clDBS to treat FOG while also minimizing the total energy delivered to maintain a therapeutic effect.","/content/10.1101/19011858v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011858v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Neurology

"Validity of the Cold Pressor Test and Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire via online self-administration","To determine the feasibility of complex home-based phenotyping, 1,876 research participants from the customer base of 23andMe participated in an online version of a Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ) as well as a cold pressor test (CPT) which is used in clinical assessments of pain. Overall our online version of the PSQ performed similarly to the original pen-and-paper version. Construct validity of the PSQ total was demonstrated by internal consistency and consistent discrimination between more and less painful items. Criterion validity was demonstrated by correlation with pain sensitivity as measured by the cold pressor test. Within the same cohort we performed a cold pressor test using a layperson description and household equipment. Comparison with published reports from controlled studies revealed similar distributions of cold pain tolerance times (i.e., time elapsed before removing the hand from the water). Of those who elected to participate in the CPT, a large majority of participants did not report issues with the test procedure or noncompliance to the instructions (97%). We confirmed a large sex difference in CPT thresholds in line with published data, such that women removed their hands from the water at a median of 54.2 seconds, with men lasting for a median time of 82.7 seconds (Kruskal-Wallis statistic, p < 0.0001), but other factors like age or current pain treatment were at most weakly associated, and inconsistently between men and women. We introduce a new paradigm for performing pain testing, called testing@home, that, in the case of cold nociception, showed comparable results to studies conducted under controlled conditions and supervision of a health care professional.","/content/10.1101/19011775v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011775v1.full.pdf","2019-11-18","Pain Medicine

"Cognitive functioning and lifetime Major Depressive Disorder in UK Biobank","Background. Cognitive impairment associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is well-supported by meta-analytic studies, but population-based estimates remain scarce. Previous UK Biobank studies have only shown limited evidence of cognitive differences related to probable MDD. Using updated cognitive and clinical assessments in UK Biobank, this study investigated population-level differences in cognitive functioning associated with lifetime MDD. 
Methods. Associations between lifetime MDD and cognition (performance on six tasks and  general cognitive functioning (g-factor)) were investigated in UK Biobank (N-range 7,457-14,836, age 45-81 years, 52% female), adjusting for demographics, education and lifestyle. Lifetime MDD classifications were based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Within the lifetime MDD group, we additionally investigated relationships between cognition and (i) recurrence, (ii) current symptoms, (iii) severity of psychosocial impairment (while symptomatic), and (iv) concurrent psychotropic medication use.
Results. Lifetime MDD was robustly associated with a lower g-factor (ÃŸ = -0.10, P(FDR) = 4.7x10-5), with impairments in attention, processing speed and executive functioning (ÃŸ = 0.06). Clinical characteristics revealed differential profiles of cognitive impairment among case individuals; those who reported severe psychosocial impairment and use of psychotropic medication performed worse on cognitive tests. Severe psychosocial impairment and reasoning showed the strongest association (ÃŸ = -0.18, P(FDR) = 7.5x10-5).
Conclusions. Findings describe small but robust associations between lifetime MDD and lower cognitive performance within a population based sample. Overall effects were of modest effect size, suggesting limited clinical relevance. However, deficits within specific cognitive domains were more pronounced in relation to clinical characteristics, particularly severe psychosocial impairment.","/content/10.1101/19006031v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006031v2.full.pdf","2019-11-18","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Olanzapine Combined with 5-HT3 RA Plus Dexamethasone for Prevention and Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting in High and Moderate Emetogenic Chemotherapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","Objectives: We performed a pooled analysis to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of olanzapine combined with dexamethasone plus compared with 5 HT3 RA plus dexamethasone for the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in high and moderate emetogenic chemotherapy based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature database (CBM), WanFang Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) (from their inception to April 2019) were searched to capture relevant  articles. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CINV and AEs were all extracted or calculated.
Result: Eleven studies with 1107 cancer patients were involved in this review. The pooled RR of delayed CINV (RR=0.50, 95%CI: 0.38 0.66, P<0.01) were significant decreased in olanzapine group. Besides, the occurrence of insomnia was statistically decreased. The rate of acute CINV (RR=0.60, 95%CI: 0.48 0.75, P<0.01) was also significant decreased. However only the percent of CINV III and CINV IV were significant deceased in acute and delayed phase. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the efficacy was no statistically significant difference between 5mg and 10mg for olanzapine. 
Conclusion: Olanzapine significant decreased the occurrence of CINV III and CINV IV and insomnia in high and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Compared with 10mg per day, 5mg oral may be more appropriate for patients with cancer.","/content/10.1101/19009456v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009456v2.full.pdf","2019-11-18","Oncology

"Violin plot data: A concerto of crucial information on valve thrombogenicity categorized in vitro by valve motion and inferred flow velocity","Abstract:
Objectives 
This in vitro study compares mechanical (MHV) and bioprosthetic (BHV) heart valves for high amplitude short duration regional flow velocities (RFV) near valve closure.
Background 
We previously tested several clinical and prototype valves and observed RFV at levels which may be related to a dimensionless thrombogenic potential (TP).  
Methods 
A total of four valves were tested in aortic and mitral sites under pulsatile circulation in a pulse duplicator. Valves included both clinical models and experimental prototypes. An optical approach measuring projected dynamic valve area (PDVA) to gauge valve motion was implemented. Pulsatile pressures and flow rates were measured by conventional techniques and a quasi-steady flow tester was used to measure valve leakage. RFV was derived using time-dependent volumetric flow rate/PDVA. Since flow velocity and fluid shear force are related through flow velocity gradient, TPs for valves that achieve near closure during the forward flow deceleration phase were determined as RFVs relative to the control mechanical valve RFV value of -126 m/s.  
Results
TP is dimensionless and ranged between -0.45 and +1.0. Negative TPs arise when transient rebound of valve occluders is accompanied by water-hammer phenomena. Positive TPs occur during the decelerating forward flow. Bioprostheses had lowest TP transient of 0.15 with exception of a mock-transcatheter aortic valve (mTAVI) that incorporated by design a trivial perivalvular leak (~1.35 ml/s). This device demonstrated a remarkably high transient TP of 0.95. The control mechanical valves had the highest TP of 1.0. The study implicates TP transients near mechanical valve closure, and not forward or non-flow phases, as primary to shear induced activation of the coagulation cascade.
Conclusions
Our data reveals distinct TP profile differences between valve models. If verifiable, the design of future valves may utilize currently available experimental tools to determine TPs resulting in advanced devices with significantly reduced TP.","/content/10.1101/19009407v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009407v2.full.pdf","2019-11-18","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Behavioral effects of multiple-dose oxytocin treatment in autism: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial with long-term follow-up","Background
Intranasal administration of the prosocial neuropeptide oxytocin is increasingly explored as a potential treatment for targeting the core characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, long-term follow-up studies, evaluating the possibility of long-lasting retention effects are currently lacking. 
Methods
Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of four weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after four weeks of treatment (approximately 24 hours after the last nasal spray administration), and at two follow-up sessions, four weeks and one year post-treatment.
Results
No treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social symptoms (Social responsiveness scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (p= .37). Also informant-rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: p= .19). 
Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in self-reported repetitive behaviours (p= .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance towards others (p= .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to one month and even one year post-treatment. Treatment-specific effects were also revealed in screenings of mood states (Profile of Mood States), indicating higher reports of vigor (feeling energetic, active, lively) in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (p= .03). 
Conclusions
While no treatment-specific improvements were evident in terms of core social symptoms, the current observations of long-term beneficial effects on repetitive behaviors and feelings of avoidance are promising and suggestive of a therapeutic potential of oxytocin treatment for ASD. However, given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, future studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of OT administration further.","/content/10.1101/19012112v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012112v1.full.pdf","2019-11-18","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Post-discharge Acute Care and Outcomes in the Era of Readmission Reduction: A National Retrospective Cohort Study of Medicare Beneficiaries in the United States","Background: With incentives to reduce readmission rates in the United States, there are concerns that patients who need hospitalization after a recent hospital discharge may be denied access, which would increase their risk of mortality.

Objective: We determined whether patients with hospitalizations for conditions covered by national readmission programs who received care in emergency department (ED) or observation units but were not hospitalized within 30 days had an increased risk of death. We also evaluated temporal trends in post-discharge acute care utilization in inpatient units, emergency department (ED) and observation units for these patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants: In this observational study of national Medicare claims data for 2008-2016, we identified patients 65 years of age and older hospitalized with heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or pneumonia, conditions included in the HRRP.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Post-discharge 30-day mortality according to patients' 30-day acute care utilization. Acute care utilization in inpatient and observation units, and the ED during the 30-day and 31-90-day post-discharge period. 

Results: There were 3,772,924 hospitalizations for HF, 1,570,113 for AMI, and 3,131,162 for pneumonia. The overall post-discharge 30-day mortality was 8.7% for HF, 7.3% for AMI, and 8.4% for pneumonia. Risk-adjusted mortality increased annually by 0.05% (95% CI, 0.02% to 0.08%) for HF, decreased by 0.06% (95% CI, -0.09% to -0.04%) for AMI, and did not significantly change for pneumonia. Specifically, mortality increased for HF patients who did not utilize any post-discharge acute care, increasing at a rate of 0.08% per year (95% CI, 0.05% to 0.12%), exceeding the overall absolute annual increase in post-discharge mortality in heart failure, without an increase in mortality in observation units or the ED. Concurrent with a reduction in 30-day readmission rates, 30-day observation stays and visits to the ED increased across all 3 conditions during and beyond the post-discharge 30-day period. There was no significant change in overall 30-day post-acute care utilization.

Conclusions: The only condition with an increasing mortality through the study period was HF; the increase preceded the policy and was not present among those received ED or observation unit care without hospitalization. Overall, during this period, there was not a significant change in the overall 30-day post-discharge acute care utilization.","/content/10.1101/19002162v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002162v2.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Health Policy

"Semantic computational analysis of anticoagulation use in atrial fibrillation from real world data","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and significantly increases stroke risk. This risk is effectively managed by oral anticoagulation. Recent studies using national registry data indicate increased use of anticoagulation resulting from changes in guidelines and the availability of newer drugs. 
The aim of this study is to develop and validate an open source risk scoring pipeline for free-text electronic health record data using natural language processing. 
AF patients discharged from 1st January 2011 to 1st October 2017 were identified from discharge summaries (N=10,030, 64.6% male, average age 75.3 Â± 12.3 years). A natural language processing pipeline was developed to identify risk factors in clinical text and calculate risk for ischaemic stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc) and bleeding (HAS-BLED). Scores were validated vs two independent experts for 40 patients.
Automatic risk scores were in strong agreement with the two independent experts for CHA2DS2-VASc (average kappa 0.78 vs experts, compared to 0.85 between experts). Agreement was lower for HAS-BLED (average kappa 0.54 vs experts, compared to 0.74 between experts).
In high-risk patients (CHA2DS2-VASc >2) OAC use has increased significantly over the last 7 years, driven by the availability of DOACs and the transitioning of patients from AP medication alone to OAC. Factors independently associated with OAC use included components of the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores as well as discharging specialty and frailty. OAC use was highest in patients discharged under cardiology (69%).
Electronic health record text can be used for automatic calculation of clinical risk scores at scale. Open source tools are available today for this task but require further validation. Analysis of routinely-collected EHR data can replicate findings from large-scale curated registries.","/content/10.1101/19011643v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011643v2.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Health Informatics

In addition, stress has been demonstrated to have a negative impact the driving abilities of the general population, increasing the number of driving errors. However, to date no studies have explored stress and its potential impact on non-clinical performance of paramedics, particularly their driving abilities.


Methods
Paramedic students underwent emergency driving assessment in a driving simulator before and after exposure to a stressful medical scenario. Number and type of errors were documented before and after by both driving simulator software and observation by two observers from the research team. The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) was utilised to record self-reported stress levels.

Results
36 students participated in the study. Following exposure to a stressful medical scenario, paramedic students demonstrated no increase in overall error rate, but demonstrated an increase in three critical driving errors, namely failure to wear a seatbelt (3 baseline v 10 post stress), failing to stop for red lights or stop signs (7 v 35), and losing control of the vehicle (2 v 11). Self-reported stress levels also increased after the clinical scenario, particularly in the area of mental (cognitive) demand.

Conclusion
Paramedics are routinely exposed to acute stress in their everyday work, and this stress could affect their non-clinical performance. The critical errors committed by participants in this study closely matched those considered to be contributory factors in many ambulance collisions. These results stimulate the need for further research into the effects of stress on non-clinical performance in general, and highlight the potential need to consider additional driver training and stress management education in order to mitigate the frequency and severity of driving errors.","/content/10.1101/19003491v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003491v3.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Digitising point of care HIV test results to accurately measure, and improve performance towards, the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets","Introduction:
High rates of pre-treatment loss to care among persons diagnosed with HIV persist. Linkage to care can be improved through active digitally-based surveillance. Currently, record-keeping for HIV diagnoses in South Africa is paper-based. Aggregated testing data are reported routinely, and only discordant findings result in a specimen being tested at a laboratory and digitised. 
Methods:
The Western Cape Province in South Africa has a Provincial Health Data Centre (PHDC) where person-level routine data are consolidated in a single database, leveraging the existence of a unique patient identifier. To facilitate improved surveillance, a pre-carbonated point-of-care test (PoCT) form was piloted, where one copy was routed to the centralised laboratory and digitised for PHDC inclusion. We evaluated the utility of the intervention using cross-sectional and retrospective cohort analyses, as well as comparisons with reported aggregate data.
Results:
From May 2017 to June 2018, 11337 digitised point-of-care HIV testing records were linked to the PHDC. Overall, 96% of records in the aggregate dataset were digitised, with 97% linked to the PHDC. Of those tested, 79% were female (median age 27 years). Linkage demonstrated that 51.3% of patients testing HIV-positive were retesting. Of those truly newly diagnosed, 81% were linked to HIV care and 25% were initiated on antiretroviral therapy immediately.
Conclusion:
Digitisation of PoCT results is feasible and provides individuated HIV testing data to assist in linkage to care and in differentiating newly diagnosed patients from positive patients retesting. Actionable and accurate data can improve the measurement of performance towards the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets.","/content/10.1101/19012302v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012302v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","HIV/AIDS

"Prevalence and associated occupational factors for low back pain among the bank employees in Dhaka City","Objective:  Low Back Pain (LBP) is one of the common health problems among full-time office employees that causes employees absenteeism from work.  The purpose of the study is to identify the association between occupational factors and LBP among full-time bank employees in Dhaka City.
Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 593 full-time bank employees. The one-month complaints of LBP were administered by a musculoskeletal subscale of subjective health complaints by Eriksen et al. A logistic model was performed to identify variables associated with LBP, and a random forest technique was performed to identify the top 5 important variables.
Results: The one-month prevalence for LBP was found 36.6% among the bank employees and the prevalence was high (46.6%) for the 41 to 59-year-old age-group.  The multiple logistic regression analysis indicates that age (41-59 years) (OR:2.11, CI=1.21-3.74), obesity (OR:2.06, CI=1.01-4.21) and long working hours (>9 hours) (OR:1.42, CI=1.01-2.0) are positively associated with LBP.  Age and length of employment have a positive correlation of 0.87. The random forest technique identifies the top 5 important variables are, age, length of employment, long office hours, presence of chronic illness, and physical activity.  
Conclusion: LBP is highly prevalent in full-time bank employees.  The occupational factors like length of employment (>10 years) and long working hours (>9 hours) play a significant role in developing LBP among the bank employees. Moreover, the factors like age, chronic illness, obesity and physical activity should be taken into account in the prevention of LBP in bank employees.

"A Query Taxonomy Describes Performance of Patient-Level Retrieval from Electronic Health Record Data","Performance of systems used for patient cohort identification with electronic health record (EHR) data is not well-characterized. The objective of this research was to evaluate factors that might affect information retrieval (IR) methods and to investigate the interplay between commonly used IR approaches and the characteristics of the cohort definition structure.

We used an IR test collection containing 56 test patient cohort definitions, 100,000 patient records originating from an academic medical institution EHR data warehouse, and automated word-base query tasks, varying four parameters. Performance was measured using B-Pref. We then designed 59 taxonomy characteristics to classify the structure of the 56 topics. In addition, six topic complexity measures were derived from these characteristics for further evaluation using a beta regression simulation.

We did not find a strong association between the 59 taxonomy characteristics and patient retrieval performance, but we did find strong performance associations with the six topic complexity measures created from these characteristics, and interactions between these measures and the automated query parameter settings.

Some of the characteristics derived from a query taxonomy could lead to improved selection of approaches based on the structure of the topic of interest. Insights gained here will help guide future work to develop new methods for patient-level cohort discovery with EHR data.","/content/10.1101/19012294v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012294v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Health Informatics

"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in ÃŸ-thalassemia patients in Pakistan: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Objective: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most commonly reported bloodborne infection in Pakistan. Frequent blood transfusions in ÃŸ-thalassemia patients expose them to a high risk of HCV infection. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the current data on the prevalence of HCV infection among ÃŸ-thalassemia patients in Pakistan by using a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. 
Participants: ÃŸ-thalassemia patients in Pakistan.
Data sources: Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search in PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify published articles reporting on the prevalence of HCV among ÃŸ-thalassemia patients in Pakistan. Only English language articles were considered. Two independent authors selected studies. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies.
Results: The search conceded a total of 138 studies, of which 27 studies were finally considered for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of HCV in ÃŸ-thalassemia patients in Pakistan was 36.21% (95% CI: 28.98-43.75%) based on 5,789 ÃŸ-thalassemia patients, but there was considerable heterogeneity. Meta-analysis estimated the HCV prevalence among the ÃŸ-thalassemia patients at 45.98 % (95% CI: 38.15-53.90%) in Punjab, 31.81% (95% CI: 20.27-44.59%) in Sindh, and 28.04% (95% CI: 13.58-45.26%) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Meta-regression analysis showed that geographical location was a key source of heterogeneity.
Conclusions: The pooled prevalence of hepatitis C virus among ÃŸ-thalassemia patients in Pakistan was 36.21%, but varies regionally within the country. The prevalence is higher than in neighboring countries. With the use of standard prevention procedures during blood transfusion, the risk of HCV transmission among ÃŸ-thalassemia patients could be controlled hence prevalence of HCV in ÃŸ-thalassemia patients could be reduced.","/content/10.1101/19011973v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011973v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Hematology

"Evidence linking atopy and staphylococcal superantigens to the pathogenesis of lymphomatoid papulosis, a recurrent CD30+ cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorder","Background: Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a self-healing CD30+ cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorder (CLPD) with paradoxical histology of a malignant lymphoma. Case reports and small patient series suggest an association of LyP with atopy. However, the prevalence of atopy depends on patient recall which is not always reliable. More objective criteria of atopy include skin reactivity to allergens and IgE reactivity to allergens. This study was undertaken to determine if atopy is prevalent in LyP patients using IgE specific antibodies to aeroallergens, and if Staphylococcal aureus enterotoxins might be a pathogenic factors for LyP as proposed for other skin disorders. 
Methods: Thirty-one samples of  patients with CD30+ CLPD were tested for total serum IgE (IgE-t) and 10 IgE-specific airborne allergens with the Phadiatop multiallergen test, which if positive, is regarded as evidence of atopy. Sera was tested for IgE reactive against three Staphylococcal enterotoxins with superantigenic properties (SSAg-IgE). Control sera were obtained from adult subjects evaluated for rhino-sinusitis and a negative Phadiatop test. Patient history of atopy was obtained by retrospective chart review.
Findings: Nearly 50% of LyP patients had a positive Phadiatop test and IgE-t was increased compared to non-atopic controls. Seven of 28 (25%) LyP patients had at least one SSAg-IgE at the concentration used to define serologic atopy (0.35 kUa/L) compared to 3/52 (6%) controls (P= 0.028). TSST1-IgE was detected in 7 (23%) specimens of CD30CLPD, often together with SEB-IgE; SEA-IgE was not detected. TSST1-IgE exceeded the 0.35 kUa/L threshold in 3 (6%) controls. 
Conclusions: LyP patients have an increased prevalence of atopy as determined by the Phadiatop test and increased prevalence of SSAg-IgE compared to controls. Prevalence of serologic atopy exceeded that reported by patient medical history. The results support the hypothesis that an atopic diathesis and possibly SSAg contribute to the pathogenesis of LyP.","/content/10.1101/19012088v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012088v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Allergy and Immunology

"Pre-season screening currently has no value for injury prediction: The development and internal validation of a multivariable prognostic model to predict indirect muscle injury risk in elite football (soccer) players.","Background: In elite football (soccer), periodic health examination (PHE) could provide prognostic factors to predict injury risk.

Objective: To develop and internally validate a prognostic model to predict individual indirect (non-contact) muscle injury (IMI) risk during a season in elite footballers, only using PHE-derived candidate prognostic factors. 

Methods: Routinely collected preseason PHE and injury data were used from 119 players over 5 seasons (1st July 2013 to 19th May 2018). Ten candidate prognostic factors (12 parameters) were included in model development. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing values. The outcome was any time-loss, index indirect muscle injury (I-IMI) affecting the lower extremity. A full logistic regression model was fitted, and a parsimonious model developed using backward-selection to remove non-significant factors.  Predictive performance was assessed through calibration, discrimination and decision-curve analysis, averaged across all imputed datasets. The model was internally validated using bootstrapping and adjusted for overfitting.

Results: During 317 participant-seasons, 138 I-IMIs were recorded. The parsimonious model included only age and frequency of previous IMIs; apparent calibration was perfect but discrimination was modest (C-index = 0.641, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.580 to 0.703), with clinical utility evident between risk thresholds of 37-71%. After validation and overfitting adjustment, performance deteriorated (C-index = 0.580; calibration-in-the-large = -0.031, calibration slope =0.663).

Conclusion: The selected PHE data were insufficient prognostic factors from which to develop a useful model for predicting IMI risk in elite footballers. Further research should prioritise identifying novel prognostic factors to improve future risk prediction models in this field.","/content/10.1101/19012054v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012054v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Sports Medicine

"Rapid identification of genomic structural variations with nanopore sequencing enables blood-based cancer monitoring","Somatic genomic structural variations (SVs) are promising personalized biomarkers for sensitive and specific detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in liquid biopsies. However, affordable and fast identification of such SV biomarkers is challenging, which hinders routine use in the clinic. Here, we developed a novel approach - termed SHARC - for rapid discovery of somatic SVs as personalized tumor biomarkers. SHARC combines low coverage cancer genome sketching by using Oxford Nanopore sequencing with random forest classification and a dedicated filtering pipeline to enrich for somatic SVs. Our method leverages the real-time and long-read capabilities of nanopore sequencing to identify somatic SV breakpoints at nucleotide resolution from a tumor tissue biopsy within three days. We applied SHARC to tumor samples of high-grade ovarian and prostate cancer and validated on average ten somatic SVs per sample with PCR mini-amplicons. An accompanying method for SV breakpoint detection from liquid biopsies was devised based on digital PCR, enabling detection of cancer in a quantitative manner. Using this method, we retrospectively monitored treatment response in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Our work demonstrates that SHARC forms a universal framework for rapid development of personalized biomarker assays for blood-based monitoring of any cancer type.","/content/10.1101/19011932v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011932v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Genome-wide association study of Buruli ulcer in rural Benin","Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is the third mycobacterial disease worldwide characterized by devastating necrotizing skin lesions. The role of host genetics in susceptibility to Buruli ulcer has long been suggested. We conduct the first genome-wide association study of Buruli ulcer on a combined sample of 1,524 well characterized patients and controls from rural Benin. Two-stage analyses identify two novel associated loci located within lincRNA genes: rs9814705 in ENSG00000240095.1 (P = 2.85x10-7; odds ratio = 1.80 [1.43-2.27]), and rs76647377 in LINC01622 (P = 9.85x10-8; hazard ratio = 0.41 [0.28-0.60]). Furthermore, we replicate the protective effect of allele G of a missense variant located in ATG16L1, and previously shown to decrease bacterial autophagy (rs2241880, P = 0.003; odds ratio = 0.31 [0.14-0.68]). Our results suggest lincRNAs and the autophagy pathway as critical factors in the development of Buruli ulcer.","/content/10.1101/19012096v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012096v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Dengue Epidemiology in a Brazilian Community","We carried out an epidemiological study of the notified and confirmed cases of dengue, from 2000 to 2005, in Guarulhos, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A statistical analysis was performed to test the differences, by sex and age, between the database and the individuals of the population. We also performed a time series analysis of the cases from 2000 to April 2007. No statistically significant differences (P>0.05) were observed between the proportions for each sex in the data base and in the city population, and in the categories of 15-19 years, 20-24 years, 25-29 years, 55-59 years, 60-64 years and 70-74 years when compared with the corresponding age intervals in the population. In the other age intervals, statistically significant differences were observed (P<0.05). We observed a cyclic variation in the dengue incidence, between 2000 and April 2007, with an alternation of two years with a lower number of cases (2000-2001 and 2004-2005) and two years with a higher number of cases (2002-2003 and 2006-2007). In the seasonality analysis, the number of cases between February and May was higher than the monthly average. Analyzing the spatial distribution of the cases, we observed the process of increasing endemicity of dengue.","/content/10.1101/19011965v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011965v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Epidemiology

"Mitochondrial DNA copy number and incident heart failure: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study","Background: The association between mitochondrial DNA-copy number (mtDNA-CN) and incident heart failure (HF) in the general population is unclear.
Methods: We examined the association between mtDNA-CN and the risk of incident HF among 10,802 participants free of HF at baseline from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a large bi-racial population-based cohort. mtDNA-CN was estimated using probe intensities on the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human single nucleotide polymorphisms Array 6.0. Incident HF events were identified through hospital discharge codes from 1987 until 2005 and through adjudication by the ARIC HF Classification Committee since 2005.
Results: During a median follow-up of 23.1 years, there were 2,227 incident HF events (incidence rate 10.3 per 1000 person-years). In fully adjusted models, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for HF comparing the 2nd through 5th quintiles of mtDNA-CN to the 1st quintile were 0.91 (0.80â€“1.04), 0.82 (0.72â€“0.93), 0.81 (0.71â€“0.92), and 0.74 (0.65â€“0.85), respectively (P for trend < 0.001). In stratified analyses, the associations between mtDNA-CN and HF were similar across examined subgroups. The inverse association between mtDNA-CN and incident HF was stronger in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) than in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). 
Conclusions: In this prospective cohort, mtDNA-CN was inversely associated with the risk of incident HF suggesting that reduced levels of mtDNA-CN, a biomarker of mitochondrial dysfunction, could reflect early susceptibility to HF.","/content/10.1101/19012013v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012013v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Common variants in Alzheimer's disease: Novel association of six genetic variants with AD and risk stratification by polygenic risk scores","BACKGROUND: Disentangling the genetic constellation underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important. Doing so allows us to identify biological pathways underlying AD, point towards novel drug targets and use the variants for individualised risk predictions in disease modifying or prevention trials. In the present work we report on the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AD risk to date and show the combined utility of proven AD loci for precision medicine using polygenic risk scores (PRS).
METHODS: Three sets of summary statistics were included in our meta-GWAS of AD: an Spanish case-control study (GR@ACE/DEGESCO study, n = 12,386), the case-control study of International Genomics of Alzheimer project (IGAP, n = 82,771) and the UK Biobank (UKB) AD-by-proxy case-control study (n=314,278). Using these resources, we performed a fixed-effects inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. Detected loci were confirmed in a replication study of 19,089 AD cases and 39,101 controls from 16 European-ancestry cohorts not previously used. We constructed a weighted PRS based on the 39 AD variants. PRS were generated by multiplying the genotype dosage of each risk allele for each variant by its respective weight, and then summing across all variants. We first validated it for AD in independent data (assessing effects of sub-threshold signal, diagnostic certainty, age at onset and sex) and tested its effect on risk (odds for disease) and age at onset in the GR@ACE/DEGESCO study.
FINDINGS: Using our meta-GWAS approach and follow-up analysis, we identified novel genome-wide significant associations of six genetic variants with AD risk (rs72835061-CHRNE, rs2154481-APP, rs876461-PRKD3/NDUFAF7, rs3935877-PLCG2 and two missense variants: rs34173062/rs34674752 in SHARPIN gene) and confirmed a stop codon mutation in the IL34 gene increasing the risk of AD (IL34-Tyr213Ter), and two other variants in PLCG2 and HS3ST1 regions. This brings the total number of genetic variants associated with AD to 39 (excluding APOE). The PRS based on these variants was associated with AD in an independent clinical AD-case control dataset (OR=1.30, per 1-SD increase in the PRS, 95%CI 1.18-1.44, p = 1.1x10-7), a similar effect to that in the GR@ACE/DEGESCO (OR=1.27, 95%CI 1.23-1.32, p = 7.4x10-39). We then explored the combined effects of these 39 variants in a PRS for AD risk and age-at-onset stratification in GR@ACE/DEGESCO. Excluding APOE, we observed a gradual risk increase over the 2% tiles; when comparing the extremes, those with the 2% highest risk had a 2.98-fold (95% CI 2.12-4.18, p = 3.2x10-10) increased risk compared to those with the 2% lowest risk (p = 5.9x10-10). Using the PRS we identified APOE e33 carriers with a similar risk as APOE e4 heterozygotes carriers, as well as APOE e4 heterozygote carriers with a similar risk as APOE e4 homozygote. Considering age at onset; there was a 9-year difference between median onset of AD the lowest risk group and the highest risk group (82 vs 73 years; p = 1.6x10-6); a 4-year median onset difference (81 vs 77 years; p = 6.9x10-5) within APOE e4 heterozygotes and a 5.5-year median onset difference (78.5 vs 73 years; p = 4.6x10-5) within APOE e4 carriers.
INTERPRETATION: We identified six novel genetic variants associated with AD-risk, among which one common APP variant. A PRS of all genetic loci reported to date could be a robust tool to predict the risk and age at onset of AD, beyond APOE alone. These properties make PRS instrumental in selecting individuals at risk in order to apply preventative strategies and might have potential use in diagnostic work-up.","/content/10.1101/19012021v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012021v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"The efficacy of DNA MMR enzyme immunohistochemistry as a screening test for hypermutated gliomas","A subset of gliomas has DNA repair defects that lead to hypermutated genomes. While such tumors are resistant to alkylating chemotherapies, they may also express more mutant neoantigens on their cell surfaces, and thus be more responsive to immunotherapies. A fast, inexpensive method of screening for hypermutated gliomas would therefore be of great clinical value. Since immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins Msh2, Msh6, Mlh1, and Pms2 is already used to screen for hypermutated colorectal cancers, we sought to determine whether that panel might have similar utility in gliomas. MMR IHC was scored in 100 WHO grade I-IV gliomas with known tumor mutation burdens (TMB), while blinded to TMB data. Eight of 100 cases showed loss of one or more MMR proteins by IHC, and all 8 were hypermutated. Among the remaining 94 gliomas with intact MMR IHC, only one was hypermutated; that tumor had an inactivating mutation in another DNA repair gene, ATM. Overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 99%, 89%, and 100%, respectively. The strongest correlates with hypermutation were prior TMZ treatment, MGMT promoter methylation, and IDH1 mutation. Among MMR-deficient hypermutated gliomas, 50% contained both MMR-lost and MMR-retained tumor cells. Together, these data suggest that MMR IHC could be a viable front-line screening test for gliomas in which immunotherapy is being considered. They also suggest that not all cells in a hypermutated glioma may actually be MMR-deficient, a finding that might need to be considered when treating such tumors with immunotherapies.","/content/10.1101/19012005v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012005v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Pathology

"Genetic variation near CXCL12 is associated with susceptibility to HIV-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma","Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with a substantially increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). High plasma viral load, low CD4+ T cell counts and absence of antiretroviral treatment (ART) are known predictive factors for NHL. Even in the era of suppressive ART, HIV-infected individuals remain at increased risk of developing NHL compared to the general population. To search for human genetic determinants of HIV-associated NHL, we performed case-control genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in three cohorts of HIV+ patients of European ancestry and meta-analyzed the results. In total, 278 cases and 1924 matched controls were included. We observed a significant association with NHL susceptibility in the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) region on chromosome 10. A fine mapping analysis identified rs7919208 as the most likely causal variant (P = 4.77e-11). The G>A polymorphism creates a new transcription factor binding site for BATF and JUND. Analyses of topologically associating domains and promoter capture Hi-C data revealed significant interactions between the rs7919208 region and the promoter of CXCL12, also known as stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1). These results suggest a modulatory role of CXCL12 regulation in the increased susceptibility to NHL observed in the HIV-infected population.","/content/10.1101/19011999v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011999v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Mutation prevalence tables for hereditary cancer derived from multi-gene panel testing","Purpose: Multi-gene panel testing for cancer predisposition mutations is becoming routine in clinical care. However, the gene content of panels offered by testing laboratories vary significantly, and data on mutation detection rates by gene and by panel is limited, causing confusion among clinicians on which test would be the most appropriate to order. Moreover, screening guidelines are not described in sufficient granularity to explain how differences in family, personal history, age, and other factors would affect the prevalence of finding a mutation in similar populations. The tool herein quantifies prevalence of mutations in hereditary cancer genes based on personalized clinical and demographic characteristics.
Methods: Using results from approximately 150,000 multi-gene panel tests conducted at Ambry Genetics, we built an interactive prevalence tool to explore how differences in ethnicity, age of onset, and personal and family history of different cancers affect the prevalence of pathogenic mutations in 31 cancer predisposition genes, across various clinically available hereditary cancer gene panels.
Results: Over 13,000 mutation carriers were identified in this high-risk population. Most of the cases were Non-Hispanic White (74%, n=109,537), but also provide an appreciable dataset for those identifying as Black (n=10,875), Ashkenazi Jewish (n=10,464), Hispanic (n=10,028), and Asian (n=7,090). The most prevalent cancer types were breast (50%), ovarian (6.6%), and colorectal (4.7%), which is expected based on genetic testing guidelines and clinician referral for testing.
Conclusion: The Hereditary Cancer Multi-Gene Panel Prevalence Tool presented here can be used to provide insight into the prevalence of mutations on a per-gene and per-multigene panel basis, while conditioning on multiple custom phenotypic variables to include race and cancer type. The tool can be found at https://www.ambrygen.com/prevalence-tool.","/content/10.1101/19011981v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011981v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"A wealth of opportunities: an ethnographic study on learning to deliver high-value, cost-conscious care.","Objective: Since physicians behaviour determines up to 80% of total healthcare expenditures, training residents to deliver high-value, cost-conscious care is essential. Residents acknowledge the importance of high-value, cost-conscious care-delivery, yet perceive training to be insufficient. We designed an observational study to gain insight into how the workplace setting relates to residents high-value, cost-conscious care-delivery.
Design: This ethnographic study builds on 175 hours of non-participant observations including informal interviews, 9 semi-structured interviews and document analysis. 
Setting: Department of obstetrics and gynaecology in an academic hospital in the Netherlands. 
Population or sample: 21 gynaecology residents.
Methods: Iterative analysis process of fieldnotes, interview transcripts and documents, including open-coding, thematic analysis and axial analysis by a multidisciplinary research team. 
Results: Residents rarely consider health care costs, and knowledge regarding costs is often absent.  Senior consultants guide residents while balancing benefits, risks and costs, with or without explicating their decision-making process. Identified learning opportunities are elaboration on questions raised concerning high-value, cost-conscious care, checking information about costs that are used in discussions about high-value, cost-conscious care, and having a more open and explicit discussion about high-value, cost-conscious care. 
Conclusion: Our study emphasizes that the opportunities and potential to train residents to deliver high-value, cost-conscious care in the workplace are present. The challenge resides in capitalizing on these opportunities. We suggest departments to consult external experts to facilitate discussions regarding high-value, cost-conscious care to contribute to informal learning and to create a workplace setting in which high-value, cost-conscious care-delivery is prioritized.

"IE-Map: A novel in-vivo atlas template of the human inner ear","Brain atlases and templates are core tools in scientific research with increasing importance also in clinical applications. Advances in neuroimaging  now allowed us to expand the atlas domain to the vestibular and auditory organ, the inner ear. In this study, we present IE-Map, an in-vivo template and atlas of all known substructures of the human labyrinth derived from multi-modal high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging data in a non-invasive manner (no contrast agent or radiation). We reconstructed a common template from 126 inner ears (63 normal subjects)  and annotated it with 94 established landmarks and semi-automatic segmentations. Quantitative substructure analysis revealed a correlation of labyrinth parameters with total intracranial volume. No effects of gender or laterality were found. We provide the validated templates, atlas segmentations, surface meshes and landmark annotations as open-access material, to provide neuroscience researchers and clinicians in neurology, neurosurgery, and otorhinolaryngology with a widely applicable tool for computational neuro-otology.","/content/10.1101/19011908v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011908v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Radiology and Imaging

"Early Intervention in preterm infants modulates LINE-1 promoter methylation and neurodevelopment","Background:
Early life adversity exposure impacts preterm infants neurodevelopment and early intervention protocols may modulate neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Neuronal genomes are plastic in response to environment and mobile genetic elements, including LINE-1 (L1), are source of brain genomic mosaicism. Maternal care during early life regulates L1 methylation and copy number variations (CNVs) in mice. Here, we sought to identify the effects of maternal care and positive multisensory stimulation (Early Intervention) on L1 methylation and neurodevelopment in preterm infants.
Methods:
Very preterm infants were randomized to receive Standard Care or Early Intervention. L1 methylation was measured at birth and at hospital discharge. At 12 months infants neurodevelopment was evaluated with the Griffiths Scales. L1 methylation and CNVs were measured in mouse brain areas at embryonic and postnatal stages.
Results:
We demonstrated that L1 is hypomethylated in preterm versus term infants at birth. Early Intervention contributes to restore L1 methylation and positively modulates neurodevelopment. We showed that L1 methylation is developmentally-regulated in mice, decreasing in early postnatal life stages, which turns into an increased L1 CNVs specifically in hippocampus and cortex. 
Conclusions:
Here we demonstrated that L1 dynamics can be modulated by Early Intervention, in parallel with ameliorated neurodevelopmental outcomes. We further identified a specific developmental window of the fetal mouse brain, sensitive to early life experience, in which L1 dynamics are fine-tuned contributing to shape the brain genomic landscape.","/content/10.1101/19011874v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011874v1.full.pdf","2019-11-15","Pediatrics

"Anterolateral entorhinal cortex thickness as a new biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer's disease","Introduction: Loss of entorhinal cortex (EC) layer II neurons represents the earliest AD lesion in the brain. Research suggests differing functional roles between two EC subregions, the anterolateral EC (aLEC) and the posteromedial EC (pMEC).
Methods: We use joint label fusion to obtain aLEC and pMEC cortical thickness measurements from serial MRI scans of 775 ADNI-1 participants (219 healthy; 380 MCI; 176 AD) and use linear mixed-effects models to analyze longitudinal associations between cortical thickness, disease status and cognitive measures.
Results:  Group status is reliability predicted by aLEC thickness, which also exhibits greater associations with cognitive outcomes than does pMEC thickness. Change in aLEC thickness is also associated with CSF amyloid and tau levels. 
Discussion: Thinning of aLEC is a sensitive structural biomarker that changes over short durations in the course of AD and tracks disease severity; it is a strong candidate biomarker for detection of early AD.","/content/10.1101/19011825v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011825v1.full.pdf","2019-11-14","Neurology

"Posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with alpha dysrhythmia across the visual cortex and the default mode network","Background: Anomalies in default mode network (DMN) activity and alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations have been independently observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent spatiotemporal analyses suggest that alpha oscillations support DMN functioning via inter-regional synchronization and sensory cortical inhibition. Therefore, we examined a unifying pathology of alpha deficits in the visual-cortex-DMN system in PTSD.
Methods: Patients with PTSD (N = 25) and two control groups - patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (N = 24) and healthy controls (N = 20) - underwent a standard eyes-open resting state (S-RS) and a modified resting state (M-RS) of passively viewing salient images (known to deactivate the DMN). High-density electroencephalogram (hdEEG) were recorded, from which intracortical alpha activity (power and connectivity/Granger causality) was extracted using the exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA).
Results: Patients with PTSD (vs. controls) demonstrated attenuated alpha power in the visual cortex and key hubs of the DMN (posterior cingulate cortex/PCC and medial prefrontal cortex/mPFC) at both states, the severity of which further correlated with hypervigilance symptoms. With increased visual input (at M-RS vs. S-RS), patients with PTSD further demonstrated reduced alpha-frequency directed connectivity within the DMN (PCC to mPFC) and, importantly, from the visual cortex (VC) to both DMN hubs (VC to PCC and VC to mPFC), linking alpha deficits in the two systems.
Conclusions: These interrelated alpha deficits align with DMN hypoactivity/hypoconnectivity, sensory disinhibition, and hypervigilance in PTSD, representing a unifying neural underpinning of these anomalies. The identification of visual-cortex-DMN alpha dysrhythmia in PTSD further presents a novel therapeutic target, promoting network-based intervention of neural oscillations.","/content/10.1101/19011841v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011841v1.full.pdf","2019-11-14","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) A1298C polymorphism and risk of lung cancer","Recent epidemiological studies have reported association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphisms and lung cancer. The aim of the present study to perform a meta-analysis of published studies to validate the association between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and risk of lung cancer. PubMed, Springer Link, Science Direct and Google Scholar databases were searched for eligible studies. Of the 78 initially identified studies, 11 case control studies with 5,996 patients and 7,404 healthy controls were finally included in the present meta-analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to assess the association, and all statistical analyses were performed using MIX software (version 1.7). No statistically significant associations were found between the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and lung cancer risk in the additive/ allele contrast, co-dominant/heterozygote, homozygote, dominant and recessive genetic models (C vs. A: OR=  0.95, 95% CI= 0.83-1.08; CC vs. AA: OR= 1.13, 95% CI= 0.83-1.5; AC vs. AA: OR= 0.86, 95% CI= 0.70-1.02; AC+CC vs. AA: OR= 0.89, 95% CI= 0.75-1.05; CC vs. AA+AC: OR= 1.20, 95% CI= 0.89-1.40). Significant heterogeneity between individual studies was evident in all five models. In conclusion, present meta-analysis results indicated that there is no significant association between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and risk of lung cancer.","/content/10.1101/19011593v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011593v1.full.pdf","2019-11-14","Epidemiology

"Factors associated with risk of developmental delay in preschool children in a setting with high rates of malnutrition: a cross-sectional analysis of data from the IHOPE study, Madagascar","Background: Madagascar has one of the highest rates of stunting and at-risk child development in the world:50% of Malagasy children have moderate to severe stunting. In 2016, a new 10 year National Nutrition Action Plan (PNAN III), supported by the World Bank, was initiated to help address stunting and developmental delay. PIVOT, a health care NGO operating in collaboration with the MOH, conducts a longitudinal study, the IHOPE, to assess the population level impact of their collaborative health system strengthening activities on the rural district of Ifanadiana in southeastern Madagascar. We report factors associated with risk to developmental delay in children ages 3 and 4 years old in Ifanadiana district in 2016. 
Methods: The household survey data are from a cross-sectional analysis of a one wave of panel data in 2016, at the time of the initiation of PNAN III. Women ages 15 to 49 were interviewed, using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) Early Child Development Indicator (ECDI) module, which includes questions for physical, socio-emotional, learning and literacy/numeracy domains. ECDI data were analyzed using standardized z scores for relative relationships.  We assessed 2 outcomes: at risk for delayed development compared to an international standard, and lower development than peers if ECDI z scores were <1 standard deviation below the international normed population and study mean, respectively. Covariates included demographics (maternal age, education level, household wealth, number of other children under 5 in the house), adult involvement (reading, singing, playing with child), household environment (number and type of childrens books or toys, whether child was left alone or in the care of another child <10 years), and child health (wasting, stunting, underweight, ill in last 4 weeks, vaccination status).  We included variables significant in  univariable analysis at an alpha of <0.1 in a multivariable model. We constructed the final models using backward stepwise regression on generalized linear models, clustered at the sampling level. 
Results: Of 432 children ages 3 and 4 years, 173 were at risk for delay compared to international norms and 68 children (16.0%) were considered lower-development compared to their peers. 50.5% of the children had moderate to severe stunting and 19.0% had severe stunting. Greater paternal engagement (OR 1.59(1.13, 2.21)) was associated with being at risk for delay based on ECDI z scores <-1 compared to international norms Factors associated with lower risk for delay included having some adult play with the child and  greater engagement from a non-parental adult.

Factors associated with low development compared to peers included: under age 5 in the household, having a teenaged mother (age <20 years--OR3.89 (1.32, 11.48)), and having an adult who recently took the child outside. Factors associated with less developmental risk included increased number of developmentally stimulating activities by someone other than a parent(OR 0.28(0.16, 0.50)), and primary child toys are found objects rather than store bought or homemade(OR 0.33 (0.14, 0.73)).
Discussion: In this setting of high malnutrition, stunting in children is not associated with lower-development compared to their peers, when adjusting for other factors. Families with teenaged mothers are more likely to have children with lower-development.  Non-parent adult involvement seems very relevant to child development in this setting. Further research in the IHOPE longitudinal study may help to clarify direction of association. Interventions targeting adolescent girls before they become parents may be of particular utility in this setting.","/content/10.1101/19011064v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011064v1.full.pdf","2019-11-14","Public and Global Health

"The role of IgM testing in the diagnosis and post-treatment follow-up of syphilis: a prospective cohort study","Objectives: The diagnosis of repeat syphilis and its follow-up remains challenging. We aimed to investigate if IgM testing may assist in the diagnosis of syphilis reinfection/relapse and its treatment follow-up.
Methods: Sera were collected from 120 individuals with a new diagnosis of syphilis (72 with repeat infections) and 30 syphilis negative controls during a cohort study investigating syphilis biomarkers conducted at a STI/HIV clinic in Antwerp, Belgium. Syphilis was diagnosed based on a simultaneous positive treponemal and non-treponemal assay result and/or positive serum PCR targeting polA. Specimens collected at visit of diagnosis, and 3 and 6 months post-treatment were tested by two enzyme immuno assays (EIAs), recomWell (Mikrogen; MI) and Euroimmun (EU), to detect anti-treponemal IgM. Baseline specimens were also tested for anti-treponemal IgM using a line immuno assay (LIA) recomLine (Mikrogen). Quantitative kinetic decay curves were constructed from the longitudinal quantitative EIA results.
Results: An overall sensitivity for the diagnosis of syphilis of 59.8 % (95 % confidence interval (CI): 50.3-68.7), 75.0 % (95 %(CI): 66.1-82.3) and 64.2 % (95 %(CI): 54.8-72.6) was obtained for the EU, MI EIAs, and MI LIA, respectively. When only considering repeat syphilis, the diagnostic sensitivity decreased to 45.7 % (95 %(CI): 33.9-58.0), 63.9 % (95 %(CI): 51.7-74.6) and 47.2 % (95 %(CI): 35.5-59.3), respectively. IgM seroreverted in most cases 6 months after treatment. Post-treatment IgM concentrations decreased 30 % faster for initial syphilis compared to repeat infection. The IgM EIAs and IgM LIA agreed from fairly to moderately (Cohen's kappa: 0.36 [EU EIA]; Cohen's kappa: 0.53 [MI EIA]; Cohen's kappa: 0.40 [MI LIA]) with the diagnosis of syphilis.
Conclusions: IgM detection was not a sensitive method to diagnose syphilis and was even poorer in the diagnosis of syphilis repeat infections, but might play a role in treatment follow-up.","/content/10.1101/19011148v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011148v1.full.pdf","2019-11-14","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Inferring the role of the microbiome on survival in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: causal modeling, timing, and classes of concomitant medications","The microbiome has been shown to affect the response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) in a small number of cancers. Here, we sought to more broadly survey cancers to identify those in which the microbiome will play a role using retrospective analyses. We created a causal model for the relationship between medications, the microbiome and ICI response and used it to guide the abstraction of electronic health records of 690 patients who received ICI therapy for advanced cancer. Medications associated with changes to the microbiome including antibiotics, corticosteroids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine receptor blockers, non-steroid anti-inflammatories and statins were abstracted. We tested the effect of medication timing on overall survival (OS) and evaluated the robustness of medication effects in each cancer. Finally, we compared the size of the effect observed for antibiotics classes to taxa correlated with ICI response and a literature review of culture-based antibiotic susceptibilities. Of the medications assessed, only antibiotics and corticosteroids significantly associated with lower OS. The hazard ratios (HRs) for antibiotics and corticosteroids were highest near the start of ICI treatment but remained significant when given prior to ICI. Antibiotics and corticosteroids remained significantly associated with OS even when controlling for multiple factors such as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, and stage. When grouping antibiotics by class, ÃŸ-lactams showed the strongest association with OS across all tested cancers. The timing and strength of these effects after controlling for confounding factors are consistent with role for the microbiome in response to ICIs.","/content/10.1101/19006429v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006429v2.full.pdf","2019-11-14","Oncology

"Efficient prediction of vitamin B deficiencies via machine-learning using routine blood test results in patients with intense psychiatric episode","Background: Vitamin B deficiency is common worldwide and may lead to psychiatric symptoms; however, vitamin B deficiency epidemiology in patients with intense psychiatric episode has rarely been examined. Moreover, vitamin deficiency testing is costly and time-consuming, which has hampered effectively ruling out vitamin deficiency-induced intense psychiatric symptoms. In this study, we aimed to clarify the epidemiology of these deficiencies and efficiently predict them using machine-learning models from patient characteristics and routine blood test results that can be obtained within one hour.
Methods: We reviewed 497 consecutive patients deemed to be at imminent risk of seriously harming themselves or others over 2 years in a single psychiatric tertiary-care center. Machine-learning models (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest) were trained to predict each deficiency from age, sex, and 29 routine blood test results gathered in the period from September 2015 to December 2016. The models were validated using a dataset collected from January 2017 through August 2017.
Results: We found that 112 (22.5%), 80 (16.1%), and 72 (14.5%) patients had vitamin B1, vitamin B12, and folate (vitamin B9) deficiency, respectively. Further, the machine-learning models were well generalized to predict deficiency in the future unseen data, especially using random forest; areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the validation dataset (i.e. the dataset not used for training the models) were 0.716, 0.599, and 0.796, respectively. The Gini importance of these vitamins provided further evidence of a relationship between these vitamins and the complete blood count, while also indicating a hitherto rarely considered, potential association between these vitamins and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).
Discussion: This study demonstrates that machine-learning can efficiently predict some vitamin deficiencies in patients with active psychiatric symptoms, based on the largest cohort to date with intense psychiatric episode. The prediction method may expedite risk stratification and clinical decision-making regarding whether replacement therapy should be prescribed. Further research includes validating its external generalizability in other clinical situations and clarify whether interventions based on this method could improve patient care and cost-effectiveness.","/content/10.1101/19004317v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004317v2.full.pdf","2019-11-13","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Evaluation of Patient-Level Retrieval from Electronic Health Record Data for a Cohort Discovery Task","Objective

Growing numbers of academic medical centers offer patient cohort discovery tools to their researchers, yet the performance of systems for this use case is not well-understood. The objective of this research was to assess patient-level information retrieval (IR) methods using electronic health records (EHR) for different types of cohort definition retrieval.

Materials and Methods

We developed a test collection consisting of about 100,000 patient records and 56 test topics that characterized patient cohort requests for various clinical studies. Automated IR tasks using word-based approaches were performed, varying four different parameters for a total of 48 permutations, with performance measured using B-Pref. We subsequently created structured Boolean queries for the 56 topics for performance comparisons. In addition, we performed a more detailed analysis of 10 topics.

Results

The best-performing word-based automated query parameter settings achieved a mean B-Pref of 0.167 across all 56 topics. The way a topic was structured (topic representation) had the largest impact on performance. Performance not only varied widely across topics, but there was also a large variance in sensitivity to parameter settings across the topics. Structured queries generally performed better than automated queries on measures of recall and precision, but were still not able to recall all relevant patients found by the automated queries.

Conclusion

While word-based automated methods of cohort retrieval offer an attractive solution to the labor-intensive nature of this task currently used at many medical centers, we generally found suboptimal performance in those approaches, with better performance obtained from structured Boolean queries. Insights gained in this preliminary analysis will help guide future work to develop new methods for patient-level cohort discovery with EHR data.","/content/10.1101/19005280v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005280v2.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Health Informatics

"Re-evaluating the evidence for fecal microbiota transplantation ""super-donors"" in inflammatory bowel disease","Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a recommended treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, and there is promise that FMT may be effective for conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous FMT clinical trials have considered the possibility of a ""donor effect"", that is, that FMT material from different donors has different clinical efficacies. Here we lay out rigorous statistical methodology for detecting donor effects, finding that reliable detection of a donor effect requires trials with more than 200 FMT-treated patients. A re-evaluation of previous FMT clinical trials for IBD showed that while there is very little evidence for a non-zero donor effect, the existing data are also not inconsistent with substantial donor effects. Large-scale meta-analysis, combined with careful reporting from clinical trials, will be crucial in determining if donor effects are clinically relevant for IBD.","/content/10.1101/19011635v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011635v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Gastroenterology

"Urinary incontinence among pregnant women in Southern Brazil: a population-based cross-sectional survey","Background: Urinary incontinence (UI) is a frequent pathology that causes significant harm to the well-being and quality of life of pregnant women. This study aimed to measure the prevalence and to identify factors associated with the occurrence of UI during pregnancy in women living in the municipality of Rio Grande (RS), Southern Brazil, in 2016. Methods: This is a cross-sectional population-based study that included all puerperae living in this municipality who had a child in one of the two local maternity hospitals between January 1 and December 31, 2016. The interviews were held at the hospital within 48 hours after delivery, when previously trained interviewers used a single, standardized questionnaire, seeking information on maternal demographic, behavioral and reproductive/obstetric history, as well as socioeconomic status of the household and care received during pregnancy and childbirth. The multivariate analysis followed a previously defined hierarchical model, using Poisson regression with robust variance adjustment and prevalence ratio (PR) as measure of effect. Results: Among the 2,716 puerperae identified, 2,694 (99.2%) participated in this study. The prevalence of urinary incontinence in the gestational period was 14.7% (95%CI: 13.4%-16.1%). The lowest observed UI rate (8.3%) occurred among adolescent mothers (<20 years), while the highest occurred among those who reported frequent urinary urgency (39.2%). The probability of occurrence of UI, even after adjustment, was significantly higher among those who were older than 30 years old at current pregnancy, whose first pregnancy was before the age of 20 or after 30, who reached the end of gestation weighing 90 kg or more, who exercised regularly during pregnancy and who reported frequent urinary urgency during the gestational period. Conclusions: Urinary incontinence showed a high prevalence in the study population. The identified risk factors can be well administered at primary health care level. The recommendation of regular physical exercise in pregnancy must be reviewed and better investigated with more robust designs because of possible facilitators for the occurrence of UI in this period.

"Impact Of Electronic Health Record Interface Design On Unsafe Prescribing Of Ciclosporin, Tacrolimus and Diltiazem: A Cohort Study In English NHS Primary Care","Objectives: To assess variation by EHR system in breaches of safety guidance around prescribing of ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem; to conduct user-interface research into the causes of such breaches. 
Design: A retrospective cohort study.
Setting: Prescribing data in English primary care.
Participants: English general practices and their respective electronic health records.
Main outcome measures: The main outcome measures were (1) variation in ratio of breaching / adherent prescribing all practices (2) description of observations of EHR usage.
Results: A total of 2,575,411 prescriptions were issued in 2018 for ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem (over 60mg); of these, 316,119 prescriptions breached NHS guidance (12.3%). Breaches were most common amongst users of the EMIS EHR (in 23.2% of ciclosporin & tacrolimus prescriptions, and 22.7% of diltiazem prescriptions); but breaches were observed in all EHRs.
Conclusion: Design choices in EHR strongly influence safe prescribing of ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem; and breaches are prevalent in general practices in England. We recommend that all EHR vendors review their systems to increase safe prescribing of these medicines in line with national guidance. Almost all clinical practice is now mediated through an EHR system: further quantitative research into the effect of EHR design on clinical practice is long overdue.","/content/10.1101/19011957v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011957v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Health Informatics

"Estimating the causal effect of adiposity on carpal tunnel syndrome: a Mendelian randomization study","Background: We aimed to examine evidence for a causal effect of overall and abdominal adiposity on carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR).
Methods: The exposure included genetic instruments comprising independent variants associated with body mass index (BMI) (n=322,154), a proxy for overall adiposity, and waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) (n=210,082), a proxy for abdominal adiposity. Associations of these variants with CTS were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted in UK Biobank (12,312 CTS cases / 389,344 controls). Causal effects were estimated using inverse-variance weighted regression and conventional MR sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess for horizontal pleiotropy. In follow-up analyses we determined whether type 2 diabetes (T2D) or hyperlipidemia mediated the observed effects. 
Results: A 1-standard deviation (SD, ~4.7kg/m2) increase in genetically instrumented BMI increased the risk of CTS (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.48-2.02, p=2.68e-12), with consistent effects across sensitivity analyses. This effect translates to an absolute increase of 17 CTS cases per 1000 person years amongst US working populations [95% CI 11.0-23.5]. Univariable MR was consistent with a causal effect of T2D (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.11, p=5.20e-05), and the effect of BMI was partially attenuated (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.38-1.68, p=2.85e-08) when controlling for T2D liability in multivariable MR. In contrast, no effect was observed of WHRadjBMI on CTS (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.74-1.33, p=0.83). 
Conclusion: These data support a causal effect of overall adiposity on susceptibility to CTS that is only partially mediated through T2D, suggesting that efforts to reduce obesity may mitigate the population burden of CTS.","/content/10.1101/19011536v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011536v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Neurology

"Impact of dogs with deltamethrin-impregnated collars on prevalence of visceral leishmaniasis","Leishmaniasis is a vector borne zoonosis which is classified as a neglected tropical disease. Among the three most common forms of the disease, Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is the most threatening to human health, causing 20,000 to 30,000 deaths worldwide each year. Areas where VL is mostly endemic have unprotected dogs in community and houses. The presence of dogs usually increases VL risk for humans since dogs are the principal reservoir host for the parasite of the disease. Based on this fact, most earlier studies consider culling dogs as a control measure for the spread of VL. A more recent control measure has been the use of deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars (DIDCs) to protect both humans and dogs by putting DIDCs on dogs neck. The presence of dogs helps to grow the sandfly population faster by offering a more suitable blood-meal source. On the other hand, the presence of DIDCs on dogs helps to reduce sandfly population by the lethality of deltamethrin insecticide. This study brings an ecological perspective to this public health concern, aiming to understand the impact of an additional host (here, protected dogs) on disease risk to a primary host (here, humans). To answer this question, we compare two different settings: a community without dogs, and a community with dogs protected with DIDC. Our analysis shows the presence of protected dogs can reduce VL infection risk in humans. However, this disease risk reduction depends on dogs' tolerance for sandfly bites.","/content/10.1101/19011577v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011577v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Public and Global Health

"Prevalence of erectile dysfunction patients with diabetes mellitus and its association with body mass index and glycated hemoglobin in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Mortality and morbidity in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is attributed to both the micro vascular and macro vascular complications. Variation among primary studies was seen on the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in Africa. Therefore this study was aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of erectile dysfunction patients with diabetes mellitus and its association with body mass index and glycated hemoglobin in Africa.
Methods: PubMed Web of Science Cochrane library Scopus Psyinfo Africa online journal and Google Scholar were searched. A funnel plot and Egger s regression test were used to see publication bias. I squared statistic was used to check heterogeneity of studies. DerSimonian and Laird random effects model was applied to estimate the pooled effect size. The subgroup and Meta regression analysis were conducted by country sample size and year of publication. Sensitivity analysis was deployed to see the effect of single study on the overall estimation. STATA version 14 statistical software was used for meta analysis.
Result: A total of 20 studies with 5 177 study participants were included to estimate the pooled prevalence. The pooled prevalence of erectile dysfunction patients with diabetes mellitus was 61.62% (95% CI: 48.35, 74.9). BMI greater than or equal to 30kg/m2 (AOR = 1.26; 95% CI: 0.73, 2.16) and glycated hemoglobin greater than or equal to 7%(AOR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.5, 5.9) were identified factors though not statistically significant associated with erectile dysfunction. 
Conclusions: The prevalence of erectile dysfunction in Africa remains high. Therefore, situation based interventions and country context specific preventive strategies could be developed to reduce the magnitude of erectile dysfunction among patients with diabetes mellitus.

"Evaluation of the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program","Background: There is conflicting evidence about whether the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) is associated with an increase in mortality.
 
Methods: In a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with heart failure (HF), we compared two published approaches to evaluating the association of HRRP and risk-adjusted 30-day mortality, including changes in average mortality across periods and changes in slope of monthly mortality rates across discrete periods. We also tested various methods with simulated data that was designed with an inflection in mortality.

Results: We identified 4,313,523 hospitalizations for HF, 1,788,219 for AMI, and 3,758,111 for pneumonia. Monthly slope-change models identified an increase in mortality for HF and pneumonia in the pre-HRRP period (P<.001 for slope-change). The changes in average mortality across the four time periods model found an increase in mortality for HF and pneumonia in the HRRP anticipation period (post-announcement, pre-implementation) as well as following HRRP implementation. However, under those conditions, our simulations reveal that method errs in identifying the timing of a change. Varying the data sources and risk-adjustment strategies had no significant effect on the results.

Conclusion: A national policy incentivizing efforts to reduce readmission did not increase the risk of mortality.","/content/10.1101/19011734v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011734v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Health Policy

"One-week test-retest reliability of nine binocular tests and saccades used in concussion","Background: Tests of binocular vision (BVTs) and ocular motility are used in concussion assessment and management. 

Purpose: To determine the one-week test-retest reliability of 9 binocular vision tests (BVTs) and a test of saccades proposed for use in concussion management. 

Study Design: Prospective test-retest.

Methods: We examined the one-week test-retest reliability of 9 BVTs in healthy participants: 3D vision (gross stereoscopic acuity), phoria at 30cm and 3m, ability of eyes to move/fixate in-sync (positive and negative fusional vergence at 30cm and 3m, near point of convergence and near point of convergence-break [i.e. double vision]) and 1 ocular motor test, saccades. 

Results: We tested 10 males and 10 females without concussion and a mean age of 25.5 (4.1) years. The intraclass correlations suggest good reliability for phoria 3m (0.88) and gross stereoscopic acuity (0.86), and moderate reliability for phoria 30cm (0.69), near point of convergence (0.54), positive fusional vergence (0.54) and negative fusional vergence (0.66) at 30cm, and near point of convergence - break (0.64). There was poor reliability for saccades (0.34), and both positive and negative fusional vergence (0.49 and 0.43, respectively) at 3m. Limits of agreement (LoA) were best for saccade (34%) and worst for phoria 30 cm (121%) and ranged from 58% to 70% for 7 of the 8 other tests. The LoA for phoria at 3m were uninformative because measurements for 18 of 20 participants were identical. 

Conclusion: We found test-retest reliability of the BVTs and saccades ranging from poor to good in healthy participants, with the majority being moderate. 
Clinical Relevance: For these vision tests to be clinically useful, the effect of concussion must have a moderate to large effect on the scores of most of the tests.","/content/10.1101/19011619v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011619v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Sports Medicine

"Is There a Health Inequality in Gambling Related Harms? A Systematic Review","Objective: Here we present a systematic review of the existing research into gambling harms, in order to determine whether there are differences in the presentation of these across demographic groups such as age, gender, culture, and socioeconomic status, or gambling behaviour categories such as risk severity and play frequency.
Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures: Inclusion criteria were: 1) focus on gambling harms; 2) focus on harms to the gambler rather than affected others; 3) discussion of specific listed harms and not just harms in general terms. Exclusion criteria were: 1) not written in English; 2) not an empirical study (i.e. an editorial piece or letter); 3) not available as a full article.
Search: A systematic search was conducted using the Web of Science database in August 2019. Selected studies were assessed for quality using Standard Quality Assessment Criteria.
Results: Forty-Seven studies published between 2006 and 2019 met the inclusion criteria. These were categorised into thematic groups for comparison and discussion. There were replicated differences found in groups defined by age, risk severity and gambling behaviours. However, the majority of research regarding gender concluded that harm profiles were similar, or differences could be explained by confounding variables. 
Conclusion: Harms appear to be dependent on specific social, demographic and environmental conditions that suggests there is a health inequality in gambling related harms. Further investigation is required to develop standardised measurement tools and to understand confounding variables and co-morbidities. With a robust understanding of harms distribution in the population, Primary Care Workers will be better equipped to identify those who are at risk, or who are showing signs of Gambling Disorder, and to target prevention and intervention programmes appropriately.","/content/10.1101/19012104v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012104v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Evaluation of the concentration and profile of serum proteins and immunoglobulins in Mexican patients with advanced gastric cancer","Introduction: Gastric cancer remains an important health problem. Its molecular mechanisms and interactions with the immune system are still not well elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the concentration and profile of serum proteins and immunoglobulins in Mexican patients with advanced gastric cancer. Materials and methods: We performed a descriptive study. Adult patients from both sexes were included. The problem group was formed of patients with advanced gastric cancer and the control group was formed of healthy subjects. Demographic data, gastric cancer histological type and stage of tumor node metastasis (TNM) system were recorded. The profile and concentration of serum proteins and immunoglobulins was determined and analyzed in different subgroups classified by sex, histologic type and stage of TNM system. To compare the concentrations of serum proteins and immunoglobulins the ANOVA test was performed. A p <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: We included 88 patients with advanced gastric cancer and 74 healthy controls. There were no differences in demographic data among the groups, and the most common gastric cancer type was the diffuse (67.04%). Women with gastric cancer from any type presented higher levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) compared with the control group (p <0.001) and men with gastric cancer of intestinal type in TNM stage III presented higher levels of IgG compared with its counterpart of diffuse type (p <0.001). Also, patients with intestinal type gastric cancer presented higher concentrations of alpha-1 globulins compared with patients with the diffuse type (p <0.05). Finally, patients with diffuse gastric cancer TNM stage IV presented the lowest albumin/globulin ratios. Conclusion: There is a greater concentration of serum IgG in some subgroups of patients with advanced gastric cancer, the concentration of alpha-1 globulins is different between the intestinal and diffuse types and the albumin/globulin ratio is lower in the diffuse type.","/content/10.1101/19011759v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011759v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Oncology

"White Matter Alterations in Borderline Personality Disorder","Borderline personality disorder (BorPD) is characterized by instability and impulsivity of mood, relationships and self-image. This disease is an important area of public health policy; compared to other psychiatric disorders, individuals with BorPD experience the most severe functional impairments. Nevertheless, for the patients that do recover, this recovery is stable and only few relapse back to psychopathology. Given its high rate of remission, the rewards of effective treatment options are clear. Identification of underlying anatomical and physiological changes is crucial to refine current treatments and develop new ones. In this perspective, previous magnetic resonance imaging studies have highlighted alterations associated with BorPD phenotype. In particular, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has identified many white matter structural alterations in individuals with this diagnosis. Although in its infancy, limiting this line of investigation is a lack of direction at the field level. Hence, the present paper aims to conduct a meta-analysis of DWI findings in individuals with a diagnosis of BorPD, testing the hypothesis that there are specific white matter alterations associated with BorPD. To this end, we performed a meta-analysis of the existing literature of DWI in BorPD representing a total of 123 individuals with BorPD and 117 Controls. Our results indicated that individuals with BorPD show regions of reduced fractional anisotropy in the corpus callosum and fornix. These results survived all jack-knife reshuffles and showed no publication bias. This suggest that alterations in these structures may contribute to psychopathology. Further, the present results lend support to extant psychological and biological models of BorPD.","/content/10.1101/19011676v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011676v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"A pilot biomonitoring study of cumulative phthalates exposure among Vietnamese American nail salon workers","Background: Many California nail salon workers are low-income Vietnamese women of reproductive age who use nail products daily that contain androgen-disrupting phthalates which may increase risk of male reproductive tract abnormalities during pregnancy. Yet, few studies have characterized phthalate exposures among this workforce. Objective: To characterize individual metabolites and cumulative phthalates exposure among a potentially vulnerable occupational group of nail salon workers. Study Design: We collected 17 post-shift urine samples from Vietnamese workers at six San Francisco Bay Area nail salons in 2011, which were analyzed for four primary phthalate metabolites: mono-n-butyl-, mono-isobutyl-, mono(2-ethylhexyl)-, and monoethyl phthalates (MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MEP, respectively) (Âµg/L). Phthalate metabolite concentrations and a potency-weighted sum of parent compound daily intake (Sandrogen-disruptor, Âµg/kg/day) were compared to 203 Asian Americans from the 2011-12 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) using Student t-test and Wilcoxin signed rank test. Results: Creatinine-corrected MnBP, MiBP, MEHP (Âµg/g), and cumulative phthalates exposure (Sandrogen-disruptor, Âµg/kg/day) levels were 2.9 (p < 0.0001), 1.6 (p = 0.015), 2.6 (p < 0.0001), and 2.0 (p < 0.0001) times higher, respectively, in our nail salon worker population compared to NHANES Asian Americans. Levels exceeded the NHANES 95th or 75th percentiles among some workers. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that nail salon workers are disproportionately exposed to multiple phthalates, a finding that warrants further investigation to assess their potential health significance.","/content/10.1101/19011452v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011452v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Relation between Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase C677T and A1298C Polymorphisms and Migraine Susceptibility","Migraine is a neurological disorder which impairs the patients quality of life. Several association studies investigating the association between MTHFR gene C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and susceptibility to migraine were published. But the results were conflicting, so authors performed a meta-analysis of published case control studies. Four databases were searched for suitable studies up to December, 2018. Odds ratios (OR) with  95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated adopting additive, homozygote, co-dominant, dominant, and recessive genetic models. Results of MTHFR C677T polymorphism studies meta-analysis showed significant association with migraine risk using allele contrast, homozygote, dominant and recessive genetic models (T vs. C: OR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.00-1.26, p= 0.05; TT vs. CC: OR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.0-1.5, p= 0.04; CT vs. CC: OR = 1.08, 95%CI = 0.97-1.07, p= 0.25; TT+CT vs. CC: OR = 1.15, 95%CI = 1.0-1.29, p= 0.04; TT vs. CT +CC: OR = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.28-3.42, p= 0.002). However, results of MTHFR A1298 polymorphism studies meta-analysis did not show any association with migraine. Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity and migraine types i. e migraine with aura (MA) and without aura (MO) were also performed. Results of present meta-analysis indicate overall association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism with migraine in total 24 studies, in Asian population and in MA cases but did not show any association with Caucasian population and MO cases.","/content/10.1101/19011601v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011601v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Epidemiology

"Distinct single cell gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes correlates with treatment response groups defined by type I interferon in rheumatoid arthritis","Objective: Previously, we have shown that the ratio of IFNÃŸ/a activity can predict response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, our objective was to better understand the impact of this type I IFN ratio in monocytes from RA patients. 
Methods: We compared single cell gene expression in purified classical (CL) and non-classical (NC) monocytes from RA patients.  Patients with high vs. low serum IFNÃŸ/a ratio were compared to each other, as determined by functional type I IFN assay. 
Results: We found large differences in monocyte gene expression between patients with different IFNÃŸ/a ratios, which was apparent in principal component analysis.  Cluster analysis also documented strong differences between these response groups.  In CL monocytes, decreased expression of JAK1 and IFI27 were strongly associated with the non-response low IFNÃŸ/a ratio.  In NC monocytes, increased expression of HLADRB1, TNFA, PDL1, TGFB, and others were associated with the non-response IFN ratio.  Interestingly, JAK1 expression was absent in all monocytes from some patients.  This pattern was strongly associated with the non-response type I IFN ratio, suggesting a major biological difference between JAK1 expressors and non-expressors. 
Conclusions: Differences in the ratio of IFNÃŸ/a are associated with major changes in gene expression in RA patient monocytes, suggesting differential IFN pathway activation in RA patients who are either more or less likely to respond to TNFi.  This work could suggest mechanisms for TNFi non-response, as well as potential therapeutic strategies for those patients who would not to respond to TNFi.","/content/10.1101/19011460v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011460v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Rheumatology

"Transcranial random noise stimulation for the acute treatment of depression: a randomized-controlled trial","Background
Transcranial electrical stimulation has broad potential as a treatment for depression. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), which delivers randomly fluctuating current intensities, may have greater cortical excitatory effects compared to other forms of transcranial electrical stimulation. We therefore aimed to investigate the antidepressant efficacy of tRNS. 
Methods
Depressed participants were randomly assigned by computer number generator to receive 20 sessions of either active or sham tRNS over four weeks in a double-blinded, parallel group randomized-controlled trial. tRNS was delivered for 30mins with a direct current offset of 2mA and a random noise range of 2mA. Primary analyses assessed changes in depression severity using the Montgomery-Asperg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Neuroplasticity, neuropsychological, and safety outcomes were analysed as secondary measures. 
Results
69 participants were randomised, of which three discontinued treatment early leaving 66 (sham n = 34, active n = 32) for per-protocol analysis. Depression severity scores reduced in both groups (MADRS reduction in sham = 7.0 [95%CI 5.0-8.9]; and active = 5.2 [95%CI 3.2-7.3]). However, there were no differences between active and sham groups in the reduction of depressive symptoms, or the number of participants meeting response (sham = 14.7%; active = 3.1%) and remission criteria (sham = 5.9%; active = 0%). Erythema, paraesthesia, fatigue, and dizziness/light-headedness occurred more frequently in the active tRNS group. Neuroplasticity, neuropsychological and acute cognitive effects were comparable between groups.
Conclusion
Our results do not support the use of tRNS with the current stimulation parameters as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of depression.

"Impacts of lack of pocket money on undergraduate students' clinical learning activities","Background:
In Ethiopia, there is little understanding regarding student expenses in the governmental university and how the lack of pocket money affects undergraduate learning. This is particularly evident for undergraduate health sciences students that need additional money when they start their clinical placement. 
Objectives:
We aimed to explore the economic challenges that clinical year undergraduate health sciences students face with limited pocket money, as well as how students perceive these limited funds as affecting their learning activities and their ability to meet challenges.
Methods:
This descriptive qualitative study was conducted at the Department of Medical Radiology Technology (MRT), College of Health Sciences (CHS) at Addis Ababa University (AAU). Ten participants were recruited through purposive and snowball methods, and semi-structured interviews were conducted between January 28, 2019 and February 1, 2019. The semi-structured questions explored participant's experiences and perceptions regarding the challenges of a lack of pocket money and its impacts on their learning activities. Their reaction to financial challenges was also assessed.
Results:
Four themes that are related to impact of lack of money on learning activities emerged from the interviews and they revolved around student challenges in obtaining pocket money, their difficulty in affording daily needs, their self-management and their ability to have an adequate social life. 
Conclusion:
Based on our data, the underlying causes that lead students to face financial hardships can be solved by increasing public awareness of university expenses, clarifying the cost sharing system to the public, redesigning the cost sharing policy, and improving university services In addition, training students self-management and pocket money management, as well giving providing adequate transportation services, cash-money, and consultations for students during clinical placement.

"Machine learning-based imaging biomarkers improve statistical power in clinical trials","Radiomic models, which leverage complex imaging patterns and machine learning, are increasingly accurate in predicting patient response to treatment and clinical outcome on an individual patient basis. In this work, we show that this predictive power can be utilized in clinical trials to significantly increase statistical power to detect treatment effects or reduce the sample size required to achieve a given power. Akin to the historical control paradigm, we propose to utilize a radiomic prediction model to generate a pseudo-control sample for each individual in the trial of interest. We then incorporate these pseudo-controls into the analysis of the clinical trial of interest using classical and well established statistical tools, and investigate statistical power. Effectively, this approach utilizes each individual's radiomics-based predictor of outcome for comparison with the actual outcome, potentially increasing statistical power considerably, depending on the accuracy of the predictor. In simulations of treatment effects based on real radiomic predictive models from brain cancer and prodromal Alzheimer's Disease, we show that this methodology can decrease the required sample sizes by as much as a half, depending on the strength of the radiomic predictor. We further find that this method is most helpful when treatment effect sizes are small and that power grows with the accuracy of radiomic prediction.","/content/10.1101/19010041v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010041v2.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Radiology and Imaging

"Identification of non-small cell lung cancer subgroups with distinct immuno-therapy outcomes from integrating genomics and electronic health records on a graph convolutional network","Recently immuno-oncology (IO) therapies, especially checkpoint inhibitor therapies, have transformed the therapeutic landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, responses to IO in NSCLC are highly disparate because patients are heterogenous with a variety of genomic and clinical-phenotype complexity. Thus, there is a pressing need to discover and characterize NSCLC subgroups to advance precision immuno-oncology. However, this is a challenging task largely due to: 1) the study cohort is too small to investigate this heterogeneous disease; 2) the datasets used in subtyping studies are not comprehensive enough to incorporate both genomic data and diverse clinical-phenotype data with long-term follow-ups, and 3) the subtyping algorithms and models are ineffective in integrating high-dimensional data from both genomic and clinical domains. To address these challenges, we have developed a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) method to discover NSCLC complexity on IO treatment responses based on the high-dimensional electronic health records (EHR) and genomic data from 1,937 IO treated NSCLC patients. First, using Flatiron Health database, we identified a IO treated NSCLC cohort (n = 1,937), with genomic data from Foundation-Medicine targeted DNA deep-sequencing, clinical data from harmonized real-world EHR from 275 US oncology practices, and survival data after IO treatment with a median follow-up time of 6.61 months (average follow-up time 9.11 months). We then developed a GCN based artificial intelligence (AI) model to build a patient-patient similarity network from integrating both genomic and EHR data to discover novel NSCLC subgroups with dramatically different responses to IO therapies. We have demonstrated the performance of the GCN is superior to commonly used machine learning methods such as autoencoder, UMAP, and tSNE, and superior to utilizing genomic or clinical data alone. Importantly, we have successfully discovered the IO responsive (covers 20.27% of the cohort) and the IO non-responsive (45.46%) subgroups that demonstrate significant overall survival difference after IO treatments (9.42 vs. 20.35 months, p<0.0001). These two subgroups demonstrate enrichments of novel clinical phenotypes and genomic traits beyond well-known IO biomarkers of tumor mutation burden and PDL1 status, such as enrichment of abnormal blood Basophils and KRAS mutations in the responsive subgroup and the enrichment of low hemoglobin, low lymphocytes, PI3KCA amplifications, etc. in the non-responsive subgroup, suggesting distinct clinical and molecular underpinnings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ a graph-based AI approach to integrate both high-dimensional clinical and genomic features to investigate IO treatment responses in NSCLC. The new subtypes discovered in this work cast new lights on understanding the heterogeneity of IO treatment responses, and pave ways to inform clinical decision making for precision oncology of NSCLC.

"Genomic Epidemiology of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Two Cohorts of High-Risk Military Trainees","Background. MRSA skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) is a significant cause of morbidity in military trainees. To guide interventions, it is critical we understand the epidemiology of MRSA in this population.
Methods. Two cohorts (â€˜companiesâ€™) of US Army Infantry trainees (N=343) at Fort Benning, GA, USA, were followed during their training cycles (Jun.-Dec. 2015). Trainees had nares, oropharynx, perianal and inguinal areas swabbed for MRSA colonization at five ~2-4 week intervals, and monitored for SSTI throughout training. Epidemiological data were collected. Isolates were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq and NovaSeq. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms and clusters were identified. Multi-locus sequence type (MLST) and antimicrobial resistance genes were predicted from de novo assemblies. 
Results. 87 trainees were positive at least once for MRSA (12 had SSTI, 2 without any colonization). Excluding those positive at baseline, 43.7% were colonized within the first month of training. 244/254 samples were successfully sequenced (including all SSTI). ST8 (n=135, 100% of SSTI), ST5 (n=81) and ST87 (n=21) were the most represented. Three main Clusters were identified, largely corresponding to these STs. Sub-analyses within Clusters showed multiple importations of MRSA, with transmission subsequently predominantly within, rather than between, platoons in each company. Over 50% of trainees were colonized only at other anatomical sites; restricting analyses to nares missed substantial transmission. 
Conclusions. Serial importations of MRSA into this high-risk setting likely contribute to the ongoing burden of MRSA colonization and infection among military trainees. Sampling multiple anatomical sites is critical for comprehensive characterization of MRSA transmission.","/content/10.1101/19011445v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011445v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Epidemiology

"Motivational Strategies for Stroke Rehabilitation: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study","Background and Purpose: The addition of motivational strategies to a rehabilitation program is thought to enhance patient adherence and improve outcomes. However, little is known about how rehabilitation professionals motivate stroke patients during rehabilitation. The primary objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive and quantitative list of motivational strategies for stroke rehabilitation. In addition, we aimed to examine (1) whether professionals with more clinical experience used a higher number of motivational strategies, (2) the purpose for using each strategy, and (3) the information considered when choosing strategies.
Methods: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted using a web survey with a random sample of 407 rehabilitation professionals including physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language-hearing therapists. 
Results: We received data for 362 participants. Fifteen strategies were found to be used by more than 75% of the respondents reported using to motivate their patients. Almost all of the respondents reported that they actively listen to and praise their patients to increase patient adherence to rehabilitation programs. Respondents with more clinical experience tended to use a higher number of motivational strategies (rho = 0.208, p < 0.001). For 11 of the 15 strategies selected by more than 75% of respondents, the highest percentage of respondents reported that they used the strategies to make rehabilitation worthwhile for their patients. The majority of respondents reported that they decide which motivational strategy to use by considering comprehensive information regarding the patient health condition, environmental factors, and personal factors. 
Conclusions: The comprehensive list of motivational strategies obtained may be useful for increasing patient adherence to rehabilitation, especially for professionals with less clinical experience. Furthermore, our findings regarding the purpose for using each strategy and the information used to choose strategies might help rehabilitation professionals to utilize the motivational strategy list.","/content/10.1101/19011023v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011023v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Replicating Global Brain Connectivity as an Imaging Marker for Depression â€“ Influence of Preprocessing Strategies and Randomized Placebo-Controlled Ketamine Treatment","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with altered global brain connectivity (GBC), as assessed via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Previous studies found that antidepressant treatment with ketamine normalized aberrant GBC changes in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, warranting further investigations of GBC as a putative imaging marker. However, the results were only obtained via global signal regression (GSR). This study is an independent replication of that analysis using a separate dataset. GBC was analyzed in 28 individuals with MDD and 22 healthy controls (HCs) at baseline, post-placebo, and post-ketamine. To investigate the effects of preprocessing, three distinct pipelines were used: 1) regression of white matter (WM)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signals only (BASE); 2) WM/CSF+GSR (GSR); and 3) WM/CSF+physiological parameter regression (PHYSIO). Compared to PHYSIO and BASE regression, GSR reduced Fisher Z-scores (Fz-scores) in large clusters. PHYSIO did not resemble GBC preprocessed with GSR (GBCr). Reduced GBCr was observed in individuals with MDD at baseline in the anterior and medial cingulate cortices, as well as in the prefrontal cortex. Significant results were only found with GSR. Ketamine had no effect compared to baseline or placebo in either group. These results concur with several studies that used GSR to study GBC. Altered GBCr was observed in the cingulate and prefrontal cortices, but ketamine treatment had no effect. Further investigations are warranted into disease-specific components of global fMRI signals that may drive these results and of GBCr as a potential imaging marker in MDD.","/content/10.1101/19010504v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010504v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Identifying Acute Low Back Pain Episodes in Primary Care Practice from Clinical Notes","Acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) are different conditions with different treatments. However, they are coded in electronic health records with the same ICD-10 code (M54.5) and can be differentiated only by retrospective chart reviews. This prevents efficient definition of data driven guidelines for billing and therapy recommendations, such as return to-work options. To solve this issue, we evaluate the feasibility of automatically distinguishing acute LBP episodes by analyzing free text clinical notes. We used a dataset of 17,409 clinical notes from different primary care practices; of these, 891 documents were manually annotated as ""acute LBP"" and 2,973 were generally associated with LBP via the recorded ICD-10 code. We compared different supervised and unsupervised strategies for automated identification: keyword search; topic modeling; logistic regression with bag-of-n-grams and manual features; and deep learning (ConvNet). We trained the supervised models using either manual annotations or ICD-10 codes as positive labels. ConvNet trained using manual annotations obtained the best results with an AUC-ROC of 0.97 and F-score of 0.72. ConvNet's results were also robust to reduction of the number of manually annotated documents. In the absence of manual annotations, topic models performed better than methods trained using ICD-10 codes, which were unsatisfactory for identifying LBP acuity. This study uses clinical notes to delineate a potential path toward systematic learning of therapeutic strategies, billing guidelines, and management options for acute LBP at the point of care.","/content/10.1101/19010462v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010462v2.full.pdf","2019-11-11","Health Informatics

"Health Care Provider Compliance with the HIPAA Right of Individual Access: A Scorecard and Survey","Background: Historically, patients have had difficulty obtaining copies of their medical records, notwithstanding the legal right to do so. In 2018, a study of 83 top hospitals found discrepancies between those hospitals published information and telephone survey responses regarding their processes for release of records to patients, indicating noncompliance with the HIPAA right of individual access.

Objective: Assess state of compliance with the HIPAA right of access across a broader range of health care providers and in the context of real records requests from patients. 
 
Methods: Evaluate the degree of compliance with the HIPAA right of access 1) through telephone surveys of health care institutions regarding release of records to patients and 2) by scoring the responses of a total of 210 health care providers to actual patient record requests against the HIPAA right of access requirements. (51 of those providers were part of an initial cohort of 51 scored for an earlier version of this paper.)
 
Results: Based on the scores of responses of 210 health care providers to record requests and the responses of nearly 3000 healthcare institutions to telephone surveys, more than 50% of health care providers are out of compliance with the HIPAA right of access. The most common failure was refusal to send records to patient or patients designee in the form and format requested by the patient, with 86% of noncompliance due to this factor. The number of phone calls required to obtain records in compliance with HIPAA, and the lack of consistency in provider responses to actual requests, makes the records retrieval process a challenging one for patients.

Conclusions: Recent federal proposals prioritize patient access to medical records through certified electronic health record (EHR) technology, but access by patients to their complete clinical records via EHRs is years away. In the meantime, health care providers need to focus more attention on compliance with the HIPAA right of access, including better training of staff on HIPAA requirements. Greater enforcement of the law will help motivate providers to prioritize this issue.","/content/10.1101/19004291v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004291v2.full.pdf","2019-11-11","Health Policy

"Relations between near-term white matter tract microstructure, medical complications, and 2-year language outcomes after preterm birth","Aim: To determine associations between 2-year language outcomes and near-term equivalent age diffusion MRI (dMRI) white matter tract metrics in a cohort of preterm children. Method: 32 children, gestational age 28.9 (2.4) weeks, underwent dMRI at mean post-menstrual-age 36.4 (1.4) weeks and language assessment with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development - III at 18-24 months. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated for 6 white matter tracts. Hierarchical linear regression assessed associations between tract FA, moderating variables, and language. Results: Language outcomes correlated positively with FA of the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF-L) (r = 0.44, p < 0.05), and negatively with FA of the posterior corpus callosum (r = -0.41, p < 0.05). Language-brain associations in the ILF-L were independent of the number of neonatal medical complications. Number of neonatal medical complications moderated the relationship between language and posterior corpus callosum FA. Interpretation: The findings suggest that microstructural properties of white matter tracts in the newborn period are associated with language outcomes in the toddler years. The direction of associations varied by fiber group and may relate to the stage of brain maturation and/or the nature and timing of medical complications related to preterm birth.","/content/10.1101/19011361v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011361v1.full.pdf","2019-11-08","Pediatrics

"Transcriptomics of Type 2 Diabetic and Healthy Human Neutrophils","Objectives: Chronic inflammatory diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are heterogeneous and often co-morbid, with increasing global prevalence. Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (T2D) can result in severe inflammatory complications. As neutrophils are essential to inflammation, we conducted RNA-seq transcriptomic analyses to investigate the association between neutrophil gene expression and T2D phenotype. Further, as specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, including resolvin E1 (RvE1), can actively resolve inflammation, we further surveyed the impact of RvE1 on isolated neutrophils.
Methods: Cell isolation and RNA-seq analysis of neutrophils from N=11 T2D and N=7 healthy individuals with available clinical data was conducted. Additionally, cultured neutrophils (N=3 T2D, N=3 healthy) were perturbed with increasing RvE1 doses (0nM, 1nM, 10nM, or 100nM) prior to RNA-seq. Data was evaluated through a bioinformatics pipeline including pathway analysis and post hoc false-discovery rate (FDR)-correction. 
Results: We observed significant differential expression of 50 genes between T2D and healthy neutrophils (p<0.05), including decreased T2D gene expression in inflammatory- and lipid-related genes SLC9A4, NECTIN2 and PLPP3 (p<0.003). RvE1 treatment induced dose-dependent differential gene expression (uncorrected p<0.05) across groups, including 59 healthy and 216 T2D neutrophil genes. Comparing T2D to healthy neutrophils, 1097 genes were differentially expressed across RvE1 doses, including two significant genes, LILRB5 and AKR1C1, involved in inflammation (p<0.05).  
Conclusions: Inflammatory- and lipid-related genes were differentially expressed between T2D and healthy neutrophils, and RvE1 dose-dependently modified gene expression in both groups. Unraveling the mechanisms regulating abnormalities in diabetic neutrophil responses could lead to better diagnostics and therapeutics targeting inflammation and inflammation resolution.","/content/10.1101/19011353v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011353v1.full.pdf","2019-11-08","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Protocol for an observational study evaluating new approaches to modelling diagnostic information from large administrative hospital datasets","Introduction: The Charlson and Elixhauser indices define sets of conditions used to adjust for patients' comorbidities in administrative hospital data. A strength of these indices is the parsimony that results from including only 19 and 30 conditions respectively, but the conditions included may not be the ones most relevant to a specific outcome and population. Our objectives are to: (1) test an approach to developing parsimonious indices for the specific outcome and populations being studied, while comparing performance to the Charlson and Elixhauser indices; and (2) evaluate several approaches that involve models with more diagnosis-related terms and aim to improve prediction performance by capturing more of the information in large datasets.

Methods and analysis: This is a modelling study using a linked national dataset of administrative hospital records and death records. The study populations are patients admitted to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, hip fracture, or major surgery for colorectal cancer in England between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2017. The outcome is death within 365 days of the date of admission (acute myocardial infarction and hip fracture) or procedure (colorectal surgery). In the 'First analysis', prognostic indices will be developed based on the presence/absence of individual ICD-10 codes in patients' medical histories. Logistic regression will be used to estimate associations with a full set of sociodemographic and diagnostic predictors from which reduced models (with fewer diagnostic predictors) will be produced using a step-down approach. In the 'Second analysis', models will also account for the timing that each ICD-10 code was last recorded and allow for non-linear relationships and interactions between conditions and the timings of records. Validation will include an overall measure of performance (scaled Brier score) and measures of discrimination (c-statistic) and calibration (such as the Integrated Calibration Index) in bootstrap or cross-validation samples. Sensitivity analyses will include varying the length of medical history analysed, using a comparator that combines the Charlson and Elixhauser sets of conditions, and aggregating ICD-10 codes into clinical groups.","/content/10.1101/19011338v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011338v1.full.pdf","2019-11-08","Epidemiology

"Performance of the Safer Nursing Care Tool to measure nurse staffing requirements in acute hospitals: a multi-centre observational study","Objectives: To determine the precision of nurse staffing establishments estimated using the SNCT patient classification system, and to assess whether the recommended staff levels correspond with professional judgements of adequate staffing.

Setting / population: 81 medical/surgical units in 4 acute care hospitals. 

Methods: Nurses assessed patients using the SNCT and reported on the adequacy of staffing at least daily for one year. Bootstrap samples of varying sizes were used to estimate the precision of the tool's recommendations for the number of nurses to employ on each unit. Multi-level regression models were used to assess the association between shortfalls from the measured staffing requirement and nurses' assessments of adequate staffing. 

Results: The recommended minimum sample of 20 days allowed the required number to employ to be estimated with a mean precision of 4.1%. For most units, much larger samples were required to estimate establishments within +/- 1 whole time staff member. Every registered nurse hour per patient day shortfall in staffing was associated with an 11% decrease in the odds of nurses reporting that there were enough staff to provide quality care and a 14% increase in the odds of reporting that necessary nursing care was left undone. No threshold indicating an optimal staffing level was observed. Surgical specialty, patient turnover and more single bedded rooms were associated with lower odds of staffing adequacy. 

Conclusions: The SNCT can provide reliable estimates of the number of nurses to employ on a unit, but larger samples than the recommended minimum are usually required. The SNCT provides a measure of nursing workload that correlates with professional judgements but the recommended staffing levels may not be optimal. Some sources of systematic variations in staffing requirements for some units are not accounted for. SNCT measurements are a potentially useful adjunct to professional judgements but cannot replace it.","/content/10.1101/19011320v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011320v1.full.pdf","2019-11-08","Health Informatics

"Microglial activation and tau burden predict cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease","Tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are key aspects of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding whether these features predict cognitive decline, alone or in combination, is crucial to develop new prognostic measures and enhanced stratification for clinical trials. Here, we studied how baseline assessments of in vivo tau pathology (measured by [18F]AV-1451 PET), neuroinflammation (indexed via [11C]PK11195 PET) and brain atrophy (derived from structural MRI) predicted longitudinal cognitive changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Twenty-six patients (n=12 with clinically probable Alzheimer's dementia and n=14 with amyloid positive Mild Cognitive Impairment) and 29 healthy controls underwent baseline assessment with [18F]AV-1451 PET, [11C]PK11195 PET, and structural MRI. Cognition was examined annually over the subsequent 3 years using the revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination. Regional grey-matter volumes, [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK11195 binding were derived from fifteen temporo-parietal regions characteristically affected by Alzheimer's disease pathology. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used on each imaging modality separately, to identify the main spatial distributions of pathology. A Latent Growth Curve model was applied across the whole sample on longitudinal cognitive scores to estimate the rate of annual decline in each participant. We regressed the individuals' estimated slope of cognitive decline on the neuroimaging components and examined univariable models with single-modality predictors, and a multi-modality model of prediction, to identify the independent and combined prognostic value of the different neuroimaging markers. PCA identified a single component for the grey-matter atrophy, while two components were found for each PET ligand: one weighted to the anterior temporal lobe, and another weighted to posterior temporo-parietal regions. Across the whole-sample, the single-modality models indicated significant correlations between the slope of cognitive decline and the first component of each imaging modality. In patients, both stepwise backward elimination and Bayesian model selection revealed an optimal predictive model that included both components of [18F]AV-1451 and the first (i.e., anterior temporal) component for [11C]PK11195. However, the MRI-derived atrophy component and demographic variables were excluded from the optimal predictive model of cognitive decline. We conclude that temporo-parietal tau pathology and anterior temporal neuroinflammation predict cognitive decline in patients with symptomatic Alzheimer's disease pathology. This indicates the added value of PET biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, over and above MRI measures of brain atrophy and demographic data. Our findings also support the strategy for targeting tau and neuroinflammation in disease-modifying therapy against Alzheimer's Disease.","/content/10.1101/19011189v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011189v1.full.pdf","2019-11-08","Neurology

"Plasma Proteome Analysis of Patients with Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated (hATTR) Amyloidosis Establishes Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) as a Biomarker of Disease and Treatment Response","Background: Hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis is a rare, progressively debilitating, and fatal disease caused by deposition of aggregated TTR amyloid in multiple organs and tissues. Highly variable disease penetrance has made it difficult to predict disease onset and progression. Clinically validated and non-invasive plasma biomarkers may facilitate earlier diagnosis, treatment initiation, and aid monitoring of disease progression and improvement of symptoms.
Methods: Plasma levels of >1000 proteins were measured from consenting patients in the Phase 3 APOLLO study who received either placebo or patisiran and in a cohort of healthy individuals. A linear mixed model determined the impact of patisiran treatment on the time profile of each protein at 0, 9, and 18 months. The most significant protein, neurofilament light chain (NfL), was further assessed using an orthogonal quantitative approach.
Findings: A significant change in the levels of 66 proteins was observed following patisiran treatment relative to placebo, with change in NfL, a marker of neuronal damage, the most significant (p<10-20). Analysis of the changes in the levels of these 66 proteins demonstrated that the proteome of patisiran-treated patients trended toward healthy individuals at 18 months. Plasma NfL levels in healthy controls were 4-fold lower than in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (16.3 [SD 12.0] pg/mL vs 69.4 [SD 42.1] pg/mL, p<10-16). Levels of NfL at 18 months increased in placebo-treated patients (99.5 [SD 60.1] pg/mL) and decreased in patisiran-treated patients (48.8 [SD 29.9] pg/mL). Moreover, at 18 months, improvement in mNIS+7 compared to baseline in patisiran-treated patients significantly correlated with a reduction in NfL levels (R=0.43, p<10-7).
Interpretation: NfL may serve as a biomarker of nerve damage and polyneuropathy in hATTR amyloidosis, as illustrated by the observed correlation with patisiran treatment and improvement in mNIS+7. Measurement of NfL levels may potentially enable earlier diagnosis of polyneuropathy in patients with hATTR amyloidosis and facilitate monitoring of disease progression/regression.","/content/10.1101/19011155v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011155v1.full.pdf","2019-11-08","Neurology

"Clinical and Inflammatory Factors Influencing Constipation and Quality of Life in Cerebral Palsy","Introduction: Intestinal constipation is a clinical consequence, secondary to neuromotor disturbances, which acts on subjects with cerebral palsy (CP). The aim of this study was to investigate the factors influencing constipation and the quality of life (QOL) of CP subjects.
Materials and methods: We recruited a total of 63 subjects aging from 5-17 years with spastic CP who received physical rehabilitation. The subjects were divided into two groups including with and without constipation. Subjects were assigned into one of the 4 groups (G1-4) based on the prevalence of 1) CP and 2) Constipation. Subjects were
assigned as CP with constipation (G1), CP without constipation (G2), and controls without CP with constipation (G3) and without CP and without constipation (G4). Subject demographics, use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), motor function, caregiver
priorities and child health index of life with disabilities (CPCHILD) were included. In addition to medical metadata, a subset of subjects was evaluated for oral and systemic
inflammation through gingival bleeding and serum cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) respectively. Statistical significance was evaluated by ANOVA One-Way (parametric data) and Kruskal Wallis (non-parametric data).
Results: A significant relationship was found between the type of medication and
constipation. Subjects taking GABA and GABA+ (GABA in association with other medication) were more likely to be constipated than the other groups (P < 0.01).
Additionally, quality of life was directly correlated with constipation; subjects in G1 presented the lower mean score of CPCHILD (49.0 SD13.1) compared to G2 (71.5 SD 16.7) when compared to G3 (88.9 SD 7.5), and G4 (95.5 SD5.0) (P < 0.01). Inflammation was more severe for patients in G1 (P < 0.001). There were no differences among groups regarding gender (P = 0.332) and age (P = 0.292).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that constipation was mostly affected by the use of certain antiepileptic drugs, namely GABA. This showed a direct detrimental effect on CP quality of life, which was influenced by inflammatory cytokines and the dosage and type of AEDs.","/content/10.1101/19011296v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011296v1.full.pdf","2019-11-08","Dentistry and Oral Medicine

"Specific Symptom Profiles are Associated with Distinct Changes in Amygdala Connectivity in Youth","Complex clinical presentations are common in youth seeking mental health treatment, complicating attempts to identify specific biological underpinnings to guide precision psychiatry. We defined four classes of such youth based on their symptom profiles and identified unique patterns of amygdala functional connectivity in each class.
Subjects were 215 youth who varied along major symptom dimensions commonly associated with pediatric affective psychopathology: depression, irritability, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD). We used latent profile analysis to identify classes of symptom patterns. Functional MRI data were obtained while subjects completed a gender identification task of face-emotions that varied in emotion type and intensity. We used generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis to examine associations between the probability of being in each symptom class and amygdala functional connectivity.

The likelihood of being in the class with high parent-reported irritability and ADHD symptoms was associated with amygdala connectivity to the insula and superior temporal gyrus while processing high-intensity angry and fearful faces; to the precuneus while processing intensity across emotions; and to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex across all task conditions. The likelihood of being in the class with high anxious and depressive symptoms was negatively associated with amygdala-thalamic connectivity across task conditions.

This is the first study to identify distinct associations between symptom profile classes and amygdala connectivity in a transdiagnostic sample of youth. These neural correlates provide external validity to latent classes derived from symptom clusters. This is an essential first step toward identifying the biological basis of common transdiagnostic symptom presentations in youth.","/content/10.1101/19010165v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010165v1.full.pdf","2019-11-08","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Tensor Fasciae Suralis: Prevalence Study and Literature Review","Tensor fasciae suralis (TFS) is an accessory muscle of the posterior lower extremity. Although TFS has been documented in cadaveric and radiological reports, its prevalence remains unknown. The TFS variant is noteworthy to anatomists, as it may be encountered in the dissection laboratory, and clinicians, as the muscle could potentially cause confusion during physical examination or diagnostic imaging. Multiple variations of TFS have been reported in the literature, suggesting the need for a classification system. We dissected 236 formalin-fixed cadaveric lower limbs to determine the prevalence of TFS. The PubMed and MEDLINE databases were searched to compare the anatomical features of independent TFS case reports. In our prevalence study, the TFS muscle was identified in three lower limbs (1.3%). In total, 35 cases of TFS (31 cadaveric and four radiological) were identified in the literature. Our literature review revealed that the accessory muscle most often arises as a single head from the long head of the biceps femoris, yet many other presentations have been documented. The need for a classification system to distinguish between the subtypes of TFS became apparent during the literature review. Tensor fasciae suralis is a rare muscle, present in only 3 of 236 (1.3%) cadaveric lower limbs dissected in this study. We propose the use of a classification system, based on muscle origin and number of heads, to better organize the subtypes of TFS.","/content/10.1101/19010389v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010389v1.full.pdf","2019-11-08","Sports Medicine

"Spatiotemporal tools for emerging and endemic disease hotspots in small areasâ€”an analysis of dengue and chikungunya in Barbados, 2013 - 2016","Objective: To detect potential hotspots of transmission of dengue and chikungunya in Barbados, and assess impact of input surveillance data and methodology on observed patterns of risk.
Methods: Using two methods of cluster detection, Moranâ€™s I and spatial scan statistics, we analyzed the geospatial and temporal distribution of disease cases and rates across Barbados for dengue fever in 2013-2016, and a 2014 chikungunya outbreak.
Results: During years with high numbers of dengue cases, hotspots for cases were found with Moranâ€™s I in south and central regions in 2013 and 2016, respectively. Using smoothed disease rates, clustering was detected every year for dengue. Hotspots were not detected via spatial scan statistics, but coldspots suggesting lower rates of disease activity were found in southwestern Barbados during high case years of dengue. 
Conclusions: Spatial analysis of surveillance data is useful in identifying outbreak hotspots, complementing existing early warning systems. We caution that these methods should be used in a manner appropriate to available data, and reflecting explicit public health goalsâ€”managing for overall case numbers, or targeting anomalous rates for further investigation.","/content/10.1101/19011262v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011262v1.full.pdf","2019-11-06","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Successful suppression of a field population of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes using a novel biological vector control strategy is associated with significantly lower incidence of dengue","Background. Despite extensive efforts to prevent recurrent Aedes-borne arbovirus epidemics, there is a steady rise in their global incidence.  Vaccines/treatments show very limited efficacy and together with the emergence of mosquito resistance to insecticides, it has become urgent to develop alternative solutions for efficient, sustainable and environmentally benign mosquito vector control. Here we present a new Sterile Insect Technology (SIT)-based program that uses large-scale releases of sterile male mosquitoes produced by a highly effective, safe and environmentally benign method. 
Methods and findings. To test the efficacy of this approach, a field trial was conducted in a Brazilian city (Jacarezinho), which presented a history of 3 epidemics of dengue in the past decade. Sterile male mosquitoes were produced from a locally acquired Aedes aegypti colony, and releases were carried out on a weekly basis for seven months in a predefined area. This treated area was matched to a control area, in terms of size, layout, historic mosquito infestation index, socioeconomic patterns and comparable prevalence of dengue cases in past outbreaks. Releases of sterile male mosquitoes resulted in up to 91.4% reduction of live progeny of field Ae. aegypti mosquitoes recorded over time. The reduction in the mosquito population was corroborated by the standard monitoring system (LIRAa index) as determined by the local municipality, which found that our treated neighborhoods were almost free of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes after 5 months of release, whereas neighborhoods adjacent to the treated area and the control neighborhoods were highly infested. Importantly, when a dengue outbreak started in Jacarezinho in March 2019, the effective mosquito population suppression was shown to be associated with a far lower incidence of dengue in the treated area (16 cases corresponding to 264 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) almost 16 times lower than the dengue incidence in the control area (198 cases corresponding to 4,360 dengue cases per 100,000 inhabitants). 
Conclusions. Our data present the first demonstration that a SIT-based intervention has the potential to prevent the spread of dengue, opening exciting new opportunities for preventing mosquito-borne disease.","/content/10.1101/19010678v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010678v1.full.pdf","2019-11-06","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Findings of a feasibility study of pre-operative pulmonary rehabilitation to reduce post-operative pulmonary complications in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease scheduled for major abdominal surgery.","Background: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of complications and death following surgery. Pulmonary complications are particularly prominent.  Pulmonary rehabilitation is a course of physical exercise and education that helps people with COPD manage their condition.  Although proven to improve health outcomes in patients with stable COPD, it has never been formally tested as a pre-surgical intervention in patients scheduled for non-cardiothoracic surgery.  If a beneficial effect were to be demonstrated, pulmonary rehabilitation for pre-surgical patients with COPD might be rapidly implemented across the National Health Service, as pulmonary rehabilitation courses are already well established across much of the United Kingdom (UK). 
Methods: We performed a feasibility study to test study procedures and barriers to identification and recruitment to a randomised controlled trial testing whether pulmonary rehabilitation, delivered before major abdominal surgery in a population of people with COPD, would reduce the incidence of post-operative pulmonary complications.  This study was run in two UK centres (Oxford and Newcastle upon Tyne).
Results:  We determined that a full randomised controlled trial would not be feasible, due to failure to identify and recruit participants.  We identified an unmet need to identify more effectively patients with COPD earlier in the surgical pathway.  Service evaluations suggested that barriers to identification and recruitment would likely be the same across other UK hospitals.
Conclusions:  Although pulmonary rehabilitation is a potentially beneficial intervention to prevent post-operative pulmonary complications, a randomised controlled trial is unlikely to recruit sufficient participants to answer our study question conclusively at the present time, when spirometry is not automatically conducted in all patients planned for surgery.  As pulmonary rehabilitation is a recommended treatment for all people with COPD, alternative study methods combined with earlier identification of candidate patients in the surgical pathway should be considered.

"Identification of de novo mutations in prenatal neurodevelopment-associated genes in schizophrenia in two Han Chinese patient-sibling family-based cohorts","Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. High heritability of SCZ suggests a major role for transmitted genetic variants. Furthermore, SCZ is also associated with a marked reduction in fecundity, leading to the hypothesis that alleles with large effects on risk might often occur de novo. In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing for 23 families from two cohorts, Taiwan and Shanghai, with matched unaffected siblings and parents. Two nonsense de novo mutations (DNMs) in GJC1 and HIST1H2AD were identified in SCZ patients. By performing DNM-based burden test, we found that DPYSL2, NBPF1, SDK1, ZNF595, ZNF718, GCNT2, SNX9, AACS, KCNQ1 and MSI2 genes carried more DNMs in SCZ patients than their unaffected siblings. Developmental expression analyses revealed that the loss-of-function DNM genes and DNM-burdened genes showed significantly higher expression in prefrontal cortex in prenatal stage. The biased high expression of GJC1 and SDK1 in fetus were preserved in other brain regions and conserved across species. Data from genome-wide association studies suggested that common variants in the GJC1, HIST1H2AD and SDK1 genes may contribute to the risks of SCZ and SCZ-related traits. Analyses on GJC1 revealed that genes co-expressed with GJC1 were involved in SCZ, SCZ-associated pathways and drug targets. GJC1 may be a potential target for SCZ in prenatal and early neurodevelopment.","/content/10.1101/19011007v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011007v2.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Association of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms with Dyslipidemia in Antiretroviral Exposed HIV Patients in a Ghanaian population","Dyslipidemia is a potential complication of long-term usage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and also known to be associated with genetic factors. The host genetic variants associated with dyslipidemia in HIV patients on ART in Ghana have not been fully explored. The study constituted a total of  289 HIV-infected patients on stable ART for at least a year and 85 aged matched apparently healthy control subjects with no history of HIV and dyslipidemia. Fasting blood was collected into EDTA tube for lipids measurements. Lipid profiles were determined as a measure of dyslipidemia. HIV-infected patients were categorized into two groups; those with dyslipidemia(HIV-Dys+) (n=90; 31.1%) and without  dyslipidemia (n=199; 68.9%) based on the NCEP-ATP III criteria. Four candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genes (ABCA1-rs2066714, LDLR-rs6511720, APOA5-rs662799 and DSCAML1-rs10892151) were determined. Genotyping was performed on isolated genomic DNA of study participants using PCR followed by a multiplex Ligation Detection Reaction (LDR). The percentage of the population who had the rare homozygote alleles for rs6511720 (T/T), rs2066714 (G/G), and rs10892151 (T/T) and rs662799 (G/G) among  HIV+Dys+ subjects were 5.5%, 14.4%, 6.6% and 10.0%; 2.0% 9.1%, 6.5% and 4.0% among HIV+Dys- subjects while 3.5%, 4.7%, 4.7% and 2.4% were observed in HIV-Dys- subjects. Statistically significant difference in genotypic prevalence of  APOA5 polymorphisms was observed among different groups (p=0.0196). Compared to the AA genotype of the APOA5 polymorphisms, individuals with the rare homozygote genotype [aOR =4.01, 95%CI(1.57-22.39), p=0.004] were significantly more likely to develop dyslipidemia after controlling for age, gender, treatment duration and CD4 counts among the HIV+Dys+ subjects. There was also a significant associated between GG genotype of ABCA1 and dyslipidemia [aOR =3.29, 95% (1.08 -12.43); p=0.042] . Individuals with the rare homozygote variant (GG) of APOA5 (rs662799) were significantly associated with increased likelihood of developing dyslipidemia [OR =2.24, 95% CI (1.20 -6.83); p=0.0370] holding other variables constant in the HIV+Dys- subjects. Our data accentuate the presence of SNPs in four candidate genes and its association with dyslipidemia  among HIV patients exposed to ART in the Ghanaian population especially variants in APOA5-rs662799  ABCA1-rs2066714 respectively. These findings provide baseline information that necessitates a pre-symptomatic strategy for monitoring dyslipidemia in ART-treated HIV patients. There is a need for longitudinal studies to validate a comprehensive number of SNPs and its association with dyslipidemia.","/content/10.1101/19004812v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004812v2.full.pdf","2019-11-05","HIV/AIDS

"Altered subcortical emotional salience processing differentiates Parkinson's patients with and without psychotic symptoms","Background: Current research does not provide a clear explanation for why some patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) develop psychotic symptoms. In the field of schizophrenia research the 'aberrant salience hypothesis' of psychosis has been influential. According to the theory, dopaminergic dysregulation leads to the inappropriate attribution of salience to otherwise irrelevant or non-informative stimuli, allowing for the formation of hallucinations and delusions. This theory has not yet been extensively investigated in the context of psychosis in PD. Methods: We investigated salience processing in 14 PD patients with a history of psychotic symptoms, 23 PD patients without psychotic symptoms and 19 healthy controls. All patients received dopaminergic medication. We examined emotional salience using a visual oddball fMRI paradigm (Bunzeck and Duezel, 2006) that previously has been used to investigate early stages of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, controlling for resting cerebral blood flow as assessed with arterial spin labelling fMRI. Results: We found significant differences between patient groups in brain responses to emotional salience. PD patients with psychotic symptoms revealed senhanced brain responses in the striatum, the hippocampus and the amygdala compared to PD patients without psychotic symptoms. PD patients with psychotic symptoms also showed significant correlations between the levels of dopaminergic drugs they were taking and BOLD signalling, as well as psychotic symptom scores. Furthermore, our data provide a first indication for dysfunctional top-down processes, measured in a 'jumping to conclusions' bias. Conclusion: Our study suggests that enhanced signalling in the striatum, hippocampus and amygdala together with deficient top-down cognitive regulations is associated with the development of psychotic symptoms in PD which is similar to that proposed in the 'aberrant salience hypothesis' of psychosis in schizophrenia.","/content/10.1101/19010512v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010512v2.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Quaternary Prevention: Is this Concept Relevant to Public Health? A Bibliometric and Descriptive Content Analysis.","Objective: To measure and map research output on Quaternary Prevention (P4) and outline research trends; to assess the papers content, mainly regarding methods and subjects approached in order to contribute to the improvement of global knowledge about P4 and to evaluate its relevance for public health.
Design: Bibliometric and descriptive content analysis.
Articles reviewed: Scientific articles about P4 recorded in Pubmed, LILACS, Scielo or CINAHL published until August 2018, with correspondent full articles available in Portuguese, English, Spanish, German or French.
Main outcome measures: Year of publication, first authors' name and nationality, journals' name, country and ranking, publication language, used methods and main reported subjects.
Results: 65 articles were included, published in 33 journals of 16 countries between 2003 and 2018 with a peak of publications in 2015. The first authors came from 17 different countries, 23% of them were Brazilian and Uruguay was the leading nation according to the scientific production per capita. 40% of all the selected articles were in English, 32% in Portuguese, 26% in Spanish. 28% of the papers were published in Q1 or Q2 journals. The research outputs on P4 begun first in the South of Europe, went to South America and then expanded worldwide. 88% of the articles were bibliographic research and 38% of all focused on specific examples of medical overuse (including several screening tests).
Conclusions: Quaternary prevention represents an ethical and valid approach to prevent occurence of iatrogenic events and to achieve equal and fair access to health services. Conceptual, geographical and linguistic elements, as well as WONCA conferences and type of healthcare systems in the authors' country were fundamental factors that affected research output. The quality and quantity of available studies is still limited, therefore further investigations are recommended to assess the effective impact of P4 on public health.","/content/10.1101/19007526v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007526v3.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Public and Global Health

"Towards a differential diagnosis of cochlear synaptopathy and outer-hair-cell deficits in mixed sensorineural hearing loss pathologies","Damage to the auditory periphery is more widespread than predicted by the gold-standard clinical audiogram. Noise exposure, ototoxicity and aging can destroy cochlear inner-hair-cell afferent synapses and result in a degraded subcortical representation of sound while leaving hearing thresh- olds unaffected. Damaged afferent synapses, i.e. cochlear synaptopathy, can be quantified using histology, but a differential diagnosis in living hu- mans is difficult: histology cannot be applied and existing auditory evoked potential (AEP) metrics for synaptopathy become insensitive when other sensorineural hearing impairments co-exist (e.g., outer-hair-cell damage associated with elevated hearing thresholds). To develop a non-invasive diagnostic method which quantifies synaptopathy in humans and animals with normal or elevated hearing thresholds, we employ a computational model approach in combination with human AEP and psychoacoustics. We propose the use of a sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) map which comprises two relative AEP-based metrics to quantify the respective de- grees of synaptopathy and OHC damage and evaluate to which degree our predictions of AEP alterations can explain individual data-points in recorded SNHL maps from listeners with normal or elevated audiometric thresholds. We conclude that SNHL maps can offer a more precise diag- nostic tool than existing AEP methods for individual assessment of the synaptopathy and OHC-damage aspect of sensorineural hearing loss.","/content/10.1101/19008680v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008680v2.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Otolaryngology

"Cost-effectiveness of the next generation of RSV intervention strategies","Background
With a suite of promising new RSV prophylactics on the horizon, including long-acting monoclonal antibodies and new vaccines, it is likely that one or more of these will replace the current monoclonal Palivizumab programme. However, choosing the optimal intervention programme will require balancing the costs of the programmes with the health benefits accrued. 

Methods
To compare the next generation of RSV prophylactics, we integrated a novel transmission model with an economic analysis. We estimated key epidemiological parameters by calibrating the model to seven years of historical epidemiological data using a Bayesian approach. We determined the cost-effective and affordable maximum purchase price for a comprehensive suite of intervention programmes. 
 
Findings
Our transmission model suggests that maternal protection of infants is seasonal, with 2-14% of infants born with protection against RSV. Our economic analysis found that to cost-effectively and affordably replace the current monoclonal antibody Palivizumab programme with long-acting monoclonal antibodies, the purchase price per dose would have to be less than around <U+FFE1>4,350 but dropping to <U+FFE1>200 for vaccinated heightened risk infants or <U+FFE1>90 for all infants. A seasonal maternal vaccine would have to be priced less than <U+FFE1>85 to be cost-effective and affordable. While vaccinating pre-school and school-age children is likely not cost-effective relative to elderly vaccination programmes, vaccinating the elderly is not likely to be affordable. Conversely, vaccinating infants at 2 months seasonally would be cost-effective and affordable if priced less than <U+FFE1>80.
 
Interpretations
In a setting with seasonal RSV epidemiology, maternal protection conferred to newborns is also seasonal, an assumption not previously incorporated in transmission models of RSV. For a country with seasonal RSV dynamics like England, seasonal programmes rather than year-round intervention programmes are always optimal.","/content/10.1101/19009977v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009977v3.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Public and Global Health

"Disruptive and protective outcomes to memory and attention when treating diffuse glioma","Surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective treatments to delay glioma progression and improve survival. Nevertheless, a large proportion of patients have treatment-induced cognitive deficits that dramatically reduce their life quality. Predicting the treatment-induced functional impairments is difficult due to the complex interlocking and diffusely spread networks that underpin different aspects of cognition. Here we investigated glioma interactions with brain networks in relation to cognitive recovery after surgical resection and during chemo-radiotherapy treatment. Seventeen patients with diffuse non-enhancing glioma (aged 22-56 years) were longitudinally MRI-scanned and cognitively assessed using a tablet-based screening tool before and after surgery, and during a 12-months recovery period. Using structural MRI and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) derived from diffusion-weighted images, we respectively estimated tumour overlap and Neurite Density (as an in-vivo proxy measure of axon and dendrite concentration) with brain networks and functional maps derived from normative data in healthy participants. We found that neither total lesion volume nor tumour location based on traditional lobular divisions were associated with memory or attention deficits. However, tumour and lesion overlap with the Default Mode Network (DMN), Attention Network and attention-related regions located in frontal and parietal cortex was associated with memory and attention deficits. This association was above and beyond the contributions of preoperative cognitive status and tumour volume (Linear Mixed Model, Pfdr<0.05). On the other hand, Neurite Density was reduced not only within the tumour, but also beyond the tumour boundary, revealing a distal effect with global consequences to brain networks. High preoperative Neurite Density outside the tumour, but within the Frontoparietal Network was associated with better memory and attention recovery. Moreover, postoperative and follow-up Neurite Density within the DMN, Frontoparietal and Attention Networks were associated with memory and attention improvements (Pfdr<0.05). We conclude that gliomas located on brain networks that are fundamental for cognitive processing mediate cognitive deficits and they exert a distal effect on Neurite Density in these networks that is also associated with cognitive recovery. Our work provides insights into the brain reorganisation that occurs due to the presence of a tumour and its subsequent removal, which has potential capability to predict cognitive outcomes. Understanding the pathophysiology underlying tumour related cognitive outcomes will be vital to the development of novel prognostic biomarkers, subgroup stratification in clinical trials, and individualised rehabilitation programmes.","/content/10.1101/19008581v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008581v2.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Radiology and Imaging

"Time trends in socio-economic inequalities in HIV testing: insights from population-based surveys in 16 sub-Saharan African countries","Background
Overall increase in the uptake of HIV testing in the past decades may hide discrepancies across socio-economic groups. We used population-based surveys conducted in sub-Saharan Africa to quantify socio-economic inequalities in recent HIV testing uptake, together with their trends over the two past decades.
Methods
We analyzed the data from Demographic and Health Surveys in sub-Saharan African countries where at least one survey was conducted before and after 2008. Country- and gender-specific proportions of recent (<12 month) HIV testing were assessed across wealth and education groups, and inequalities were quantified using the relative and slope indices of inequalities. Time trends in inequalities were assessed and results were pooled across countries using random-effect meta-analyses.
Findings
We analyzed data from 32 surveys conducted between 2003 and 2016 in 16 countries among 537,784 participants. In pre-2008 surveys, women reported higher HIV testing uptake than men in 8 out of 16 countries, and in 15 out of 16 countries in post-2008 surveys. After 2008, the wealthiest women were on average 2.77 (95% CI 1.42-5.40) times more likely to report recent testing than the poorest; and 3.55 (1.85-6.81) times in men. The averaged absolute difference in recent testing between the richest and poorest was 11.1 (4.6-17.5) percentage points in women and 15.1 (9.6-20.6) in men. Over time, relative inequalities in recent HIV testing decreased in both genders, while absolute inequalities plateaued in women and increased in men.

Interpretations	
The overall increase in HIV testing uptake that was stimulated by the impetus to scale up HIV treatment in sub-Saharan Africa led to a decrease in relative inequalities, while absolute inequalities persisted. Within most countries, large inequalities still remained, both in absolute and relative scales, especially in West and Central Africa. A greater focus should be put on equity in monitoring HIV testing programs.

"Efficacy of a spatial repellent for control of malaria in Indonesia: a cluster-randomized controlled trial.","A cluster randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to estimate protective efficacy of a spatial repellent against malaria infection at Sumba, Indonesia. Following radical cure in 1,341 children aged =6 months - =5 years in 24 clusters, households were given transfluthrin or placebo passive emanators. Monthly blood screening and biweekly human-landing mosquito catches (HLC) were performed during 10-months baseline (June 2015 to March 2016) and a 24-month intervention period (April 2016 to April 2018).  Screening detected 164 first-time malaria infections and an accumulative total of 459 infections in 667 subjects in placebo-control households; and 134 first-time and 253 accumulative total infections among 665 subjects in active intervention households. The 24-cluster protective effect of 27.7% and 31.3%, for time to first-event and overall (total new) infections, respectively, was not statistically significant. Purportedly, this was likely due in part to zero to low incidence in some clusters, undermining the ability to detect a protective effect from spatial repellent intervention. Subgroup analysis of 19 clusters where at least one malaria infection occurred during the baseline showed 36.0% and 40.9% (statistically significant at 1-sided 5% significance level; p =0.0236) protective effect to first-infection and overall infections, respectively. Among 12 moderate- to high-risk clusters, a statistically significant decrease on infection by the spatial repellent was detected (60% protective efficacy). Primary entomological analysis of impact was inconclusive and proved not statistically significant. While this study suggests protective effects of the intervention, additional evidence is required to demonstrate that spatial repellents provide an operationally feasible and effective means of reducing malaria transmission.","/content/10.1101/19003426v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003426v3.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Public and Global Health

Several studies have been devoted to explain these counter-intuitive trends in SPVL. However, to our knowledge, none of these studies has investigated an explanation in which it arises as the result of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) co-factor in detail.
In this study, we adapted an event-based, individual-based model to investigate how STI co-infection and sexual risk behaviour affect the evolution of HIV SPVL in MSM before and after the introduction of ART.
The results suggest that both STI co-factors and sexual risk behaviour have an effect on SPVL. However, the observed trends in SPVL cannot be explained by sexual risk behaviour and STI co-factors only.
We recommend to develop mathematical models including also factors related to  viral evolution as reported earlier in the literature. However, this requires more complex models, and the collection of more data for parameter estimation than what is currently available.","/content/10.1101/19011221v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011221v1.full.pdf","2019-11-05","HIV/AIDS

"Demonstration of a portable intracortical brain-computer interface","While recent advances in intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) have demonstrated the ability to restore motor and communication functions, such demonstrations have generally been confined to controlled experimental settings and have required bulky laboratory hardware. Here, we developed and evaluated a self-contained portable iBCI that enabled the user to interact with various computer programs. The iBCI, which weighs 1.5 kg, consists of digital headstages, a small signal processing hub, and a tablet PC. A human participant tested the portable iBCI in laboratory and home settings under an FDA Investigational Device Exemption (NCT01894802). The participant successfully completed 96% of trials in a 2D cursor center-out task with the portable iBCI, a rate indistinguishable from that achieved with the standard laboratory iBCI. The participant also completed a variety of free-form tasks, including drawing, gaming, and typing.","/content/10.1101/19004721v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004721v2.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"A spatio-temporal approach to short-term forecasting of visceral leishmaniasis diagnoses in India","Background:
The elimination programme for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in India has seen great progress, with total cases decreasing by over 80% since 2010 and many blocks now reporting zero cases from year to year.  Prompt diagnosis and treatment is critical to continue progress and avoid epidemics in the increasingly susceptible population. Short-term forecasts could be used to highlight anomalies in incidence and support health service logistics. The model which best fits the data is not necessarily most useful for prediction, yet little empirical work has been done to investigate the balance between fit and predictive performance. 
Principal Findings: 
We developed statistical models of monthly VL case counts at block level. By evaluating a set of randomly-generated models, we found that fit and one-month-ahead prediction were strongly correlated and that rolling updates to model parameters as data accrued were not crucial for accurate prediction.  The final model incorporated auto-regression over four months, spatial correlation between neighbouring blocks,and seasonality. Ninety-four percent of 10-90% prediction intervals from this model captured the observed count during a 24-month test period.  Comparison of one-, three- and four-month-ahead predictions from the final model fit demonstrated that a longer time horizon yielded only a small sacrifice in predictive power for the vast majority of blocks.
Conclusions:
The model developed is informed by routinely-collected surveillance data as it accumulates, and predictions are sufficiently accurate and precise to be useful.  Such forecasts could, for example, be used to guide stock requirements for rapid diagnostic tests and drugs.  More comprehensive data on factors thought to influence geographic variation in VL burden could be incorporated, and might better explain the heterogeneity between blocks and improve uniformity of predictive performance.Integration of the approach in the management of the VL programme would be an important step to ensuring continued successful control. and processing of the data,predictive power more than three months ahead of current data is crucial to make forecasts which can feasibly be acted upon. Some heterogeneity remains in predictive power across the study region which could potentially be improved using unit-specific data on factors believed to be associated with reported VL incidence (e.g. age distribution, socio-economic status and climate)","/content/10.1101/19009258v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009258v2.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Public and Global Health

"LncRNA and predictive model for improving the diagnosis of clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis","Background: Clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients lack Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) microbiologic evidence, and misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis often occurs as a consequence. We investigated the potential of lncRNAs and corresponding predictive models to diagnose these patients.
Methods: We enrolled 1372 subjects, including clinically diagnosed PTB patients, non-TB disease controls and healthy controls, in three cohorts (Screening, Selection and Validation). Candidate lncRNAs differentially expressed in blood samples of the PTB and healthy control groups were identified by microarray and qRT-PCR in the Screening Cohort. Logistic regression models were developed using lncRNAs and/or electronic health records (EHRs) from clinically diagnosed PTB patients and non-TB disease controls in the Selection Cohort. These models were evaluated by AUC and decision curve analysis, and the optimal model was presented as a Web-based nomogram, which was evaluated in the Validation Cohort. The biological function of lncRNAs was interrogated using ELISA, lactate dehydrogenase release analysis and flow cytometry.
Results: Three differentially expressed lncRNAs (ENST00000497872, n333737, n335265) were identified. The optimal model (i.e., nomogram) incorporated these three lncRNAs and six EHR variables (age, hemoglobin, weight loss, low-grade fever, CT calcification and TB-IGRA). The nomogram showed an AUC of 0.89, sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.82 in the Validation Cohort, which demonstrated better discrimination and clinical net benefit than the EHR model. ENST00000497872 may regulate inflammatory cytokine production, cell death and apoptosis during MTB infection. 
Conclusion: LncRNAs and the user-friendly nomogram could facilitate the early identification of PTB cases among suspected patients with negative MTB microbiologic evidence.","/content/10.1101/19000281v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000281v2.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"The day-to-day experiences of caring for children with Osteogenesis Imperfecta: A qualitative descriptive study","Aims and objectives: This study aimed to explore the day-to-day experiences of caregivers who are caring for children with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). 

Background: OI is a rare genetic condition known to cause bone fragility. Family caregivers, such as parents, of children with OI play an important role in helping these children live well at home.
Design: The design was qualitative description.

Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted which adheres to the COREQ guidelines. Adult caregivers (n=18) of children with OI were recruited at a children's hospital in Montreal, Canada to participate in individual interviews. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and inductively thematically analysed.

Results: The following caregiving themes were identified in these interviews: regular day-to-day caregiving activities, including morning routines, evening routines, and the facilitation of their child's mobilization; periods that made the caregiving routine more challenging, such as fractures, surgeries, and pain; and the long-term strategies caregivers developed to support day-to-day care, such as managing the environment, accessing medical and school resources, and coordinating care and respite.

Conclusions: The results showcase what being a caregiver for a child with OI involves on a day-to-day basis. 

Relevance to clinical practice: The recommendations include suggestions for future clinical, policy, and research endeavours to develop better policies and interventions to support the unique needs of family caregivers of children with OI. These recommendations may be relevant to other clinicians and policymakers working with families living with rare and chronic physical conditions.

"Physicians in the management and leadership of health care: A systematic review of the conditions conducive to organizational performance","Introduction: The influx of management ideas into health care has triggered considerable debate about if and how managerial and medical logics can co-exist. Recent reviews suggest that clinician involvement in hospital leadership can lead to superior performance. 
Objective: To systematically explore the conditions instrumental for medical leadership to have an impact on organizational performance.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Psychinfo for peer-reviewed, empirical, English language articles and reviews published between January 1, 2006 and August 12, 2018. We performed a thematic synthesis through inductive line-by-line coding of the included studies. 
Results: The search yielded 1447 publications, of which 62 were included. Three major themes were identified that described a movement 1. From medical protectionism to management through medicine, 2. From command and control to participatory leadership practices, and 3. Organizational practices to support incidental versus willing leaders. Based on these themes, the authors developed a model to depict conditions that facilitate or impede the influence of medical leadership through a virtuous cycle of management through medicine or a vicious cycle of medical protectionism.  
Conclusions: This review helps individuals, organizations, educators, and trainers better understand how medical leadership can be both a boon and a barrier to the performance of health care organizations. In contrast to the conventional view of conflicting logics, medical leadership would benefit from a more integrative mental model of management and medicine. Nurturing medical engagement requires participatory leadership enabled through long-term investments at the individual, organizational, and system levels. These combined efforts will enable a shift to new leadership paradigms suitable to the complexity of health care, and establish conditions favorable for large-system transformation and health care reform.

"Lower germline mutation rates in young adults predict longer lives and longer reproductive lifespans","BACKGROUND
Genome sequencing of large three-generation families allows de novo mutations to be identified in the second
generation, validated and phased in the third generation, and ultimately attributed to the first-generation
germlines in which they arose. Because germline mutations accumulate with age, we hypothesized that they
may limit the duration of childbearing in women, and if accompanied by accumulation of mutations in somatic
tissues, reflect aging rates generally in both sexes. Here we test whether germ cell mutations present in a
Generation I cohort when they were young adults predict two clinically important outcomes in those same
individuals: survival in both sexes, and age-related fertility decline in women. We also explore a possible
linkage between the timing of puberty and the establishment of adult germline mutation accumulation rates.
METHODS
Germline mutation counts in 122 Generation I individuals (61 women, 61 men) from 41 three-generation Utah
families were converted to germline mutation rates by normalizing each subject's number of mutations to the
callable fraction of their genome. Age at death, cause of death, cancer incidence, and reproductive histories
were provided by the Utah Population Database, Utah Cancer Registry, and Utah Genetic Reference Project.
Fertility analyses were restricted to the 53 women whose age at last birth (ALB) was at least 30 years, the
approximate age when the decline in female fertility ending with menopause begins. The age when adult
germline mutation accumulation rates are established was estimated by regression analyses of the
Generation I data. Self-reported age at menarche was available for 20 of the Generation I women.
RESULTS
After adjusting for birth year, sex, and parental age effects in Cox proportional hazard regression models, a
one standard deviation increase in the germline mutation rates present in the Generation I cohort when they
were young adults predicted significantly higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.97; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.12-3.46; p=0.019) in those same individuals. The median survival advantage for subjects with
mutation rates < 25th percentile vs. those with mutation rates > 75th percentile was approximately 8 years for
women and 13 years for men. Among women with ALB = 30 years, those in the top 50% of germline mutation
rates had significantly fewer live births than those in the bottom 25% (p=0.026), and higher mutation rates were
significantly associated (p=0.036) with a younger ALB (<25th percentile, 34.8 years). Linear regression
analyses indicate that the germline mutation accumulation rates of adulthood are established no earlier than
middle to late childhood. We therefore investigated the hypothesis that puberty induces mutation accumulation
after a prepubertal phase when mutation burdens are plateaued. As predicted, among Generation I women,
those reporting older ages at menarche had significantly lower germline mutation rates. Furthermore,
Generation II parental couples with similar germline mutation accumulation rates (mainly reflecting mutations
accumulating in fathers) varied about five years in the paternal age at which they acquired the same number of
mutations, as would be expected if puberty, which also has a range of onset of approximately 5 years, causes
a resumption of mutation accumulation after a plateaued prepubertal phase.
CONCLUSIONS
Germline mutation accumulation rates in healthy young adults may provide a measure of both reproductive
and systemic aging. The data further suggest that mutation accumulation rates are established around puberty,
just when DNA repair genes' expression levels are known to begin their lifelong decline.","/content/10.1101/19004184v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004184v2.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Epidemiology

"Heterogeneity in prognostic value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio: a meta-analysis","High pre-treatment values of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are strongly associated with poorer survival outcomes in cancer patients. Here, we assess heterogeneity in the magnitude of this association and the prognostic potential of the NLR between patient subgroups. We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of 228 published studies (N=75,555 patients) relating NLR with overall survival across 18 cancer types. Cochran's Q test and Higgins I2 statistic were used to assess study heterogeneity. Pooled hazard ratios were compared between groups of studies classified by cancer type, geographic region, therapy type, and cut-off for high NLR to identify study-level characteristics associated with increased prognostic potential of the NLR. Pooled hazard ratios are highest in studies of melanoma and breast cancer and lowest in studies of brain cancer and lung cancer. Radiation as primary treatment also demonstrates a large pooled effect size as compared to other therapies. The NLR has greater prognostic value in certain cancer types and therapeutic regimens. Efforts are needed to comprehensively examine populations in which NLR has maximum prognostic power. Clinically meaningful thresholds for risk stratification should be identified within these patient subgroups to permit prospective validation of the prognostic potential of the NLR.","/content/10.1101/19011387v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011387v1.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Epidemiology

"The Effect of Altered Neural Inputs and Botulinum Neurotoxin Chemical Denervation on the Passive Biomechanical Properties of Hand and Wrist Muscles in Chronic Hemiparetic Stroke","Background and Purpose: Following a hemiparetic stroke, prolonged altered motor neuronal inputs may drive passive mechanical changes within muscle that further amplify the brain injury induced motor impairments, reducing optimal recovery. However, due to confounding factors, i.e. muscle hyperactivity and botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) chemical denervation, there is no consensus on how altered neural inputs following a stroke may affect the muscle's passive mechanical properties. Therefore, the goal of this study is to understand how passive mechanical properties of muscles adapt to prolonged altered neural inputs by minimizing and controlling for muscle hyperactivity and BoNT.
Methods: Passive torques about the wrist and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints were quantified in the paretic and non-paretic wrist/fingers of 34 individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Participants' hand impairments ranged from severe to mild and included a group who received BoNT injections. Torques were quantified with the subjects in a sleep or near-sleep state to mitigate muscle hyperactivity and EMGs were continuously monitored to ensure no muscle activity during data collection. 
Results: Our findings indicate that the passive mechanics of wrist/fingers do not substantially change following a hemiparetic stroke unless the individual previously received BoNT injections. Substantial increases in passive flexion torques were observed in individuals who had received BoNT which resulted in a decrease of up to 68 degrees in passive MCP range of motion in extension.
Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge this study is the most thorough investigation of in vivo passive elastic torques at the wrist and fingers in chronic hemiparetic stroke. The results indicate increased stiffness observed clinically and in previous studies are likely a result of muscle hyperactivity, or are the result of BoNT injections. Thus, loss of hand function post-stroke is predominately due to motor impairments post stroke suggesting future studies and rehabilitation techniques should focus on these deficits.","/content/10.1101/19011312v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011312v1.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Influence of Chinese eye exercises on myopia control in an East Asian population: a meta-analysis","Objective: The rates of myopia (-0.50 diopter), and high myopia (= -6.0 diopter) have been increasing in East Asian populations; the reasons for which may include the combinations of genetic, environment and behavioural factors. The most affected demography point to the young elite population of intellectuals produced from universities. Of the several recommendations to address the myopia epidemic, the influence of Chinese eye exercises (CEE) have been examined. However, reports have been inconsistent, prompting a meta-analysis to obtain more precise estimates. 
Methods: Eight articles were included in the meta-analysis where we operated on the hypothesis that CEE either increased or reduced myopia control. We compared the subjects that performed CEE against those that did not. We used and estimated odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the generic inverse variance method. Subgroup analysis involved quality (high/serious and low/non-serious) and frequency (> 5 times/week) of performing CEE comprised. Heterogeneity was subjected to outlier treatment which split the findings into pre- (PRO) and post- (PSO) outlier. The strength of evidence in our findings were based on high significance (Pa < 10-5), surviving the Bonferroni correction and homogeneity (I2 = 0%). Outcomes with these features comprised our core findings.
Results: Our core findings were found in the PSO overall indicating elevated myopia control (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.86, Pa = 0.0002) and CEE subgroups (Serious: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.84, Pa < 10-5; Frequent: OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45-0.68, Pa < 10-5). The low quality subgroup outcome was null in PRO (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.50-1.86, Pa = 0.92) but conveyed significantly less myopia control in PSO (OR1.57, 95% CI 1.24-2.01, Pa = 0.0002).
Conclusions: This meta-analysis found that CEE afforded 28% greater control of myopia. Enabled by outlier treatment, this finding was homogeneous and consistent. Subgroup effects elevated myopia control to 62% when CEE was done up to 5 times a week. Improper CEE performance implied reduced myopia control of up to 57%.","/content/10.1101/19011270v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011270v1.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Ophthalmology

"Impact of left ventricular assist devices and heart transplant on acute myocardial infarction and heart failure mortality and readmission measures","Abstract
Background: Concern has been raised about consequences of including patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplantation (HT) in readmission and mortality measures.
Methods: We calculated unadjusted and hospital-specific 30-day risk-standardized mortality (RSMR) and readmission (RSRR) rates for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with a primary diagnosis of AMI or HF discharged between July 2010 and June 2013. Hospitals were compared before and after excluding LVAD and HT patients. LVAD indication was measured.
Results:
For the AMI and HF cohorts, <0.2% of patients received an LVAD and <0.1% received HT in either cohort. Less than 2% of hospitals had either >6 patients who received an LVAD or, independently, had >1 HT. The AMI mortality and readmission cohorts used 1.8% and 2.8% of LVADs for semi-permanent/permanent indications, versus 73.8% and 78.0% for HF patients, respectively. The rest were for temporary/external indications.
In the AMI cohort, RSMR for hospitals without LVAD patients versus hospitals with >6 LVADs was 14.8% and 14.3%, and RSRR was 17.8% and 18.3%, respectively; the HF cohort RSMR was 11.9% and 9.7% and RSRR was 22.6% and 23.4%, respectively. In the AMI cohort, RSMR for hospitals without versus with HT patients was 14.7% and 13.9% and RSRR was 17.8% and 17.7%, respectively; in the HF cohort, RSMR was 11.9% and 11.0%, and RSRR was 22.6% and 22.6%, respectively. Estimations changed <0.1% after excluding LVAD or HT patients.
Conclusion: 
Hospitals caring for >6 patients with LVAD or >1 HT had lower RSMRs but higher RSRRs on average. Rates were insignificantly changed when these patients were excluded. LVADs were primarily for acute-care in the AMI cohort and chronic support in the HF cohort. LVAD and HT patients are a distinct group with differential care requirements and outcomes, thus should be considered separately from the rest of the HF cohort.","/content/10.1101/19011213v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011213v1.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Prospective Evaluation of a Breast Cancer Risk Model Integrating Classical Risk Factors and Polygenic Risk in 15 Cohorts from Six Countries","PURPOSE
Risk-stratified breast cancer prevention requires accurate identification of women at sufficiently different levels of risk. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of a model integrating classical risk factors and a recently developed 313-variant polygenic risk score (PRS) to predict breast cancer risk. 
METHODS
Fifteen prospective cohorts from six countries with 237,632 women (7,529 incident breast cancer patients) of European ancestry aged 19-75 years at baseline were included. Calibration of five-year risk was assessed by comparing predicted and observed proportions of cases overall and within risk categories. Risk stratification for women of European ancestry aged 50-70 years in those countries was evaluated by the proportion of women and future breast cancer cases crossing clinically-relevant risk thresholds. 
RESULTS
The model integrating classical risk factors and PRS accurately predicted five-year risk. For women younger than 50 years, median (range) expected-to-observed ratio across the cohorts was 0.94 (0.72 to 1.01) overall and 0.9 (0.7 to 1.4) at the highest risk decile. For women 50 years or older, these ratios were 1.04 (0.73 to 1.31) and 1.2 (0.7 to 1.6), respectively. The proportion of women in the general population identified above the 3% five-year risk threshold (used for recommending risk-reducing medications in the US) ranged from 7.0% in Germany (~841,000 of 12 million) to 17.7% in the US (~5.3 of 30 million). At this threshold, 14.7% of US women were re-classified by the addition of PRS to classical risk factors, identifying 12.2% additional future breast cancer cases.
CONCLUSION	
Evaluation across multiple prospective cohorts demonstrates that integrating a 313-SNP PRS into a risk model substantially improves its ability to stratify women of European ancestry for applying current breast cancer prevention guidelines.","/content/10.1101/19011171v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011171v1.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Epidemiology

"Prevalence of malnutrition and associated factors among adult patients on Antiretroviral Therapy follow up care in Jimma Medical Center, Southwest Ethiopia.","Abstract
Background: Malnutrition especially under nutrition is the main problem that is seen over people living with HIV/AIDS and can occur at any age. Multiple factors contributed to malnutrition of HIV/AIDS patients and it need immediate identification and prompt action. The objective of this study was to assess the nutritional status of patients and identify factors associated with malnutrition among HIV/AIDS patients on follow-up care in Jimma medical center, Southwest Ethiopia.
Methods: A cross-sectional study design was conducted from March-April, 2016. Data was collected retrospectively from clinical records of HIV/AIDS patients enrolled for follow up care in ART clinic from June 2010 to January 2016. Binary and multiple variable logistic regression was done to identify independent predictor of malnutrition. 
Results: Data of 971 patients were included in the study. The prevalence of under nutrition (BMI<18.5) was (36.8%) (95% CI: 33.8%-39.8%) and out of which severe malnutrition accounts 9.7%. Overweight and obese was 8.6%. Malnutrition was more likely among widowed patients (AOR=1.7, 95% CI, 1.034-2.798), patients in the WHO clinical AIDS staging of three (AOR=2.3, 95% CI, 1.392-3.693) and four (AOR=3.2, 95% CI, 1.667-5.943), patients with CD4 cell count of <200 cells/mm3 (AOR=2.0, 95% CI, 1.463-2.837) and patients with a functional status of bedridden (AOR=4.677, 95% CI, 1.761-12.419) and ambulatory (AOR=2.763, 95% CI, 1.833-4.165).   
Conclusion: Both under nutrition and overweight are prevalent among HIV/AIDS patients in Jimma Medical Center, Ethiopia. Malnutrition was significantly associated with clinical outcome of patients. Hence, nutritional assessment, care and support should be strengthened. Critical identification of malnourished patients and prompt interventions should be undertaken.","/content/10.1101/19011130v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011130v1.full.pdf","2019-11-05","HIV/AIDS

"GBA variants in REM sleep behavior disorder: a multicenter study","Objective: To study the role of GBA variants in the risk for isolated rapid-eye-movement (REM)-sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and conversion to overt neurodegeneration.
Methods: A total of 4,147 individuals were included: 1,061 iRBD patients and 3,086 controls. GBA was fully sequenced using molecular inversion probes and Sanger sequencing. We analyzed the effects of GBA variants on the risk for iRBD, age at onset (AAO) and conversion rates. 
Results: GBA variants were found in 9.5% of iRBD patients compared to 4.1% in controls (odds ratio [OR]=2.45, 95% CI=1.87-3.22, p=1x10-10). The estimated OR for mild p.N370S variant carriers was 3.69, 95% CI=1.90-7.14, p=3.5x10-5, while for severe variant carriers it was 17.55, 95% CI=2.11-145.9, p=0.0015. Carriers of severe GBA variants had an average AAO of 52.8 years, 7-8 years earlier than those with mild variants or non-carriers (p=0.029). Of the GBA variant carriers with available data, 52.5% had converted, compared to 35.6% in non-carriers (p=0.011), with a trend for faster conversion among severe GBA variant carriers. However, the results on AAO and conversion were based on small numbers and should be taken with caution. 
Conclusions: GBA variants robustly and differentially increase the risk of iRBD. The rate of conversion to neurodegeneration is also increased and may be faster among severe GBA variant carriers, although confirmation will be required in larger samples. Screening for RBD in healthy carriers of GBA variants should be studied as a potential way to identify GBA variant carriers who will develop a synucleinopathy in the future.","/content/10.1101/19010991v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010991v1.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"A panel of synapse assembly genes as a biomarker for Gliomas","Gliomas are the most common primary brain cancers. In recent years, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion have been suggested as biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of gliomas. However, these biomarkers are only effective for a part of glioma patients and thus more biomarkers are still emergently needed. Recently, an electrochemical communication between normal neurons and glioma cells by neuro-glioma synapse has been reported. Moreover, it was discovered that breast-to-brain metastasis tumor cells have pseudo synapses with neurons and these synapses were indicated to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Based on the above observations, we first curated a panel of 66 SA genes and then proposed a metric, SA score, to quantify the synapseness for each sample of 12 glioma gene expression datasets from TCGA, CGGA, and GEO. Strikingly, SA score showed excellent predictive ability for the prognosis, diagnosis, and grading of gliomas. Moreover, being compared with the two established biomarkers, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion, SA score was demonstrated independent and better predictive performance. In conclusion, this study revealed that SA genes contribute to glioma formation and development, and proposed a quantitative method, SA score, as an efficient biomarker for monitoring gliomas.","/content/10.1101/19011114v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011114v1.full.pdf","2019-11-04","Oncology

"Opening the Black Box of Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Decision Support: A Study Predicting Stroke Outcome","State-of-the-art machine learning (ML) artificial intelligence methods are increasingly leveraged in clinical predictive modeling to provide clinical decision support systems to physicians. Modern ML approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and tree boosting often perform better than more traditional methods like logistic regression. On the other hand, these modern methods yield a limited understanding of the resulting predictions. However, in the medical domain, understanding of applied models is essential, in particular, when informing clinical decision support. Thus, in recent years, interpretability methods for modern ML methods have emerged to potentially allow explainable predictions paired with high performance. To our knowledge, we present in this work the first explainability comparison of two modern ML methods, tree boosting and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), to traditional logistic regression methods using a stroke outcome prediction paradigm. Here, we used clinical features to predict a dichotomized 90 days post-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. For interpretability, we evaluated clinical features importance with regard to predictions using deep taylor decomposition for MLP, shapley values for tree boosting and model coefficients for logistic regression. With regard to performance as measured by AUC values on the test dataset, all models performed comparably: Logistic regression AUCs were 0.82, 0.82, 0.79 for three different regularization schemes; tree boosting AUC was 0.81; MLP AUC was 0.81. Importantly, the interpretability analysis demonstrated consistent results across models by rating age and stroke severity consecutively amongst the most important predictive features. For less important features, some differences were observed between the methods. Our analysis suggests that modern machine learning methods can provide explainability which is compatible with domain knowledge interpretation and traditional method rankings. Future work should focus on replication of these findings in other datasets and further testing of different explainability methods.","/content/10.1101/19010975v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010975v1.full.pdf","2019-11-04","Health Informatics

"PheWAS-ME: A web-app for interactive exploration of multimorbidity patterns in PheWAS","Summary: Electronic health records (EHRs) linked with a DNA biobank provide unprecedented opportunities to use big data for biomedical research in precision medicine. The Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) is a widely used technique for high-throughput evaluation of relationships between a set of genetic variants and a large collection of clinical phenotypes recorded in EHRs. PheWAS analyses are typically presented as static tables and charts of summary statistics obtained from statistical tests of association between pairs of a genetic variant and individual phenotypes. Comorbidities are common and typically lead to complex, multivariate gene-disease association signals that are challenging to interpret. Discovering and interrogating multimorbidity patterns and their influence in PheWAS is difficult and time- consuming. Here, we present a web application to visualize individual-level genotype and phenotype data side-by-side with PheWAS analysis results in an interactive dashboard, allowing researchers to explore multimorbidity patterns and their associations with a genetic variant of interest. We expect this application to enrich PheWAS analyses by illuminating clinical multimorbidity patterns present in the data.","/content/10.1101/19009480v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009480v2.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Health Informatics

"An Environment-Wide Study of Adult Cognitive Performance in the 23andMe Cohort","BACKGROUND: With the emergence of web-based data collection methods, large digital health cohorts offer the opportunity to conduct behavioral and epidemiologic research at an unprecedented scale. The size and breadth of such data sets enable discovery of novel associations across the phenotypic spectrum. 
METHODS: We deployed the digital symbol substitution test (DSST) online to consented 23andMe research participants 50-85 years of age. We tested cross-sectional associations between DSST performance and 824 phenotypes using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, age*sex interaction, device, time of cohort entry, and ancestry, separately among discovery (n=144,786) and replication (n=93,428) samples; additional analyses further adjusted for education. We post-stratified association estimates on age, sex, and education to adjust for discrepancies across subsamples. Leveraging the rich genetic and phenotypic data available at 23andMe, we also estimated genetic and environmental correlations between DSST and its top correlates using linkage disequilibrium score regression. 
RESULTS: 97 phenotypes were significantly (false discovery rate < 0.05) and strongly (standardized effect size > |0.5|) associated with DSST performance in the discovery phase. Of those, 60 (38 with additional adjustment for education) demonstrated both statistical significance and consistent direction of association in the replication sample. The significantly associated phenotypes largely clustered into the following categories: psychiatric traits (e.g. anxiety, ÃŸ per 1 SD = -0.74, P-value=3.9x10-169), education (e.g. highest math class completed, ÃŸ per 1 SD = 2.11, P-value <1 x 10-300), leisure activities (e.g. solitary activities like puzzles, ÃŸ per 1 SD = 1.85, P-value <1.0x10-300), social determinants (e.g. household income, ÃŸ per 1 SD = 1.20, P-value= 8.9x10-245, and lifestyle (e.g. years smoked, ÃŸ per 1 SD = -0.98, P-value= 2.2x10-78). We identified several reproducible genetic correlations between DSST and its top associated exposures (e.g. 0.48 for leisure activities like puzzles, 0.28 for years of education, and -0.24 for anxiety; all P = 7.9x10-26). For almost all exposures, genetic correlations with DSST were considerably stronger than environmental correlations. 
CONCLUSIONS: We have conducted the largest study of cognitive performance to date, building evidence supporting its correlations with many social, lifestyle, and clinical exposures. We established that the observed associations are in part underpinned by shared genetic architecture. Our study illustrates the potential of large-scale digital cohorts to contribute to epidemiologic discovery.","/content/10.1101/19009076v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009076v2.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Epidemiology

"The development of competency frameworks in healthcare professions: a scoping review.","Background
Competency frameworks serve various roles including outlining characteristics of a competent workforce, facilitating mobility, and analysing or assessing expertise. Given these roles and their relevance in the health professions, we sought to understand the methods and strategies used in the development of existing competency frameworks.

Methods
We applied the Arksey and O'Malley framework to undertake this scoping review. We searched six electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, and ERIC) and three grey literature sources (greylit.org, Trove and Google Scholar) using keywords related to competency frameworks. We screened studies for inclusion by title and abstract, and we included studies of any type that described the development of a competency framework in a healthcare profession. Two reviewers independently extracted data including study characteristics. Data synthesis was both quantitative and qualitative.

Results
Among 5,710 citations, we selected 190 for analysis. The majority of studies were conducted in medicine and nursing professions. Literature reviews and group techniques were conducted in 116 studies each (61%), and 85 (45%) outlined some form of stakeholder deliberation. We observed a significant degree of diversity in methodological strategies, inconsistent adherence to existing guidance on the selection of methods, who was involved, and based on the variation we observed in timeframes, combination, function, application and reporting of methods and strategies, there is no apparent gold standard or standardised approach to competency framework development.

Conclusions
We observed significant variation within the conduct and reporting of the competency framework development process. While some variation can be expected given the differences across and within professions, our results suggest there is some difficulty in determining whether methods were fit-for-purpose, and therefore in making determinations regarding the appropriateness of the development process. This uncertainty may unwillingly create and legitimise uncertain or artificial outcomes. There is a need for improved guidance in the process for developing and reporting competency frameworks.","/content/10.1101/19003475v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003475v2.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Medical Education

"Achieving coordinated national immunity and cholera elimination in Haiti through vaccination","Background
Cholera was introduced into Haiti in 2010. Since, there have been over 820,000 reported cases and nearly 10,000 deaths. The year 2019 has seen the lowest reported number of cases since the epidemic began. Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is safe and effective, but has generally not been seen as a primary tool for cholera elimination due to a limited period of protection and constrained supplies. Regionally, epidemic cholera is contained to the island of Hispaniola. Hence, Haiti may represent a unique opportunity to eliminate cholera by use of OCV.

Methods
We assess the probability of elimination and the potential health impact of OCV use in Haiti by leveraging simulations from four independent modeling teams. For a 10-year projection period, we compared the impact of five vaccination campaign scenarios, differing in geographic scope, vaccination coverage, and rollout duration to a status quo scenario without vaccination. Teams used common calibration data and assumptions for vaccine efficacy and vaccination scenarios, but all other model features and assumptions were determined independently.

Findings
A two-department OCV campaign proposed in Haiti's national plan for elimination had less than 50% probability of elimination across models, and only ambitious, nationwide campaigns had a high probability of reaching this goal. Despite their low probability of elimination, two-department campaigns averted a median of 13-58% of infections across models over the five years after the start of vaccination campaigns; a nationwide campaign implemented at the same coverage and rollout duration averted a median of 58-95% of infections across models.

Interpretation
Despite recent declines in cholera cases in Haiti, bold action is needed to promote elimination of cholera from the region. Large-scale cholera vaccination campaigns in Haiti offer the opportunity to synchronize nationwide immunity, providing near-term protection to the population while improvements to water and sanitation infrastructure create an environment favorable to long-term cholera elimination.","/content/10.1101/19011072v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011072v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Epidemiology

"Acute ischemic stroke alters the brain's preference for distinct dynamic connectivity states","Acute ischemic stroke disturbs healthy brain organization, prompting subsequent plasticity and reorganization to compensate for loss of specialized neural tissue and function. Static resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have already furthered our understanding of cerebral reorganization by estimating stroke-induced changes in network connectivity aggregated over the duration of several minutes. In this study, we utilized dynamic resting-state fMRI analyses to increase temporal resolution to seconds and explore transient configurations of motor network connectivity in acute stroke. To this end, we collected resting-state fMRI data of 31 acute ischemic stroke patients and 17 age-matched healthy controls. Stroke patients presented with moderate to severe hand motor deficits. By estimating dynamic connectivity within a sliding window framework, we identified three distinct connectivity configurations of motor-related networks. Motor networks were organized into three regional domains, i.e. a cortical, subcortical and cerebellar domain. Temporal connectivity patterns of stroke patients markedly diverged from those of healthy controls depending on the severity of the initial motor impairment. Moderately affected patients (n=18) spent significantly more time in a weakly connected configuration that was characterized by low levels of connectivity, both locally as well as between distant regions. In contrast, severely affected patients (n=13) showed a significant preference for transitions into a spatially segregated connectivity configuration. This configuration featured particularly high levels of local connectivity within the three regional domains as well as anti-correlated connectivity between distant networks across domains. A third connectivity configuration represented an intermediate connectivity pattern compared to the preceding two, and predominantly encompassed decreased inter-hemispheric connectivity between cortical motor networks independent of individual deficit severity. Alterations within this third configuration thus closely resembled previously reported ones originating from static resting-state fMRI studies post-stroke.
In summary, acute ischemic stroke not only prompted changes in connectivity between distinct functional networks, yet also caused severe aberrations in temporal properties of large-scale network interactions depending on the individual deficit severity. These findings offer new vistas on the dynamic neural mechanisms underlying acute neurological symptoms, cortical reorganization and treatment effects in stroke patients.","/content/10.1101/19011031v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011031v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Neurology

While the APOE2 allele is associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's dementia, it is not yet known whether APOE2 homozygotes have a particularly low risk. We generated Alzheimers dementia odds ratios and other findings in more than 5,000 clinically characterized and neuropathologically characterized Alzheimer's dementia cases and controls. APOE2/2 was associated with exceptionally low Alzheimer's dementia odds ratios compared to APOE2/3, 3/3 and 4/4, and the impact of APOE2 and APOE4 gene dose was significantly greater in the neuropathologically confirmed group than in more than 24,000 neuropathologically unconfirmed cases and controls. Finding and targeting the factors by which APOE and its variants influence Alzheimer's disease could have a major impact on the understanding, treatment and prevention of this terrible disease.","/content/10.1101/19011015v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011015v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Pathology

"Physicians learning in the workplace: use of informal feedback cues in daily practice","Purpose: We expect physicians to be lifelong learners. Learning from clinical practice is an important potential source for that learning. To support physicians in this process, a better understanding of how they learn in clinical practice is necessary. This study investigates how physicians use informal feedback as learning cues to adjust their communication from interactions with patients in the outpatient setting.
Methods: To understand how physicians use of informal feedback, we combined non-participant ethnographic observations with semi-structured interviews. We enrolled 10 respiratory physicians and observed 100 physician-patient interactions at one academic and one non-academic hospital in the Netherlands. Data collection and analysis were performed iteratively according to the principles of constructivist grounded theory. Our conceptual model describes how physicians use cues to reflect on and adjust their communication as well as to further develop their adaptive expertise.
Results: In addition to vast variations within and across patient encounters, we observed recurring patterns in physician communications in reaction to specific learning cues. Physicians had learnt to recognise and use different cues to adjust their communication in patient encounters. They established a communication repertoire based on multiple patient interactions, which many saw as learning opportunities, contributing to the development of adaptive expertise. Our findings show differences in sensitivity to recognising learning opportunities in daily practice which was further influenced by contextual, personal and interpersonal factors. Whereas some reported to have little inclination to change, others used critical incidents to fine-tune their communication repertoire, while others constantly reshaped it, seeking learning opportunities in their daily work. 
Conclusions: There is a large variation in how physicians use learning cues from daily practice. Raising awareness of experiences as potential learning opportunities might enhance their development of adaptive expertise. Learning from daily practice is a collaborative effort and requires a culture that promotes lifelong learning.","/content/10.1101/19010926v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010926v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Medical Education

"Unsupervised clustering of missense variants in the HNF1A gene using multidimensional functional data aids clinical interpretation","Background: Exome sequencing in diabetes presents a diagnostic challenge as depending on frequency, functional impact and genomic and environmental contexts, HNF1A variants can cause Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), increase type 2 diabetes risk, or be benign. A correct diagnosis matters as it informs on treatment, progression, and family risk. We describe a multi-dimensional functional dataset of 73 HNF1A missense variants identified in exomes of 12,940 individuals. Our aim was to develop an analytical framework for stratifying variants along the HNF1A phenotypic continuum to facilitate diagnostic interpretation.
Methods: HNF1A variant function was determined by 4 different molecular assays. Structure of the multi-dimensional dataset was explored using principal component analysis, k-means, and hierarchical clustering. Weights for tissue-specific isoform expression and functional domain were integrated. Functionally annotated variant subgroups were used to re-evaluate genetic diagnoses in national MODY diagnostic registries. 
Findings: HNF1A variants demonstrated a range of behaviours across the assays. The structure of the multi-parametric data was shaped primarily by transactivation. Using unsupervised learning methods, we obtained high-resolution functional clusters of the variants which separated known causal MODY variants from benign and type 2 diabetes risk variants and led to reclassification of 4% and 9% of HNF1A variants identified in the UK and Norway MODY diagnostic registries, respectively. 
Interpretation: Our proof-of-principle analyses facilitated informative stratification of HNF1A variants along the continuum, allowing improved evaluation of clinical significance, management and precision medicine in diabetes clinics. Transcriptional activity appears a superior readout supporting pursuit of transactivation-centric experimental designs for high-throughput functional screens.","/content/10.1101/19010900v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010900v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Validity of using cancer registry data for comparative effectiveness research","Purpose: Researchers often analyze cancer registry data to assess for differences in survival among cancer treatments. However, the retrospective non-random design of these analyses raise questions about study validity. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which comparative effectiveness analyses using cancer registry data produces results concordant with randomized clinical trials. 

Methods: We identified 141 randomized clinical trials referenced in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines for 8 common solid tumor types. For each trial we identified subjects from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) matching the eligibility criteria of the randomized trial. With each trial we used three Cox regression models to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival including univariable, multivariable, and propensity score adjusted models. Multivariable and propensity score analyses controlled for potential confounders including demographic, comorbidity, clinical, treatment, and tumor-related variables. Each NCDB survival analysis was defined as discordant if the HR for the NCDB analysis fell outside the 95% confidence interval of the corresponding randomized trial.

Results: NCDB analyses produced HRs for survival discordant with randomized trials in 62 (44%) univariable analyses, 43 (30%) multivariable analyses, and 51 (36%) propensity score models. NCDB analyses produced p-values discordant with randomized trials in 83 (59%) univariable analyses, 76 (54%) multivariable analyses, and 78 (55%) propensity score models. We did not identify any clinical trial characteristic associated with discordance between NCDB analyses and randomized trials including disease site, type of clinical intervention, or severity of cancer.

Conclusion: Comparative effectiveness research with cancer registry data often produces survival outcomes discordant to randomized clinical data. These findings help provide context for providers interpreting observational comparative effectiveness research in oncology.","/content/10.1101/19010876v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010876v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Oncology

"Quality of care at safety-net hospitals and the impact on pay-for-performance reimbursement","Background:
Pay-for-performance reimbursement ties hospital payments to standardized quality of care metrics. The impact of pay-for-performance reimbursement models on safety-net hospitals, which care primarily for uninsured or underinsured patients, remains poorly defined. This study evaluates how standardized quality of care metrics vary by a hospital's safety-net status, and helps us better understand the potential impact that pay-for-performance reimbursement could have on funding of safety-net hospitals.

Methods:
We identified 1,703,865 bladder, breast, cervix, colon, endometrium, gastric, lung, ovary, or rectum cancer patients treated at 1,344 hospitals diagnosed between 2004 and 2015. Safety-net burden was defined for each hospital as the percentage of uninsured or Medicaid patients cared for by that hospital. Hospitals were grouped into low-, medium-, and high-burden hospitals. We evaluated the impact of safety-net burden on concordance with 20 standardized quality of care measures, adjusting for differences in patient age, gender, stage at diagnosis, and comorbidity.

Results:
Patients seen at high-burden hospitals were more likely to be young, male, black, Hispanic, and to reside in a low-income and low-educated region. High-burden hospitals had lower adherence to 13 of 20 quality measures compared to low-burden hospitals (all p<0.05). Among the 350 high-burden hospitals, the quality measures were lowest for those caring for the highest fraction of uninsured or Medicaid patients, minority serving hospitals, and those caring for less educated patients (all p<0.001).

Discussion:
Cancer care at safety-net hospitals was associated with lower concordance to standardized quality of care measures. Under a pay-for-performance reimbursement model these lower quality of care scores could decrease payments to safety-net hospitals, potentially increasing health disparities for at-risk cancer patients.","/content/10.1101/19010843v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010843v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Oncology

"Defining predatory journals and responding to the threat they pose: a modified Delphi consensus process","Background: Posing as legitimate open access outlets, predatory journals and publishers threaten the integrity of academic publishing by not following publication best practices. Currently, there is no agreed upon definition of predatory journals, making it difficult for funders and academic institutions to generate practical guidance or policy to ensure their members do not publish in these channels.

Methods: We conducted a modified three-round Delphi survey of an international group of academics, funders, policy makers, journal editors, publishers and others, to generate a consensus definition of predatory journals and suggested ways the research community should respond to the problem. 

Results: A total of 45 participants completed the survey on predatory journals and publishers. We reached consensus on 18 items out of a total of 33, to be included in a consensus definition of predatory journals and publishers. We came to consensus on educational outreach and policy initiatives on which to focus, including the development of a single checklist to detect predatory journals and publishers, and public funding to support research in this general area. We identified technological solutions to address the problem: a 'one-stop-shop' website to consolidate information on the topic and a 'predatory journal research observatory' to identify ongoing research and analysis about predatory journals/publishers.

Conclusions: In bringing together an international group of diverse stakeholders, we were able to use a modified Delphi process to inform the development of a definition of predatory journals and publishers. This definition will help institutions, funders and other stakeholders generate practical guidance on avoiding predatory journals and publishers.","/content/10.1101/19010850v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010850v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Medical Education

"PET markers of tau and neuroinflammation are co-localized in progressive supranuclear palsy","Background: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is associated with tau-protein aggregation and neuroinflammation, but it remains unclear whether these pathogenic processes are related in vivo. 
Objectives: We examined the relationship between tau pathology and microglial activation using [18F]AV-1451 (indexing tau burden) and [11C]PK11195 (microglial activation) PET in n=17 patients with PSP-Richardson's syndrome. 
Methods: Non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) for each ligand was quantified in 83 regions of interest (ROIs). [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK11195 BPND values were correlated across all ROIs. The anatomical patterns of [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK11195 binding co-localization was determined across sets of regions derived from principal component analyses (PCAs). Finally, PCA-derived brain patterns of tau pathology and neuroinflammation were linked to clinical severity.
Results: [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK11195 binding were positively related across all ROIs (r=0.577, p<0.0001). PCAs identified four components for each ligand, reflecting the relative expression of tau pathology or neuroinflammation in distinct groups of brain regions. Positive associations between [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK11195 components were found in sub-cortical (r=0.769, p<0.0001) and cortical components (r=0.836, p<0.0001). PCA-derived components reflecting tau burden (r=0.599, p=0.011) and neuroinflammation (r=0.713, p=0.001) in sub-cortical areas related to disease severity.
Conclusions: We show that tau pathology and neuroinflammation co-localize in PSP, and that individual differences in subcortical tau pathology and neuroinflammation are linked to clinical severity. Although longitudinal studies are needed to determine how these molecular pathologies are causally linked, we suggest that the combination of tau- and immune-oriented strategies may be useful for effective disease-modifying treatments in PSP.","/content/10.1101/19010702v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010702v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Neurology

"Effect of indoor air pollution on infant and child-mortality in Myanmar: Evidence from the first Demographic and Health Survey","Background:

Indoor air pollution (IAP) from solid fuels for cooking has been considered as a public health threat, particularly for women and children in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). We investigated the effects of solid fuel use (SFU) on neonatal, infant and under-five child mortality in Myanmar.  

Materials and Methods:

We used data from Myanmars first Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2016. The sample consists of ever-married mothers with under-five children in the household (n=3249). We calculated the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) to investigate the effects of SFU on neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality using multivariable logistic regression model accounting for survey weight and clustering. Additional analysis was conducted using an augmented measure of the exposure to IAP accounting for both SFU and the location of cooking (high exposure, moderate, and unexposed). 

Results:

The prevalence of SFU was 79.0%, and the neonatal, infant and the under-five mortality rates were 26, 45 and 49 per 1,000 live births, respectively. The odds of infant (aOR 2.17, 95% CI: 1.21, 3.88) and under-five child mortality (aOR 2.22, 95% CI: 1.24, 3.95) were higher in households with SFU compared with households with clean fuel use. When applying an augmented measure of exposure to IAP by incorporating both SFU and the kitchens location, the likelihood of infant and under-five mortality was higher among moderately and highly exposed children compared to unexposed children with similar trends. Neonatal mortality was not associated with both SFU and levels of exposure to IAP.

Conclusion:

Infants and under-five children are at higher risk of mortality from exposure to IAP. The findings suggest that the risk of infants and under-five child mortality may be reduced by increasing access to clean cookstoves and clean fuels in LMICs, especially in Myanmar.","/content/10.1101/19010801v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010801v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Epidemiology

"A phenome-wide association study of four syndromic genes reveals pleiotropic effects of common and rare variants in the general population","The clinical evaluation of a genetic syndrome relies upon recognition of a characteristic pattern of signs or symptoms to guide targeted genetic testing for confirmation of the diagnosis. However, individuals displaying a few phenotypes of a complex syndrome may not meet criteria for clinical diagnosis or genetic testing. Here, we present a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach to systematically explore pleiotropy of common and rare alleles in genes associated with four well-described syndromic diseases (Alagille (AS), Marfan (MS), DiGeorge (DS), and Noonan (NS) syndromes) in the general population.
Using human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms, we systematically mapped 60 phenotypes related to AS, MS, DS and NS in 337,198 unrelated white British from the UK Biobank (UKBB) based on their hospital admission records, self-administrated questionnaires, and physiological measurements. We performed logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, and the first 5 genetic principal components, for each phenotype and each variant in the target genes (JAG1, TBX1, FBN1, PTPN11, NOTCH2, and MAP2K1) and performed a gene burden testing. 
Overall, we observed multiple phenotype-genotype correlations, such as the association between variation in JAG1, FBN1, PTPN11 and SOS2 with diastolic and systolic blood pressure; and pleiotropy among multiple variants in syndromic genes. For example, rs11066309 in PTPN11 was significantly associated with a lower body mass index, an increased risk of hypothyroidism and a smaller size for gestational age, all in concordance with NS-related phenotypes. Similarly, rs589668 in FBN1 was associated with an increase in body height and blood pressure, and a reduced body fat percentage as observed in Marfan syndrome. 
Our findings suggest that the spectrum of associations of common and rare variants in genes involved in syndromic diseases can be extended to individual phenotypes within the general population.","/content/10.1101/19010736v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010736v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Impact of Radiation on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Resectable Esophageal Cancer","Purpose:   
Preoperative radiation therapy improves outcomes for operable esophageal cancer patients, though the proximity of the heart to the esophagus puts patients at risk of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease. This study characterizes the impact of radiation therapy and different radiation techniques on cardiovascular morbidity among a large cohort of esophageal cancer patients. 

Methods: 
We identified 1,125 Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed between 2000 and 2011 with esophageal cancer who received surgery alone, or surgery preceded by either preoperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation. We used Medicare claims to identify severe adverse cardiovascular events in the perioperative and postoperative periods. Multivariable logistic regression and Fine-Gray models were used to determine the effect of pre-surgery treatment on the risk of perioperative and postoperative cardiovascular disease.

Results:  
Preoperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation did not significantly increase the risk of perioperative cardiovascular complications compared to surgery alone. Patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation had a 36% increased risk of having a postoperative cardiovascular event compared to patients treated with surgery alone (subdistribution hazard ratio [SDHR] 1.36; p=0.035). There was no significant increase in cardiovascular events among patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy (SDHR 1.18; p=0.40). Among patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation, those receiving intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) had a 68% decreased risk of having a cardiovascular event compared to patients receiving conventional radiation (SDHR 0.32; p=0.007). 

Conclusions: 
This study demonstrates an increased risk of cardiovascular complications among operative esophageal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation, though these risks might be reduced with more cardioprotective radiation techniques such as IMRT.","/content/10.1101/19010835v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010835v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Oncology

"Polygenic risk scores predict diabetic complications and their response to therapy","Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular and renal complications, but early risk prediction can lead to timely intervention and better outcomes. Through summary statistics of meta-analyses of published genome-wide association studies performed in over 1.2 million of individuals, we combined 9 PRS gathering genomic variants associated to cardiovascular and renal diseases and their key risk factors into one logistic regression model, to predict micro- and macrovascular endpoints of diabetes. Its clinical utility in predicting complications of diabetes was tested in 4098 participants with diabetes of the ADVANCE trial followed during a period of 10 years and replicated it in three independent non-trial cohorts. The prediction model adjusted for ethnicity, sex, age at onset and diabetes duration, identified the top 30% of ADVANCE participants at 3.1-fold increased risk of major micro- and macrovascular events (p=6.3x10-21 and p=9.6x10-31, respectively) and at 4.4-fold (p=6.8x10-33) increased risk of cardiovascular death compared to the remainder of T2D subjects. While in ADVANCE overall, combined intensive therapy of blood pressure and glycaemia decreased cardiovascular mortality by 24%, the prediction model identified a high-risk group in whom this therapy decreased mortality by 47%, and a low risk group in whom the therapy had no discernable effect. Patients with high PRS had the greatest absolute risk reduction with a number needed to treat of 12 to prevent one cardiovascular death over 5 years. This novel polygenic prediction model identified people with diabetes at low and high risk of complications and improved targeting those at greater benefit from intensive therapy while avoiding unnecessary intensification in low-risk subjects.","/content/10.1101/19010785v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010785v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances and bone mineral density: results from the Bayesian weighted quantile sum regression","Background: Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are chemicals, detected in 95% of Americans, that induce osteotoxicity and modulate hormones thereby influencing bone health. Previous studies found associations between individual PFAS and bone mineral density but did not analyze their combined effects. 
Objective: To extend weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to a Bayesian framework (BWQS) and determine the association between a mixture of serum PFAS and mineral density in lumbar spine, total and neck femur in 499 adults from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Methods: We used BWQS to assess the combined association of nine PFAS, as a mixture, with bone mineral density in adults. As secondary analyses, we focused on vulnerable populations (men over 50 years and postmenopausal women). Analyses were weighted according to NHANES weights and were adjusted for socio-demographic factors. Sensitivity analyses included bone mineral density associations with individual compounds and results from WQS regressions. 
Results: The mean age was 55 years old (Standard Error [SE]=1) with average spine, total and neck femur mineral densities of 1.01 (SE=0.01), 0.95 (SE=0.01), and 0.78 (SE=0.01) gm/cm2, respectively. PFAS mixture levels showed no evidence of association with mineral density (spine: Beta=-0.004; 95% credible interval [CrI]=-0.04, 0.04; total femur: Beta=0.002; 95%CrI=-0.04, 0.05; femur neck: Beta=0.005; 95%CrI=-0.03, 0.04) in the overall population. Results were also null in vulnerable populations. Findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions: We introduced a Bayesian extension of WQS and found no evidence of the association between PFAS mixture and bone mineral density.","/content/10.1101/19010710v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010710v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Epidemiology

"Determinants of normal haemoglobin concentration among children in Ghana: a positive deviance analysis of nationally representative cross-sectional survey data","Anaemia among children under 5, is a public health problem of serious concern. In Ghana, 8 out of every 10 children are anaemic. This study employed a novel approach to investigate the determinants of normal haemoglobin (Hb) concentration among children aged 6 to 59 months, using data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys. The results showed that a year change in maternal education was positively associated with normal Hb concentration. Children of non-anaemic mothers were 1.67 (CI=1.32, 2.10; P<.001) times more likely to have normal Hb concentration relative to children of anaemic mothers. Compared to mothers who had less than 4 antenatal care (ANC) visits, mothers who had at least 4 ANC visits increased the odds of their children having a normal Hb concentration by 1.62 (CI=1.09, 2.40; P<.018). Children living in middle and rich households had respectively 1.48 (CI=1.06, 2.07; p<.021) and 1.59 (CI=1.08, 2.33; p<.018) increased odds of having a normal Hb concentration relative to those living in poor households. Maternal education, anaemia, ANC attendance, and household wealth index are strong determinants of normal Hb concentration among children in Ghana. Strategies aimed at addressing childhood anaemia should take into account maternal anaemia, education, poverty and ANC attendance.","/content/10.1101/19010769v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010769v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Nutrition

"Predictive approaches to heterogeneous treatment effects: a systematic review","Background: Recent evidence suggests that there is often substantial variation in the benefits and harms across a trial population. We aimed to identify regression modeling approaches that assess heterogeneity of treatment effect within a randomized clinical trial.
Methods:  We performed a literature review using a broad search strategy, complemented by suggestions of a technical expert panel.
Results: The approaches are classified into 3 categories: 1) Risk-based methods (11 papers) use only prognostic factors to define patient subgroups, relying on the mathematical dependency of the absolute risk difference on baseline risk; 2) Treatment effect modeling methods (9 papers) use both prognostic factors and treatment effect modifiers to explore characteristics that interact with the effects of therapy on a relative scale. These methods couple data-driven subgroup identification with approaches to prevent overfitting, such as penalization or use of separate data sets for subgroup identification and effect estimation. 3) Optimal treatment regime methods (12 papers) focus primarily on treatment effect modifiers to classify the trial population into those who benefit from treatment and those who do not. Finally, we also identified papers which describe model evaluation methods (4 papers). 
Conclusion: Three classes of approaches were identified to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect.  Methodological research, including both simulations and empirical evaluations, is required to compare the available methods in different settings and to derive well-informed guidance for their application in RCT analysis.","/content/10.1101/19010827v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010827v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Epidemiology

"Egocentric Sexual Networks of Men Who Have Sex with Men in the United States: Results from the ARTnet Study","In this paper, we present an overview and descriptive results from the first egocentric network study of MSM from across the United States (U.S.): the ARTnet study. ARTnet was designed to support prevention research for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that are transmitted across partnership networks. ARTnet implemented a population-based egocentric network study design that sampled egos from the target population and asked them to report on the number, attributes, and timing of their sexual partnerships. Such data provide the foundation needed for estimating and simulating stochastic network models that are used for disease projection and intervention planning. ARTnet collected data online from 2017 to 2019, with a final sample of 4904 participants who reported on 16198 sexual partnerships. The analytic aims of the study were to characterize the joint distribution of three network parameters needed for modeling: degree distributions, assortative mixing, and partnership length, with heterogeneity by partnership type (main, casual and one-time), demography, and geography. Participants had an average of 1.19 currently active partnerships (""mean degree""), which was higher for casual partnerships (0.74) than main partnerships (0.45). The mean rate of one-time partnership acquisition was 0.16 per week (8.5 partners per year). Main partnerships lasted 272.5 weeks on average, while casual partnerships lasted 133.0 weeks. There was strong but heterogenous assortative mixing by race/ethnicity for all groups. The mean absolute age difference was 9.5 years, with main partners differing by 6.3 years compared to 10.8 years for casual partners. Our analysis suggests that MSM may be at sustained risk for HIV/STI acquisition and transmission through high network degree of sexual partnerships. The ARTnet network study provides a robust and reproducible foundation for understanding the dynamics of HIV/STI epidemiology among U.S. MSM and supporting the implementation science that seeks to address persistent challenges in HIV/STI prevention.","/content/10.1101/19010579v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010579v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Epidemiology

"DNA methylation outlier burden, health and ageing in Generation Scotland and the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936.","DNA methylation outlier burden has been suggested as a potential marker of biological age. An outlier is typically defined as DNA methylation levels at any one CpG site that are three times beyond the inter-quartile range from the 25th or 75th percentiles compared to the rest of the population. DNA methylation outlier burden (the number of such outlier sites per individual) increases exponentially with age. However, these findings have been observed in small samples. Here, we showed an association between age and log10-transformed DNA methylation outlier burden in a large cross-sectional cohort, the Generation Scotland Family Health Study (N=7,010, ÃŸ=0.0091, p<2x10-16), and in two longitudinal cohort studies, the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 (N=430, ÃŸ=0.033, p=7.9x10-4) and 1936 (N=898, ÃŸ=7.9x10-3, p=0.074). Significant confounders of both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between outlier burden and age included white blood cell proportions, BMI, smoking, and batch effects. In Generation Scotland, the increase in epigenetic outlier burden with age was not purely an artefact of an increase in DNA methylation level variability with age (epigenetic drift). Log10-transformed DNA methylation outlier burden in Generation Scotland was not related to self-reported, or family history of, age-related diseases and it was not heritable (SNP-based heritability of 4.4%, p=0.18). Finally, DNA methylation outlier burden was not significantly related to survival in either of the Lothian Birth Cohorts individually but it was in a meta-analysis (HRmeta=1.12; 95%CImeta=[1.02; 1.21]; pmeta=0.021). These findings suggest that, while it does not associate with ageing-related health outcomes, DNA methylation outlier burden does track chronological ageing and may also relate to survival. DNA methylation outlier burden may thus be useful as a marker of biological ageing.","/content/10.1101/19010728v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010728v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Optimal Pharmacological Management and Prevention of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis (GIOP): Protocol for a Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis","Introduction
Glucocorticoid (GC) administration is an effective therapy commonly used in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, the use of GC can give rise to serious complications. The main detrimental side effect of GC therapy is significant bone loss, resulting in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP).

There are a variety of treatments available for preventing and managing GIOP; however, without clearly defined guidelines, it can be very difficult for physicians to choose the optimal therapy for their patients. Previous network meta-analyses (NMAs) and meta-analyses did not include all available RCT trials, or only performed pairwise comparisons. We present a protocol for a NMA that incorporates all available RCT patient data to provide the most comprehensive ranking of all available GIOP treatments in terms of their ability to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and decrease fracture incidences among adult patients undergoing GC treatments.

Methods and Analysis
We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Chinese literature sources (CNKI, CQVIP, Wanfang Data, Wanfang Med Online) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which fit our criteria. RCTs that evaluate different antiresorptive regimens taken by adult patients undergoing GC therapy during the study or had taken GC for at least 3 months in the year prior to study commencement with lumbar spine BMD, femoral neck BMD, total hip BMD, vertebral fracture incidences and/or non-vertebral fracture incidences as outcomes will be selected. 

We will perform title/abstract and full-text screening as well as data extraction in duplicate. Risk of bias (ROB) will be evaluated in duplicate for each study, and the quality of evidence will be examined using CINeMA in accordance to the GRADE framework. We will use R and gemtc to perform the NMA. We will report BMD results as weighted mean differences (WMDs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs), and we will report fracture incidences as odds ratios. We will use the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) scores to provide numerical estimations of the rankings of interventions.

Ethics and Dissemination
The study will not require ethical approval. The findings of the NMA will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences. We aim to produce the most comprehensive quantitative analysis regarding the management of GIOP. Our analysis should be able to provide physicians and patients with an up-to-date recommendation for pharmacotherapies in reducing incidences of bone loss and fractures associated with GIOP.

"Seven Decades of Chemotherapy Clinical Trials: A Pan-Cancer Social Network Analysis","Background: Clinical trials establish the standard of care for cancer and other diseases. While social network analysis has been applied to basic sciences, the social component of clinical trial research is not well characterized. We examined the social network of cancer clinical trialists and its dynamic development over more than 70 years, including the roles of subspecialization and gender in relation to traditional and network-based metrics of productivity.
Methods: We conducted a social network analysis of authors publishing chemotherapy-based prospective trials from 1946-2018, based on the curated knowledge base HemOnc.org, examining: 1) network density; 2) modularity; 3) assortativity; 4) betweenness centrality; 5) PageRank; and 6) the proportion of co-authors sharing the same primary cancer subspecialty designation. Individual author impact and productive period were analyzed as a function of gender and subspecialty.
Findings: From 1946-2018, the network grew to 29,197 authors and 697,084 co-authors. While 99.4% of authors were directly or indirectly connected as of 2018, the network had very few connections and was very siloed by cancer subspecialty. Small numbers of individuals were highly connected and had disproportionate impact (scale-free effects). Women were under-represented and likelier to have lower impact, shorter productive periods (P<0.001 for both comparisons), less centrality, and a greater proportion of co-authors in their same subspecialty. The past 30 years were characterized by a trend towards increased authorship by women, with new author parity anticipated in 2032. However, women remain a distinct minority of first/last authors, with parity not anticipated for 50+ years.
Interpretation: The network of cancer clinical trialists is best characterized as a strategic or ""mixed-motive"" network, with cooperative and competitive elements influencing its appearance. Network effects e.g., low centrality, which may limit access to high-profile individuals, likely contribute to ongoing disparities.

"Predicting Current Juul use among Emerging Adults through Twitter Feeds","Introduction: Can we predict whether someone uses Juul based on their social media activities? This is the central premise of the effort reported in this paper. Several recent social media-related studies on Juul use tend to focus on the characterization of Juul-related messages on social media. In this study, we assess the potential in using machine learning methods to automatically identify whether an individual uses Juul (past 30-day usage) based on their Twitter data.
Methods: We obtained a collection of 588 instances, for training and testing, of Juul use patterns (along with associated Twitter handles) via survey responses of college students. With this data, we built and tested supervised machine learning models based on linear and deep learning algorithms with textual, social network (friends and followers), and hand-crafted features. 
Results: The linear model with textual and follower network features performed best with a precision-recall trade-off such that precision (PPV) is 57% at 24% recall (sensitivity). Hence, at least every other user flagged by our model is expected to be a Juul user. Additionally, our results indicate that social network features tend to have a large impact (positive) on predictive performance.
Conclusion: There are enough predictive signals from social feeds for supervised modeling of Juul use, even with limited training data, implying that such models are highly beneficial to very focused intervention campaigns. Moreover, this initial success indicates potential for more involved automated surveillance of Juul use based on social media data, including Juul usage patterns, nicotine dependency, and risk awareness.","/content/10.1101/19010553v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010553v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Health Informatics

"Our culture prohibits some things: Qualitative inquiry into how sociocultural context influences the scale up of community-based injectable contraceptives in Nigeria","Objectives: To explore how sociocultural factors may support or impede the adoption of community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives in Nigeria.
Design: A qualitative study based on a grounded theory approach was conducted through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions.
Setting: Most participants lived in Gombe State, North East Nigeria. Other participants were from Ibadan (South West) and Abuja (Federal capital territory).
Participants: Through seven key informant interviews, 15 in-depth interviews and 10 focus group discussions, 102 participants were involved in the study.
Methods: This study, conducted in 2016 was part of a larger study on scale up of community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives. Qualitative data were collected from traditional and religious leaders, health workers and community members. The data were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using a thematic framework method.
Results: Sociocultural challenges to scale up included patriarchy and men fear of losing control over their spouses, traditional and religious beliefs about fertility, and myths about contraceptives and family planning. As a result of deep-rooted beliefs that children are divine blessings and that procreation should not be regulated, participants described a subtle resistance to uptake of injectable contraceptives. Since Gombe is largely a patriarchal society, male involvement emerged as important to the success of meaningful innovation uptake. Community leaders largely described their participation in the scale up process as active, although they also identified scope for further involvement and recognition.
Conclusion: Scale up is more than setting up health sector implementing structures, training health workers and getting innovation supplies, but also requires preparedness which includes paying attention to complex contextual issues. This requires the health system and those who work in it, to move beyond a narrow health comfort zone by actively engaging with, and learning from, those who are leading, caring for and living in, the community.","/content/10.1101/19010587v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010587v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Health Policy

"Association Between Tuberculosis and Depression on Negative Outcomes of Tuberculosis Treatment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Background: Depression is a common comorbidity of tuberculosis (TB) and is associated with poor adherence to treatment of multiple disorders. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the existing evidence on the relationship between depression and negative outcomes of TB treatment.
Methods: We systematically reviewed studies that evaluated depressive symptoms (DS) directly or indirectly through psychological distress (PD) and measured negative treatment outcomes of drug-sensitive pulmonary TB, defined as death, loss to follow-up, or non-adherence. Sources included PubMed, Global Health Library, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science from inception to August 2019.
Results: Of the 2,970 studies initially identified, eight articles were eligible for inclusion and two were used for the primary outcome meta-analysis. We found a strong association between DS and negative TB treatment outcomes (OR=4.26; CI95%:2.33-7.79; I2=0%). DS were also associated with loss to follow-up (OR=8.70; CI95%:6.50-11.64; I2=0%) and death (OR=2.85; CI95%:1.52-5.36; I2=0%). Non-adherence was not associated with DS and PD (OR=1.34; CI95%:0.70-2.72; I2=94.36) or PD alone (OR=0.92; CI95%:0.81-1.05; I2=0%).
Conclusions: DS are associated with the negative TB treatment outcomes of death and loss to follow-up. Considerable heterogeneity exists in the definition of depression and outcomes such as non-adherence across the limited number of studies on this topic.","/content/10.1101/19010538v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010538v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Does Smoking Cause Lower Educational Attainment and General Cognitive Ability? Triangulation of causal evidence using multiple study designs","Objectives: Observational epidemiological studies have found associations between smoking and both poorer cognitive ability and lower educational attainment; however, evaluating causality is more challenging. We used two complementary methods to attempt to ascertain whether smoking causes poorer cognitive ability and lower educational attainment.

Design: A cohort study (Study One) and a two-sample Mendelian randomization study using publicly-available summary statistics (Study Two).

Setting: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a birth-cohort study based in Bristol, United Kingdom, and general population samples from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

Participants: Up to 12,004 young people in ALSPAC (complete case analysis N = 2,107) (Study One and Study Two), and summary statistics from three previously published GWAS (not individual-level data) (Study Two).

Main outcome measures: Cognitive ability at age 15 (assessed via the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence) and educational attainment at age 16 (assessed via school records) (Study One), and educational attainment (measured as years in education) and fluid intelligence from previously published GWAS (Study Two).

Results: In Study One, heaviness of smoking at age 15 was associated with lower cognitive ability at age 15 and lower educational attainment at age 16. Adjustment for potential confounders and earlier cognitive ability or educational attainment attenuated findings although evidence of an association remained (e.g., fully adjusted cognitive ability beta -0.736, 95% CI -1.238 to -0.233, P = 0.004; fully adjusted educational attainment beta -1.254, 95% CI -1.597 to -0.911, P < 0.001). Comparable results were found in sensitivity analyses of multiply imputed data. In Study Two, two-sample Mendelian randomization indicated that both smoking initiation and lifetime smoking lower educational attainment and cognitive ability (e.g., smoking initiation to educational attainment inverse-variance weighted MR beta -0.197, 95% CI -0.223, -0.171, P = 1.78 x 10-49). Educational attainment results were robust to various sensitivity analyses, while cognition analyses were less so.

Conclusions: Our results provide evidence consistent with a causal effect of smoking on lower educational attainment, although were less consistent for cognitive ability. The triangulation of evidence from observational and Mendelian randomisation methods is an important strength for causal inference.","/content/10.1101/19009365v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009365v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Epidemiology

"Aggregating Multiple Real-World Data Sources using a Patient-Centered Health Data Sharing Platform: an 8-week Cohort Study among Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery or Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation","Real-world data sources, including electronic health records (EHR) and personal digital device data, are increasingly available, but are often siloed and cannot be easily integrated for clinical, research, or regulatory purposes. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 60 patients undergoing bariatric surgery or catheter-based atrial fibrillation ablation at two U.S. tertiary care hospitals, testing the feasibility of using a patient-centered health data sharing platform to obtain and aggregate health data from multiple sources. We successfully obtained EHR data for all patients at both hospitals, as well as from 10 additional health systems, which were successfully aggregated with pharmacy data obtained for patients using CVS or Walgreens pharmacies, personal digital device data from activity monitors, digital weight scales, and single-lead ECGs, and patient-reported outcome measure data obtained through surveys to assess post-procedure recovery and disease-specific symptoms. A patient-centered health data sharing platform successfully aggregated data from multiple sources.","/content/10.1101/19010348v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010348v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Health Informatics

"PARP1/2 imaging with 18F-PARPi in patients with head and neck cancer","Purpose. We performed a first-in-human clinical trial. The aim of this study was to determine safety and feasibility of PET imaging with 18F-PARPi in patients with head and neck cancer. 

Patients and Methods. Eleven patients (age 49 to 86 years) with newly diagnosed or recurrent oral and oropharyngeal cancer were injected intravenously with 18F-PARPi (331 Â± 42 MBq) and dynamic PET/CT imaging was performed between 0 min and 25 min post-injection. Static PET/CT scans were obtained at 30 min, 60 min and 120 min p.i. Blood samples for tracer concentration and metabolite analysis were collected. Blood pressure, ECG, oxygen levels, clinical chemistry and CBC were obtained before and after administration of 18F-PARPi. 

Results. 18F-PARPi was well-tolerated by all patients without any safety concerns. Of the 11 patients included in the analysis, 18F-PARPi had focal uptake in all primary lesions (n = 10, SUVmax  = 2.8 Â± 1.2) and all 18F-FDG positive lymph nodes (n = 34). 18F-PARPi uptake was seen in 18F-FDG negative lymph nodes of three patients (n = 6). Focal uptake of tracer in primary and metastatic lesions was corroborated by CT alone or in combination with 18F-FDG. Contrast for 18F-PARPi and 18F-FDG was comparable (SUVmax(lesion)/SUVmax(genioglossus) = 3.3 and 3.0, respectively; p = 0.23), and SUVmax values for 18F-PARPi were less variable compared to 18F-FDG (1.3 versus 6.0, p = 0.001).

Conclusions. Imaging of head and neck cancer with 18F-PARPi is feasible and safe. 18F-PARPi detects primary and metastatic lesions, and retention in tumors is longer than in healthy tissues.","/content/10.1101/19009381v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009381v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Radiology and Imaging

"Maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and risk of congenital heart disease in fetus","Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an important enzyme involved in folate metabolism, DNA synthesis and methylation. A number of studies have examined the association of maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism with congenital heart disease (CHD) susceptibility; however, the conclusions were contradictory. To clarify the influence of maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism on CHD, a meta-analysis of seventeen case-control studies was carried out. Four electronic databases - Pubmed, Google Scholars, Elsevier and Springer Link were searched upto June, 2018 for suitable articles. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to evaluate the association. Meta-analysis was performed by Mix  and MetaAnalyst programs.
The results of meta-analysis suggested that except co-dominant model, maternal A1298C polymorphism is risk for  CHD in fetus using overall comparisons in four genetic models (C vs. A: OR= 1.19, 95% CI= 1.00-1.41, p= 0.04; CC+AC vs. AA: OR= 1.19, 95% CI= 0.97-1.4, p= 0.04; CC vs. AA: OR= 1.46, 95% CI= 1.00-2.13, p= 0.04; AC vs. AA OR= 1.13, 95% CI=0.93-1.36, p= 0.23; CC vs. AC+AA: OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.1-1.6, p=0.01). Publication bias was absent using four genetic models. In conclusion, results of present meta-analysis showed significant association between maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and CHD risk.","/content/10.1101/19010298v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010298v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Epidemiology

"Real-time Estimation of Disease Activity in Emerging Outbreaks using Internet Search Information","Understanding the behavior of emerging disease outbreaks in, or ahead of, real-time could help healthcare officials better design interventions to mitigate impacts on affected populations. Most healthcare-based disease surveillance systems, however, have significant inherent reporting delays due to data collection, aggregation, and distribution processes. Recent work has shown that machine learning methods leveraging a combination of traditionally collected epidemiological information and novel Internet-based data sources, such as disease-related Internet search activity, can produce meaningful ""nowcasts"" of disease incidence ahead of healthcare-based estimates, with most successful case studies focusing on endemic and seasonal diseases such as influenza and dengue. Here, we apply similar computational methods to emerging outbreaks in geographic regions where no historical presence of the disease of interest has been observed. By combining limited available historical epidemiological data available with disease-related Internet search activity, we retrospectively estimate disease activity in five recent outbreaks weeks ahead of traditional surveillance methods. We find that the proposed computational methods frequently provide useful real-time incidence estimates that can help fill temporal data gaps resulting from surveillance reporting delays. How- ever, the proposed methods are limited by issues of sample bias and skew in search query volumes, perhaps as a result of media coverage.","/content/10.1101/19010470v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010470v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Health Informatics

"Long-term retention on antiretroviral therapy among infants, children, adolescents and adults in Malawi: A cohort study","Objectives: We examine long-term retention of adults, adolescents and children on antiretroviral therapy under different HIV treatment guidelines in Malawi.
Design: Prospective cohort study.
Setting and participants: Adults and children starting ART between 2005 and 2015 in 21 health facilities in southern Malawi.
Methods: We used survival analysis to assess retention at clinic level, Cox regression to examine risk factors for loss to follow up, and competing risk analysis to assess long-term outcomes of people on antiretroviral therapy (ART).
Results: We included 132,274 individuals in our analysis, totalling 270,256 person years of follow up (PYFU; median per patient 1.3, interquartile range (IQR) 0.26-3.1), 62% were female and the median age was 32 years. Retention on ART was lower in the first year on ART compared to subsequent years for all guideline periods and age groups. Infants (0-3 years), adolescents and young adults (15-24 years) were at highest risk of LTFU. Comparing the different calendar periods of ART initiation we found that retention improved initially, but remained stable thereafter.
Conclusion: Even though the number of patients and the burden on health care system increased substantially during the study period of rapid ART expansion, retention on ART improved in the early years of ART provision, but gains in retention were not maintained over 5 years on ART. Reducing high attrition in the first year of ART should remain a priority for ART programs, and so should addressing poor retention among adolescents, young adults and men.","/content/10.1101/19010322v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010322v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Epidemiology

"Elevated heart rate after non-cardiac surgery: post-hoc analysis of a prospective observational cohort study","Background: Elevated heart rate (HR) is associated with accelerated mortality and independently predicts poorer outcomes in patients discharged from hospital after myocardial infarction and/or heart failure. We examined whether resting HR measured within 24 hours of hospital discharge following elective non-cardiac surgery was elevated compared to preoperative values. We also investigated the relationship between changes in HR and autonomic function associated with morbidity after surgery.
Methods: We conducted a post-hoc analysis of HR data obtained in a prospective observational cohort study of patients >18years in whom serial Holter-based measurements of cardiac autonomic activity were made before, and for 48h after, surgery. The primary outcome was absolute discharge HR (beats minute-1), recorded at rest before hospital discharge. We examined the association between quartiles of discharge HR and autonomic measures (time/frequency domain heart rate variability) associated with morbidity (defined by the Postoperative Morbidity Survey).
Results: In 157 patients (66 (42%) male; age 67(9) years), HR at hospital discharge (range: 53-122) increased by 5 beats minute-1 (95%CI:3-7;p<0.001) compared to preoperative values. Patients in the upper quartile of discharge HR (>87bpm) were more likely to sustain pulmonary (odds ratio (OR):2.18 (95%CI:1.07-4.44);p=0.03) and infectious (OR:2.31 (95%CI:1.13-4.75);p=0.02) morbidity within seven days of surgery, compared to lower quartiles. Pulmonary/infectious morbidity was associated with loss of cardiac vagal activity. 
Conclusions: Heart rate on discharge from hospital following major elective non-cardiac surgery is frequently elevated and is promoted by morbidity associated with reductions in cardiac vagal activity.","/content/10.1101/19009530v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009530v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Anesthesia

"Predicting Clinical Dementia Rating Using Blood RNA Levels","INTRODUCTION: The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is commonly used to assess cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients.
METHODS: We divided 741 participants with blood microarray data in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) into three groups based on their most recent CDR assessment: cognitive normal (CDR=0), mild dementia (CDR=0.5), and probable AD (CDR=1.0). We then used machine learning to predict cognitive status using only blood RNA levels.
RESULTS: One chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) probe was significant. By combining nonsignificant probes with p-values less than 0.1, we averaged 87.87 (s = 1.02)% predictive accuracy in classifying the three groups, compared to a 55.46% baseline for this study.
DISCUSSION: We identified one significant probe in CLIC1. However, CLIC1 levels alone were not sufficient to determine dementia status. We propose that combining individually suggestive, but nonsignificant, blood RNA levels can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy.","/content/10.1101/19009092v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009092v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Implicit and explicit motor learning interventions have similar effects on walking speed in people after stroke: a randomized controlled single blind trial","Background: Therapists may use (more) implicit or (more) explicit motor learning approaches to facilitate motor skill learning of stroke patients. The use of implicit motor learning approaches has shown promising results in healthy populations.
Objective: To assess whether an implicit motor learning walking intervention is more effective compared to an explicit motor learning walking intervention delivered at home with regard to walking speed in people after stroke in the chronic phase of recovery.
Design: Randomized controlled single blind trial.
Setting: Home environment. 
Patients: 79 people in the chronic phase after stroke (66.4Â±11.0 years; 70.1Â±64.3 months after stroke; walking speed 0.7Â±0.3 m/s; Berg Balance Scale score 44.5Â±9.5) were randomly assigned to an implicit (n=39) or explicit (n=41) group.
Intervention: Analogy learning was used as the implicit motor learning walking intervention, whereas the explicit motor learning walking intervention consisted of detailed verbal instructions. Both groups received nine training sessions, 30 minutes each, for a period of three weeks.
Measurements: The primary outcome was walking speed measured by the 10-Meter Walk Test. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, immediate and 1-month post intervention. 
Results: No statistically or clinically relevant differences between groups were obtained post intervention (between-group difference estimated 0.02 m/s [95% CI -0.04 to 0.08] and at follow-up (between-group difference estimated -0.02 m/s [95% CI -0.09 to 0.05], p=0,563).
Limitations: The treatment effects may have been diluted by <U+2033>noise<U+2033> accompanied with research within real life settings, complex tasks and a representative sample.
Conclusions: Implicit motor learning was not superior to the explicit motor learning to improve walking speed in people after stroke in the chronic phase of recovery.","/content/10.1101/19008797v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008797v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Anti-Diabetic and Antiresorptive Pharmacotherapies for Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes-Induced Bone Disease: Protocol for a Two-Part Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis","Introduction
Glucocorticoid (GC) administration is an effective therapy commonly used in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, the use of GC can give rise to serious complications. The main detrimental side effect of GC therapy is significant bone loss, resulting in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP).

There are a variety of treatments available for preventing and managing GIOP; however, without clearly defined guidelines, it can be very difficult for physicians to choose the optimal therapy for their patients. Previous network meta-analyses (NMAs) and meta-analyses did not include all available RCT trials, or only performed pairwise comparisons. We present a protocol for a NMA that incorporates all available RCT patient data to provide the most comprehensive ranking of all available GIOP treatments in terms of their ability to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and decrease fracture incidences among adult patients undergoing GC treatments.

Methods and Analysis
We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Chinese literature sources (CNKI, CQVIP, Wanfang Data, Wanfang Med Online) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which fit our criteria. RCTs that evaluate different antiresorptive regimens taken by adult patients undergoing GC therapy during the study or had taken GC for at least 3 months in the year prior to study commencement with lumbar spine BMD, femoral neck BMD, total hip BMD, vertebral fracture incidences and/or non-vertebral fracture incidences as outcomes will be selected. 

We will perform title/abstract and full-text screening as well as data extraction in duplicate. Risk of bias (ROB) will be evaluated in duplicate for each study, and the quality of evidence will be examined using CINeMA in accordance to the GRADE framework. We will use R and gemtc to perform the NMA. We will report BMD results as weighted mean differences (WMDs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs), and we will report fracture incidences as odds ratios. We will use the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) scores to provide numerical estimations of the rankings of interventions.

Ethics and Dissemination
The study will not require ethical approval. The findings of the NMA will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences. We aim to produce the most comprehensive quantitative analysis regarding the management of GIOP. Our analysis should be able to provide physicians and patients with an up-to-date recommendation for pharmacotherapies in reducing incidences of bone loss and fractures associated with GIOP.

"Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder: symptomatic and syndromic thresholds and diagnostic operationalization","Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the most appropriate threshold for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) diagnosis and the impact of potential changes in diagnostic rules on prevalence levels in the community. 
Methods: Trained psychologists evaluated 3,562 pre-adolescents/early adolescents from the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort with the Development and Well-Being Behavior Assessment (DAWBA). The clinical threshold was assessed in three stages: symptomatic, syndromic and clinical operationalization. The symptomatic threshold identified the response category in each DAWBA item which separates normative misbehavior from a clinical indicator. The syndromic threshold identified the number of irritable mood and outbursts needed to capture pre-adolescents/early adolescents with high symptom levels. Clinical operationalization compared the impact of AND/OR rules for combining irritable mood and outbursts on impairment and levels of psychopathology. 
Results: At the symptomatic threshold, most irritable mood items were normative in their lowest response categories and clinically significant in their highest response categories. For outbursts some indicated a symptom even when present at only a mild level, while others did not indicate symptoms at any level. At the syndromic level, a combination of 2 out of 7 irritable mood and 3 out of 8 outburst indicators accurately captured a cluster of individuals with high level of symptoms. Analysis combining irritable mood and outbursts delineated non-overlapping aspects of DMDD, providing support for the OR rule in clinical operationalization. The best DMDD criteria resulted in a prevalence of 3%. 
Conclusions: Results provide information for initiatives aiming to provide data-driven and clinically-oriented operationalized criteria for DMDD.","/content/10.1101/19002436v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002436v3.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Family history and polygenic risk of cardiovascular disease: independent factors associated with secondary cardiovascular manifestations in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy","Background
Family history (FHx) of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a risk factor for CVD and a proxy for cardiovascular heritability. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) summarizing >1 million variants for coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with incident and recurrent CAD events. However, little is known about the influence of FHx or PRS on secondary cardiovascular events (sCVE) in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

Methods
We included 1,788 CEA patients from the Athero-Express Biobank. A weighted PRS for CAD including 1.7 million variants was calculated (MetaGRS). The composite endpoint of sCVE during three years follow-up included coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral events and cardiovascular death. We assessed the impact of FHx and MetaGRS on sCVE and carotid plaque composition. 

Results
Positive FHx was associated with a higher 3-year risk of sCVE independent of cardiovascular risk factors and MetaGRS (adjusted HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.07-1.82, p=0.013). Patients in the highest MetaGRS quintile had a higher 3-year risk of sCVE compared to the rest of the cohort independent of cardiovascular risk factors including FHx (adjusted HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.79, p=0.043), and their atherosclerotic plaques contained more fat (adjusted OR 1.59, 95%CI, 1.11-2.29, p=0.013) and more macrophages (OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.12-1.99, p=0.006).

Conclusion
In CEA patients, both positive FHx and higher MetaGRS were independently associated with increased risk of sCVE. Moreover, higher MetaGRS was associated with vulnerable plaque characteristics. Future studies should unravel underlying mechanisms and focus on the added value of PRS and FHx in individual risk prediction for sCVE.","/content/10.1101/19006718v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006718v2.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"A target product profile for electronic clinical decision support algorithms combined with point-of-care diagnostic test results to support evidence-based decisions during patient consultations by health workers","Health workers in low-resource settings often lack the support and tools to follow evidence-based clinical recommendations for diagnosing, treating and managing sick patients. Digital technologies, by combining patient health information and point of care diagnostics with evidence-based clinical protocols, can help improve the quality of care, the rational use of resources (humans, diagnostics and medicines) and save patient lives. The development of a target product profile for electronic clinical decision support algorithms (CDSAs) aimed at guiding preventive or curative consultations, and that integrate diagnostic test results will help align developer and implementer processes and specifications with the needs of end-users, in terms of quality, safety, performance and operational functionality. To identify characteristics for a CDSA, experts from academia, research institutions, and industry as well as policy makers with expertise in diagnostic and CDSA development, and implementation in LMICs were convened. Experts discussed the critical characteristics of a draft TPP which was revised and finalised through a Delphi process to facilitate consensus building. Experts were in overwhelming agreement that, given that CDSAs provide patients' management recommendations, the underlying clinical algorithms should be available in human readable format and evidence-based. Whenever possible, the algorithm output should take into account pre-test disease probabilities, diagnostic likelihood ratios of clinical or laboratory predictors and disease probability thresholds to test and to treat.  Validation processes should at a minimum ensure the CDSA are implementing faithfully the evidence-based algorithm they are based on (internal validation through clinical association and analytical validation). Additionally, clinical validation, bringing practice evidence about the impact of the CDSA use on health outcomes, was recognized as a good to have. The CDSAs should be designed to fit within clinic workflows, connectivity challenges and high volume settings. Data collected through the tool should conform to local patient privacy regulations and international data standards.","/content/10.1101/19008433v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008433v2.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Public and Global Health

"AN OPEN-SOURCE DATASET OF ANTI-VEGF THERAPY IN DIABETIC MACULAR OEDEMA PATIENTS OVER FOUR YEARS & THEIR VISUAL OUTCOMES","PURPOSE: To evaluate visual acuity (VA) outcomes of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in diabetic macular oedema (DMO).
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, electronic medical records for all patients undergoing intravitreal injections (IVI) in a tertiary referral centre between March 2013 and October 2018 were analysed. Treatment response in terms of visual acuity outcomes were reported for all eyes over a 4-year observation period.
RESULTS: Our cohort includes 2616 DMO eyes of 1965 patients over 48 months. Cox proportional hazards modelling identified injection number (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.18), male gender (HR = 1.13), and baseline VA (HR = 1.09) as independent predictors to reach a favorable visual outcome of more than 70 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. Half of our cohort reached 70 letters 1.9 months after starting anti-VEGF therapy. Of those that reached 70 letters, 50% fell below 70 by 14.7 months.
CONCLUSION: To date, this is the largest single center cohort study and over the longest observation period reporting on real-life outcomes of anti-VEGF in DMO. We have made an anonymised version of our dataset available on an open-source data repository as a resource for all clinical researchers globally.","/content/10.1101/19009332v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009332v2.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Ophthalmology

"Prediction of Suicidal Ideation in the Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health Component Using Deep Learning","Introduction: Suicidal ideation (SI) is prevalent in the general population, and is a prominent risk factor for suicide. However, predicting which patients are likely to have SI remains a challenge. Deep Learning (DL) may be a useful tool in this context, as it can be used to find patterns in complex, heterogeneous, and incomplete psychiatric datasets. An automated screening system for SI could help prompt clinicians to be more attentive to patients at risk for suicide.
Methods: Using the Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health Component, we trained a DL model based on 23,859 survey responses to predict lifetime SI on an individual patient basis. Models were created to predict both lifetime and last 12 month SI. We reduced 582 possible model parameters captured by the survey to 96 and 21 feature versions of the models. Models were trained using an undersampling procedure that balanced the training set between SI and non-SI respondents; validation was done on held-out data.  
Results: AUC was used as the main model metric. For lifetime SI, the 96 feature model had an AUC of 0.79 and the 21 feature model had an AUC of 0.75. For SI in the last 12 months the 96 feature model had an AUC of 0.76 and the 21 feature model had an AUC of 0.69. DL outperformed random forest classifiers.
Discussion: Although requiring further study to ensure clinical relevance and sample generalizability, this study is a proof-of-concept for the use of DL to improve prediction of SI. This kind of model would help start conversations with patients which could lead to improved care and, it is hoped, a reduction in suicidal behavior.","/content/10.1101/19010413v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010413v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Lower limb muscle activity underlying temporal gait asymmetry post-stroke","Objective: Asymmetric walking after stroke is common, detrimental, and difficult to treat, but current knowledge of underlying physiological mechanisms is limited. This study investigated electromyographic (EMG) features of temporal gait asymmetry (TGA).
Methods: Participants post-stroke with or without TGA and control adults (n=27, 8, and 9, respectively) performed self-paced overground gait trials. EMG, force plate, and motion capture data were collected. Lower limb muscle activity was compared across groups and sides (more/less affected). Correlation between burst timing variables and asymmetry ratios was examined.
Results: Significant group by side interaction effects were found: fewer TGA group dorsiflexor bursts during swing (p=.0009), more affected plantarflexor stance activity ended early (p=.0006) and less affected dorsiflexor on/off time was delayed (p<.01) in persons with asymmetry compared to symmetric and normative controls. Less affected side EMG timing correlated most with swing time ratio (r=0.68-0.90, p<.001).
Conclusions: Temporal patterns of muscular activation, particularly about the ankle around the stance-to-swing transition period, are associated with TGA. The results may reflect specific impairments or compensations that affect locomotor coordination.
Significance: Neuromuscular underpinnings of spatiotemporal asymmetry have not been previously characterized. These novel findings may inform targeted therapeutic strategies to improve gait quality after stroke.","/content/10.1101/19010421v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010421v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Establishing Cutoffs for Streptococcal Antibody Titers in Uganda: Implications for Rheumatic Fever Diagnosis","Background
Central to rheumatic fever (RF) diagnosis is evidence of streptococcal exposure, specifically antistreptolysin O (ASO) and antideoxyribonuclease B (ADB) antibodies. It is unknown if these antibody titers should be adjusted to the background exposure rates of GAS or if published standards should be used. Here, we establish the normal values of ASO and ADB in Uganda and examine RF case detection using published vs. population-specific thresholds.

Methods
Participants (age 0-50 years) were recruited. ASO was measured in-country by nephelometric technique. ADB samples were sent to Australia (PathWest) for ADB determination by enzyme inhibition assay, andthe 80% upper limit values by age were established. The published standard values for ASO (200IU/ml) and ADB (375IU/ml) were compared to the Ugandan 80% upper limit of normal values (ULN) for RF case detection in children 5-15 years.

Findings
Of the 428 participants, 16 were excluded from analysis (9 sore throat, 1 skin sores, 5 fever, 4 echocardiograms showing occult RHD), and 183 of the remaining were children 5-15 years. The median ASO titer in this age group was 220 IU/ml, with the 80th percentile value of 389 IU/ml. The median ADB titer in this age group was 375 IU/ml, with the 80th percentile value of 568 IU/ml. Application of new Ugandan cutoffs to 528 children enrolled in our prospective RF study, reduced the number of definite RF cases to 120/528 (22-7%), as compared to 173/528 (32-8%) using published normal values. 

Interpretation
The 80th percentile ULN for ASO and ADB are higher in Uganda than in other countries. Applying these higher values to RF diagnosis in Uganda results in higher diagnostic specificity, but some unknown loss in sensitivity. Implications of over-diagnosis and missed cases will be explored through a longitudinal follow-up study of children in the RF research program.

"From frail to fit after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation: Scope of the problem and a strength-based solution","Background:  Frailty is a common but underdiagnosed syndrome among long-term survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).  Conditions such as malnutrition, fatigue, and weakness may suggest frailty despite patients not receiving a formal diagnosis. Furthermore, the optimal interventions to overcome frailty in long-term survivors of allogeneic HCT is not yet established.

Patients and Methods: This study consists of a retrospective and prospective component.  First, we completed a retrospective review using diagnosis data from the electronic medical record to estimate the prevalence of components of frailty in 1077 recipients of allogeneic HCT through 5 years post-transplant.  Second, we developed a community-based pilot study of strength training for long-term survivors of allogeneic HCT that addressed several common barriers exercise engagement and adherence. Four allogeneic HCT recipients (2 males, 2 females) and 4 controls (2 males, 2 females) completed the strength training pilot study, consisting of a baseline assessment, 10 weeks of personalized and supervised strength programming at least once weekly as a group, and an end-of-study assessment to measure progress in strength, body composition, and a standardized measure of self-efficacy.

Results:  Despite a lack of a formal diagnosis, approximately 80% of HCT recipients in this series received a diagnosis of a component of frailty (weakness, fatigue, or malnutrition), and over 1/3 of HCT recipients had symptoms extending beyond 1 year.  Over the course of the strength training pilot study, both pre-frail/frail allogeneic HCT recipients and healthy controls doubled their total strength, lost body fat, and gained muscle mass. Self-efficacy improved from baseline in allogeneic HCT recipients after the strength training pilot program.

Discussion: Based upon the prevalence of frailty-related diagnoses among long-term survivors of HCT, a comprehensive mitigation strategy needs to be developed for this population. A community-based strength training program that includes a personalized component, a group setting, and caregiver/partner involvement appears feasible and overcomes several established barriers to exercise engagement and adherence.","/content/10.1101/19010397v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010397v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Transplantation

"DNA methylation biomarker in blood predicts frailty in an HIV-positive veteran population","Background: With the improved life expectancy in people living with HIV, predicting individual frailty is important for clinical care. DNA methylation (DNAm) has emerged as a robust biomarker in precision medicine and has been previously linked to aging and mortality in non-HIV populations. Here, we aim to establish a panel of DNAm features selected from blood methylome to predict frailty in HIV-positive men from a veteran population, Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS). 
Methods: We used a well-established score, VACS Index, as a measure of frailty. Samples (ntotal=1,150) were divided into a training set (n=612) and a validation set (n=538). We first selected a panel of frailty-associated CpGs by conducting an epigenome-wide association analysis on the VACS index in the training set. We then applied four machine learning methods to build models to predict high and low frailty individuals in the training set. The prediction models were tested in the validation set. A methylation score constructed from the selected CpGs was tested an associated with mortality by performing survival analysis. To assess the biological relevance of the selected CpG sites, we performed a gene ontology enrichment analysis. 
Results: A panel of 119 CpGs were identified from the training set (False Discovery Rate <0.2) that showed excellent performance on predicting high frailty individuals with Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.835 (95%CI: 0.792, 0.879) and balanced accuracy of 0.693. The same panel showed good performance on predicting low frailty individuals with AUC of 0.735 (95%CI: 0.688-0.782) and a balanced accuracy of 0.528. The methylation score from the 119 CpGs was significantly associated with 5-year and 10-year mortality with hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI:1.033, 1.897 p=0.03) and 1.48 (95%CI: 1.10, 2.02; p=0.01) respectively. These 119 CpGs were located within or near 73 genes that were significantly enriched in 9 biological pathways relevant to immune and inflammation response.
Conclusions: We identified a panel of predictive DNAm features associated with frailty and mortality among HIV-positive population. These DNAm features may serve as biomarkers to discriminate high and low frailty people who live with HIV.","/content/10.1101/19010272v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010272v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","HIV/AIDS

"Cohort profile: The International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) in sub-Saharan Africa, 2012-2019","Purpose: The objectives of the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) are to (i) evaluate the delivery of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in children, adolescents and adults in sub-Saharan Africa, (ii) to describe ART regimen effectiveness, durability and tolerability, (iii) to examine HIV-related comorbidities and co-infections, and (iv) to examine the pregnancy- and HIV-related outcomes of women on ART and their infants exposed to HIV or antiretroviral therapy in utero or via breastmilk.
Participants: IeDEA is organized in four regions (Central, East, Southern and West Africa), with 240 treatment and care sites, six data centres at African, European and US universities, and almost 1.4 million children, adolescents and adult people living with HIV (PLWHIV) enrolled.  
Findings to date: The data include socio-demographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, opportunistic events, treatment regimens, clinic visits and laboratory measurements. They have been used to analyse outcomes in people living with HIV-1 or HIV-2 who initiate ART, including determinants of mortality, of switching to second-line and third-line ART, drug resistance, loss to follow-up and the immunological and virological response to different ART regimens. Programme-level estimates of mortality have been corrected for loss to follow-up. We examined the impact of co-infection with hepatitis B and C, and the epidemiology of different cancers and of (multi-drug resistant) tuberculosis, renal disease and of mental illness. The adoption of 'Treat All', making ART available to all PLWHIV regardless of CD4+ cell count or clinical stage was another important research topic. 
Future plans: IeDEA has formulated several research priorities for the 'Treat All' era in sub-Saharan Africa. It recently obtained funding to set up sentinel sites where additional data are prospectively collected on cardiometabolic risks factors as well as mental health and liver diseases, and is planning to create a drug resistance database.","/content/10.1101/19010231v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010231v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","HIV/AIDS

"The Pan-Cancer Landscape of Prognostic Germline Variants in 10,582 Patients","While clinical data provides physicians with information about patient prognosis, genomic data can further improve these predictions. We analyzed sequencing data from over 10,000 cancer patients and identified hundreds of prognostic germline variants using multivariate Cox regression models. These variants provide information about patient outcomes beyond clinical information currently in use and may augment clinical decisions based on expected tumor aggressiveness. Molecularly, at least twelve of the germline variants are likely associated with patient outcome through perturbation of protein structure and at least five through association with gene expression differences. About half of these germline variants are in previously reported tumor suppressors or oncogenes, with the other half pointing to loci of previously unstudied genes in the literature that should be further investigated for roles in cancers. Our results suggest that germline variation contributes to tumor progression across most cancers and contains patient outcome information not captured by clinical factors.","/content/10.1101/19010264v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010264v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Isolating Effects of Medicare Code Slot Expansion on Longitudinal Risk Assessment","Background: The evaluation of trends in patient outcomes requires adjustment for the changes in case-mix over time and, thus, could be influenced by the expansion of code slots on inpatient claims that occurred in January 2011. We tested the hypothesis that the changes in code slots caused an artifactual increase in the case mix over time compared with a strategy that restricted inpatient codes to the same number of slots over time, excluding consideration of codes beyond the first 9 after the expansion.

Methods: In Medicare claims over a 5-year period spanning the inpatient code slot expansion (2008-2012), we created cohorts of hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and pneumonia, common hospitalization conditions included in federal policies. We obtained information on risk factors for 30-day post-discharge mortality or readmission for each condition from inpatient facility Medicare claims, outpatient facility claims and professional (or carrier) claims. We evaluated the effects of additional codes captured from the expanded slots in inpatient claims on the number of risk factors or model covariates, overall and based on their contribution to the risk of mortality or readmission. We modelled the effects of code expansion on risk-assessment using an interrupted time series framework.
Results: There were 2,102,509 eligible hospitalizations for HF, 872,734 for AMI and 1,824,079 for pneumonia. The average number of risk factors increased across all covariate selection strategies. There was a larger increase in monthly average covariate count that included all codes at the time of the code slot increase relative to a strategy that consistently used only 9 inpatient codes (level change in interrupted time series model, 0.9% [95% CI 0.7% to 1.1%] in HF, 0.6% [0.5% to 0.7%] for AMI and 0.6% [0.4% to 0.8%] for pneumonia). Using both inpatient and outpatient/carrier codes for assessing risk factors, there was a smaller difference between strategies using 9 inpatient codes, compared with all inpatient claims (relative excess increase in covariates by 0.6% [0.4% to 0.8%] in HF, 0.4% [0.3% to 0.5%] for AMI, and 0.3% [0.1% to 0.6%] in pneumonia). However, the additional codes were limited to covariates with small contributions to the risk-adjustment models for mortality, without a significant inflection in measured risk of mortality across code expansion (P>0.05 in interrupted time-series models). Measured readmission risk increased with using only inpatient claims for risk assessment, but not if all outpatient and carrier claims were also used (P>0.05 in interrupted time-series models).
Conclusions: The expansion of inpatient code slots did not meaningfully affect the measurement of the risk of mortality or readmission, especially if comprehensive inpatient and outpatient claims are used, because the additional covariates only included conditions with a modest influence on risk adjusted models. The use of all versus limited codes after the code slot expansion has a minimal effect on evaluating trends in these conditions.","/content/10.1101/19010074v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010074v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Health Policy

"Potential Predictive Factors for Breast Cancer Subtypes from a North Cyprus Cohort Analysis","More than three hundreds North Cyprus breast cancer patients with subtype information are surveyed for their demographic, reproductive, genetic, epidemiological factors. Despite the fact that our cohort differs significantly from some larger cohorts (e.g., the Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR) with samples from USA/Canada/Australia) in age, menopause status, age of menarche, parity, education level, oral contraceptive use, breast feeding, the distribution of breast subtypes is not significantly different. Using regularized regressions, we show that the estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) subtype is positively related to post-menopause and negatively associated with hormone therapy; the estrogen-receptor-positive and progesterone-receptor-positive (ER+/PR+) subtype is positively associated with breast feeding, and negatively associated with hormone therapy status. On the other hand, the human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) subtype, which itself is negatively correlated with ER+ and ER+/PR+, is positively related to having first-degree-relative with cancer, and negatively associated with post-menopause. Single and multiple regression also identify older age to be positively correlated to ER+ and ER+/PR+ subtypes, and negatively correlated to HER2+ subtype. Assuming ER+ and ER+/PR+ subtypes to have better prognostic, then post-menopause and breast-feeding are beneficial, and hormone therapy treatment is detrimental.","/content/10.1101/19010181v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010181v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Epidemiology

"Gaze, Visual, Myoelectric, and Inertial Data of Grasps for Intelligent Prosthetics","Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, having severe physical and psychological repercussions on a person's life. Despite extensive efforts devoted to restoring the missing functionality via dexterous myoelectric hand prostheses, natural and robust control usable in everyday life is still challenging.

We present a dataset to investigate the inclusion of eye tracking and first person video to provide more stable intent recognition for prosthetic control. This multimodal dataset contains surface electromyography and accelerometry of the forearm, and gaze, first person video, and inertial measurements of the head recorded from 15 transradial amputees and 30 able-bodied subjects performing grasping tasks.

"Whole genome sequencing detects minimal clustering among Escherichia coli Sequence Type 131 H30 isolates collected from U.S. children's hospitals","Escherichia coli sequence type 131 H30 has garnered global attention as a dominant antimicrobial-resistant lineage of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, but its transmission dynamics remain undefined. We applied whole genome sequencing to identify putative transmission clusters among clinical isolates of H30 from children across the U.S. Of 126 isolates, 17 were involved in 8 putative transmission clusters; 4 clusters involved isolates with some evidence of healthcare-associated epidemiologic linkages. Geographic clustering analyses showed weak geographic clustering. These findings are consistent with a framework where within-hospital transmission is not a main contributor to the propagation of H30 in a pediatric setting.","/content/10.1101/19010140v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010140v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Epidemiology

"Clinical Laboratory Validation and Implementation of Quantitative, Real-Time PCR-based Monitoring of NPM1 Type A Mutation","NPM1 is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the mutations consist of a variety of small insertions; the most common NPM1 mutation (ie, Type A) accounts for approximately 80% of all NPM1 mutations. NPM1 mutations have been reported to have prognostic significance in AML and, more recently, monitoring mutant NPM1 levels during and after therapy has been described to predict relapse and survival. Despite the published relevance of this molecular biomarker, routine residual disease monitoring for mutant NPM1 levels has not been widely adopted in many academic clinical laboratories. In this manuscript, we present the validation and implementation of a quantitative, real-time PCR-based method for the monitoring of NPM1 Type A mutant transcripts, for use in routine practice in a clinical laboratory. We have found that this assay format is sensitive and reproducible. We describe the rigorous validation procedure and share observations that will help other clinical laboratories that may wish to implement this type of testing. We show comparison of the results from this assay to other assays and a representative case is provided which highlights the utility of the findings from this assay. Taken together, in the context of molecular testing for residual disease in AML, which is an area of practice that continues to expand, we have found that this method and protocol will serve as an appropriate option for monitoring NPM1 Type A mutation levels in clinical practice.","/content/10.1101/19010124v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010124v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Awareness and knowledge of interventional radiology among medical students at an Indian institution","Purpose:
Interventional radiology (IR) is a novel and evolving sub-specialty that encompasses image guided diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. With the advent of new imaging techniques and an increasing demand of minimally invasive procedures, IR continues to grow as a core component in medical and surgical therapeutics. Radiology teaching is a part of medical undergraduate curriculum; however, the medical undergraduate cohort lacks exposure to IR principles, methods and techniques.
The purpose of this study is to determine the knowledge and awareness of IR among medical students in a single university in India. 
 
Materials and Methods:
Electronic anonymous surveys were sent to 350 medical students of Pt. JNM Medical College, Raipur, India. Each survey comprised of questions assessing knowledge and exposure to IR. A total of 70 students (20%) responded. 
 
Results:
85.7% of respondents positively reported that radiologists have a role in diagnostic as well as therapeutic interventions, however, 60%  students cited a very poor/poor knowledge of IR. A larger part, 91.5%, stated that they would be interested in IR based teaching delivered as a part of their undergraduate teaching program.  Those who knew at least one interventional radiology technique were 1.51 (95% CI: 1.02 - 2.22; p < 0.05) times more likely to be considering it as a career. 
 
Conclusion:
Medical Students demonstrate a poor knowledge of IR. This corresponds to a limited and inconsistent exposure to IR in medical schools. The study suggests that there is a need to deliver an  IR based curriculum in medical undergraduate teaching in India.","/content/10.1101/19010066v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010066v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Medical Education

"Prediction of Colorectal Cancer Risk Based on Profiling with Common Genetic Variants","Background: Stratifying the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) based on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) within populations has the potential to optimize screening and develop targeted prevention strategies. 
Methods: A metaanalysis of eleven genome wide association studies (GWAS), comprising 16 871 cases and 26 328 controls, was performed to capture CRC susceptibility variants. Genetic models with several candidate PRSs were generated from Scottish CRC case control studies (6478 cases and 11 043 controls) for prediction of overall and site specific CRC. Model performance was validated in UK Biobank (4800 cases and 20 287 controls). The 10-year absolute risk of CRC was estimated by modelling PRS with age and sex using the CRC incidence and mortality rates in the UK population.  
Findings: A weighted PRS including 116 CRC SNPs (wPRS116) showed the strongest performance. Deconstructing the PRS into multiple genetic risk regional scores or inclusion of additional SNPs that did not reach genome wide significance did not provide any further improvement on predictive performance. The odds ratio (OR) for CRC risk per SD of wPRS116 in Scottish dataset was 1.46 (95%CI: 1.41 to 1.50, c statistics: 0.603). Consistent estimates were observed in UK Biobank (OR=1.49, 95%CI: 1.44 to 
1.54, c statistics: 0.610) and showed no substantial heterogeneity among tumor sites. Compared to the middle quintile, those in the highest 1% of PRSs had 3.25 fold higher risk and those in the lowest 1% had 0.32 fold lower risk of developing CRC. Modelling PRS with age and sex in the general UK population allows the identification of a high risk group with 10 year absolute risk >5%. 
Interpretation: By optimizing wPRS116, we show that genetic factors increase predictive performance but this increment is equivalent to the extraction of only one tenth of the genetic susceptibility. When employing genetic risk profiling in population settings it provides a degree of risk discrimination that could, in principle, be integrated into population based screening programs.","/content/10.1101/19010116v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010116v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Epidemiology

"The Impact of Scaling up Dolutegravir on Antiretroviral Resistance in South Africa","Background:
Rising resistance of HIV-1 to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) threatens the success of the global scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to WHO-recommended dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimens could reduce this threat due to DTG's high genetic barrier to resistance. We used mathematical modelling to examine the impact of the scale-up of DTG-based ART on NNRTI pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) in South Africa, 2019-2040.

Methods and results:
We adapted the MARISA (Modelling Antiretroviral drug Resistance In South Africa) model, an epidemiological model of the transmission of NNRTI resistance in South Africa. We modelled the introduction of DTG in 2019 under two scenarios: DTG as first-line regimen for ART-initiators, or DTG for all patients, including patients on suppressive NNRTI-based ART. Due to safety concerns related to DTG during pregnancy, we assessed the impact of prescribing DTG to all men and in addition to i) women beyond reproductive age, ii) women beyond reproductive age or using contraception, and iii) all women. The model projections show that, compared to the continuation of NNRTI-based ART, introducing DTG would lead to a reduction in NNRTI resistance in all scenarios if both ART initiators are started on a DTG-based regimens and those on NNRTI-based regimens are rapidly switched to DTG. NNRTI resistance would continue to increase if DTG-based ART was restricted to men. When given to all men and women, DTG-based ART could reduce the level of NNRTI resistance from 58.5% (without DTG) to 14.8% (with universal DTG) in 2040. If all men and women beyond reproductive age or on contraception are started on or switched to DTG-based ART, NNRTI resistance would reach 35.1% in 2040.

Conclusions:
Our model shows the potential benefit of scaling up DTG-based regimens for halting the rise of NNRTI resistance. Starting or switching all men and women to DTG would lead to a sustained decline in resistance levels whereas using DTG-based ART in all men, or in men and women beyond childbearing age, would slow down the increase in levels of NNRTI resistance.","/content/10.1101/19010132v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010132v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Epidemiology

"VALIDATION OF PHLEBOTOMY PERFORMANCE METRICS DEVELOPED AS PART OF A PROFICIENCY BASED PROGRESSION INITIATIVE TO MITIGATE WRONG BLOOD IN TUBE","Aims: 
The purpose of this study was to 1) characterise the procedure of phlebotomy, deconstruct it into its constituent parts and develop a performance metric for the purpose of training healthcare professionals in a large teaching hospital, 2) evaluate the construct validity of the phlebotomy metric and establish a proficiency benchmark.

Method: Using video recordings of the procedure, we defined a performance metric. This was brought to a modified Delphi meeting, where consensus was reached by an expert panel. To demonstrate construct validity, we used the metric to objectively assess the performance of novices and expert practitioners.

Results: A phlebotomy metric consisting of 11 phases and 77 steps was developed. The mean inter-rater reliability was 0.91 (min 0.83, max 0.95). The Expert group completed more steps of the procedure (72 Vs 69), made 69% fewer errors (19 vs 13, p = 0.014) and 300% fewer critical errors (1 Vs 4, p = 0.002) than the Novice Group.

Conclusions: The metrics demonstrated construct validity and the proficiency benchmark was established with a minimum observation of 69 steps, with no critical errors and no more than 13 errors in total.","/content/10.1101/19010033v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010033v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Medical Education

"Short-term mental health sequelae of bereavement predict long-term physical health decline in older adults: US Health and Retirement Study Analysis","Objective. Death of a spouse is a common late-life event with mental- and physical-health sequelae. Whereas mental-health sequelae of spousal death tend to be transient, physical-health sequelae may persist, leading to disability and mortality. Growing evidence linking poor mental health to aging-related disease suggests the hypothesis that transient poor mental health following death of a spouse could be a harbinger of physical health decline. If so, identification of bereavement-related mental health symptoms could provide an opportunity for prevention. 

Methods. We analyzed data from N=35,103 individuals followed from 1994-2014 in the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and identified N=4,629 who were widowed during follow-up. We tested change in mental and physical health from pre-bereavement through the 5-year period following spousal death. 

Results. Bereaved spouses experienced an immediate increase in depressive symptoms following their spouses' deaths but the depressive shock attenuated within one year. Bereaved spouses also experienced increases in disability, chronic-disease morbidity, and hospitalization, which grew in magnitude with time since spousal death, especially among older HRS participants. Bereaved spouses were at increased risk of death compared to HRS participants who were not bereaved. The magnitude of depressive symptoms in the immediate aftermath of spousal death predicted physical-health decline and mortality risk over 5 years of follow-up. 

Conclusions. Bereavement-related depressive symptoms provide an indicator of risk for physical health decline and death in older adults. Screening for depressive symptoms in bereaved older adults may represent an opportunity for intervention to preserve healthy lifespan.","/content/10.1101/19009878v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009878v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Geriatric Medicine

"The Integrated Voxel Analysis Method (IVAM) to Diagnose Onset of Alzheimer's Disease and Identify Brain Regions through Structural MRI Images.","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides three-dimensional anatomical and physiological details of the human brain. We describe the Integrated Voxel Analysis Method (IVAM) which, through machine learning, classifies MRI images of brains afflicted with early Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This fully automatic method uses an extra trees regressor model in which the feature vector input contains the intensities of voxels, whereby the effect of AD on a single voxel can be predicted. The resulting tree predicts based on the following two steps: a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm based on Euclidean distance with the feature vector to classify whole images based on their distribution of affected voxels and a voxel-by-voxel classification by the tree of every voxel in the image. An Ising model filter follows voxel-by-voxel tree-classification to remove artifacts and to facilitate clustering of classification results which identify significant voxel clusters affected by AD. We apply this method to T1-weighted MRI images obtained from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) using images belonging to normal and early AD-afflicted individuals associated with a Client Dementia Rating (CDR) which we use as the target in the supervised learning. Furthermore, statistical analysis using a pre-labeled brain atlas automatically identifies significantly affected brain regions. While achieving 90% AD classification accuracy on 198 images in the OASIS dataset, the method reveals morphological differences caused by the onset of AD.","/content/10.1101/19009597v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009597v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Neurology

"Operationalizing Occupational Fatigue in Pharmacists: An Exploratory Factor Analysis","Introduction: The Quadruple Aim recognizes that caring for the healthcare employee is necessary to optimize patient outcomes and health system performance. Although previous research has assessed pharmacists' workload, this study is the first to describe pharmacist occupational fatigue - a characteristic of excessive workload that inhibits workers' abilities to function at normal capacity. The purpose of this study was to describe occupational fatigue in pharmacists using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) - assessing whether dimensional structures used to describe occupational fatigue in other health professions fit pharmacist perceptions. 
Methods: A model was created to conceptualize ""fatigue"" domains found in the literature. A priori, the two domains identified were physical fatigue (ex. physical discomfort), and mental fatigue (ex. trouble thinking clearly). These domains were operationalized and used to create a paper survey that was distributed to licensed pharmacists at a pharmacy conference. An EFA was conducted to identify the key domains underlying pharmacist perceptions of fatigue.
Results: A total of 283 surveys were distributed and 115 were returned and usable. Respondents were primarily white, female, worked 9.52 hours-per-day on average, and mean age of 39-years-old. The EFA suggested a statistically significant two-factor model (<U+03C7>^2 9.73, p=0.28; TLI 0.998, RMSEA 0.048), which included physical fatigue (a = 0.87) and mental fatigue (a = 0.82). 
Discussion: The EFA yielded a structure similar to what was anticipated from the literature with physical and mental fatigue dimensions. This is just the first step in promoting systematic interventions to prevent or cope with fatigue and prevent the downstream patient, pharmacist, and institutional outcomes. By addressing fatigue and caring for employees, health care systems can take steps to work toward the Quadruple Aim.","/content/10.1101/19008169v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008169v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Disrupts Functional Dynamic Attractors of Healthy Mental States","The human brain has the ability of changing its wiring configuration by increasing or decreasing functional connectivity strength between specific areas. Variable but recurring configuration patterns in dynamic functional connectivity have been observed during resting fMRI experiments, patterns which are defined as dynamic brain states. The question arises whether in a regular healthy brain these states evolve in a random fashion or in a specific sequential order. The current work reveals both the specific state sequence in healthy brains, as well as the set of disruptions in this sequence produced by traumatic brain injury. The healthy sequence consists of oscillatory dynamic connectivity patterns that orbit an attractor state in a high dimensional space. Using discovery (96 subjects) and replication (74 subjects) cohorts, this study demonstrated that mild traumatic brain injury results in immediate orbital disruptions that recover over time. Brain dynamics enter a status of disrupted orbits right after injury, with partial recovery at 4 weeks, and full recovery at 3 months post-injury. In summary, our results describe an aspect of neuronal dysfunction in mild traumatic brain injury that is fully based on brain state dynamics, and different from traditional brain connectivity strength measures.","/content/10.1101/19007906v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007906v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Neurology

"Immune response and endocytosis pathways are associated with the escape of Alzheimer's Disease","The risk to develop and escape Alzheimer's disease (AD) is influenced by a constellation of genetic variants, each associated with specific molecular pathways. Different pathways may differentially contribute to the modification of the AD-risk. We studied the molecular mechanisms that explain the extreme ends of the cognitive spectrum by comparing pathway-specific polygenic risk scores (pathway-PRS) in individuals with AD and those who escaped AD until old age. We used 29 genetic variants associated with AD to calculate pathway-PRS for five major pathways involved in AD. We developed an integrative framework that allows multiple genes to associate with a variant, and multiple pathways to associate with a gene. We studied pathway-PRS in patients with AD (N=1,909), population controls (N=1,654), and cognitively healthy centenarians who escaped AD (N=293). Last, we estimated the contribution of each pathway to the genetic risk of AD in the general population. All pathway-PRS significantly associated with increased AD-risk and escaping AD (p<0.05). The pathway that contributed the most to the overall modulation of AD-risk was ÃŸ-amyloid metabolism (32%), driven mainly by APOE variants. After excluding APOE variants, all pathway-PRS associated with increased AD-risk (p<0.05), while specifically immune response (p=3.1x10-3) and endocytosis (p=3.8x10-4) associated with escaping AD. These pathways were the main contributors to the overall modulation of genetic risk of AD (41.3% and 21.4%, respectively). Our work suggests that immune response and endocytosis might be involved in general neuro-protective functions, and highlights the need to study these pathways, next to ÃŸ-amyloid metabolism.","/content/10.1101/19009464v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009464v2.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Increasing Firearm Deaths in The Youngest Americans: Ecologic Correlation with Firearm Prevalence","Background:   In the United States (U.S.), the overall death rate in 1-4 year-olds had been steadily declining until 2011, after which it ceased to improve. To understand this trend reversal, we investigated trends in the causes of their deaths.
Methods:  Mortality data were obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, firearm background check data from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and civilian firearm prevalence from the Small Arms Survey. 
Findings:  In 1-4 year-olds, the rate of fatal firearm accidents during 2002-2017 increased exponentially at an average rate of 6.0%/year (p=0.0003). The rate of increase was the greatest of all evaluable causes of death in the age group. Both the rate increase and most recent absolute rate in firearm accidental deaths in young children were correlated with the concurrent corresponding rate of firearm background checks (p = 0.0002 and 0.003, respectively). Also, the firearm accidental death rate in countries with high civilian firearm prevalence was correlated with the number of guns per civilian population (p=0.002).
Interpretation:   Prior to 2004, the childhood firearm death rate did not increase during the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.  Since 2004 when the Ban ended, the steadily increasing rate of sales and concomitant availability of, and access to, firearms in the U.S. has been associated with an increase in fatal firearm accidents in its youngest children.  The acceleration of firearm deaths and injuries among young Americans requires urgent, definitive solutions that address firearm prevalence.
Funding:  No external funding.","/content/10.1101/19009191v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009191v2.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Public and Global Health

"Spatial epidemiology of Japanese encephalitis virus and other infections of the central nervous system in Lao PDR (2003 - 2011): a retrospective analysis","Central nervous system (CNS) infections are important contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide, but the causative agents for ~50% patients are never identified. Here we present the results of a spatial analysis of CNS infections in Lao PDR (2003 - 2011). Hospitalizations for suspected CNS infection were recorded at Mahosot Hospital in Vientiane and tests for a large panel of pathogens were performed. All home villages were geocoded using patient records and official Lao PDR census data. The spatial distributions of CNS infections were analyzed by major diagnoses. Summary statistics and logistic regressions were used to test for associations between geographic, environmental, and demographic variables and diagnoses. Out of 1,065 patients, 450 (42%) were assigned a confirmed diagnosis. Japanese encephalitis virus ((JEV); n=94) and Cryptococcus spp. (n=70) were the most common infections. Patients undergoing diagnostic LP for suspected CNS infections lived closer to major roads than would be expected by chance alone. JEV was the most spatially dispersed, peaked in the rainy season and was most common among children. JEV patients came from villages that had higher surface flooding during the same month as admission and, in comparison to the home villages of other patients, came from villages at higher elevation. Cryptococcus spp. infections clustered near Vientiane and among adults.  Geographic and financial access to healthcare may explain the close proximity of these patients to major roads and also suggest that these hospital data vastly underestimate the true community burden of CNS infections. As Lao PDR is undergoing major developmental and environmental changes, the space-time distributions of the causative agents of CNS infection will also likely change. There is a major need for increased diagnostic abilities; increased access to healthcare, especially for rural populations; and for increased surveillance throughout the nation.","/content/10.1101/19005884v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005884v3.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Public and Global Health

"PathFlowAI: A High-Throughput Workflow for Preprocessing, Deep Learning and Interpretation in Digital Pathology","The diagnosis of disease often requires analysis of a biopsy. Many diagnoses depend not only on the presence of certain features but on their location within the tissue. Recently, a number of deep learning diagnostic aids have been developed to classify digitized biopsy slides. Clinical workflows often involve processing of more than 500 slides per day.  But, clinical use of deep learning diagnostic aids would require a preprocessing workflow that is cost-effective, flexible, scalable, rapid, interpretable, and transparent. Here, we present such a workflow, optimized using Dask and mixed precision training via APEX, capable of handling any patch-level or slide level classification and prediction problem.  The workflow uses a flexible and fast preprocessing and deep learning analytics pipeline, incorporates model interpretation and has a highly storage-efficient audit trail.  We demonstrate the utility of this package on the analysis of a prototypical anatomic pathology specimen, liver biopsies for evaluation of hepatitis from a prospective cohort.  The preliminary data indicate that PathFlowAI may become a cost-effective and time-efficient tool for clinical use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms.","/content/10.1101/19003897v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003897v2.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Pathology

"Examining the effect of smoking on suicidal ideation and attempts: A triangulation of epidemiological approaches","Background: Previous literature has demonstrated a strong association between cigarette smoking and suicide-related behaviours, characterised as ideation, plans, attempts and suicide related death. This association has not previously been examined in a causal inference framework and has important implications for suicide prevention strategies. 
Aims: We aimed to examine the evidence for an association between smoking behaviours (initiation, smoking status, heaviness, lifetime smoking) and suicidal thoughts or attempts by triangulating across observational and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses.
Methods: First, in the UK Biobank, we calculate observed associations between smoking behaviours and suicidal thoughts or attempts. Second, we used Mendelian randomisation (MR) to explore the relationship between smoking and suicide using genetic variants as instruments to reduce bias from residual confounding and reverse causation. 
Results: Our observational analysis showed a relationship between smoking behaviour and suicidal behaviour, particularly between smoking initiation and suicidal attempts (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.91 to 2.26, p<0.001). The MR analysis and single SNP analysis, however, did not support this. Despite past literature showing a positive dose-response relationship our results showed no clear evidence for a causal effect of smoking on suicidal behaviours.
Conclusion: This was the first MR study to explore the effect of smoking on suicidal behaviours. Our results suggest that, despite observed associations, there is no strong evidence for a causal effect of smoking behaviour on suicidal behaviour. Our evidence suggests that further research is needed into alternative risk factors for suicide which might make better intervention targets.","/content/10.1101/19007013v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007013v2.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Epidemiology

"Functional MRI connectivity accurately distinguishes cases with psychotic disorders from healthy controls, based on cortical features associated with neurodevelopment","Background: Machine learning (ML) can distinguish cases with psychotic disorder from healthy controls based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, with reported accuracy in the range 60-100%. It is not yet clear which MRI metrics are the most informative for case-control ML.
Methods: We analysed multi-modal MRI data from two independent case-control studies of patients with psychotic disorders (cases, N = 65, 28; controls, N = 59, 80) and compared ML accuracy across 5 MRI metrics. Cortical thickness, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were estimated at each of 308 cortical regions, as well as functional and structural connectivity between each pair of regions. Functional connectivity data were also used to classify non-psychotic siblings of cases (N=64) and to distinguish cases from controls in a third independent study (cases, N=67; controls, N=81).
Results: In both principal studies, the most diagnostic metric was fMRI connectivity: the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 92% and 77%, respectively. The cortical map of diagnostic connectivity features was replicable between studies (r = 0.31, P < 0.001); correlated with replicable case-control differences in fMRI degree centrality, and with prior cortical maps of aerobic glycolysis and adolescent development of functional connectivity; predicted intermediate probabilities of psychosis in siblings; and replicated in the third case-control study.
Conclusions: ML most accurately distinguished cases from controls by a replicable pattern of fMRI connectivity features, highlighting abnormal hubness of cortical nodes in an anatomical pattern consistent with the concept of psychosis as a disorder of network development.","/content/10.1101/19009894v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009894v1.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism is not risk factor for bipolar disorder","Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a psychiatric disease, characterized by the cycles of mania and depression. Several genetic studies investigated BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism as risk factor for BPD, but results were inconclusive. Therefore, present meta-analysis was performed to reevaluate the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and BPD association. Four databases (Pubmed, Springer Link, Science Direct and Google Scholar) were searched for eligible studies up to March 31,2018. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to estimate the strength of the association. All statistical analyses were done by MetaAnalyst and Mix program. Forty studies with a total of 28,787 subjects (10,085 cases and 18,702 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, pooled analysis indicated that there was no significant association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and BPD risk under all five genetic models (ORA vs.G =0.99, 95%CI= 0.94-1.03, p=0.49; ORAG vs. GG= 0.1.02, 95%CI= 0.95-1.07, p= 0.57; ORAA vs. GG = 0.98, 95%CI=0.89-1.08, p=0.75; ORAA+AG vs. GG= 1.0, 95%CI= 0.94-1.06, p= 0.89;ORAA vs. AG+GG= 0.96, 95%CI= 0.89-1.05, p= 0.47). Similarly, no significant association was observed in ethnicity based  subgroup analysis in both Asian and Caucasian population. However, significant association was found in subtype analysis between BDNF Val66Met and BPDII (ORAA+AG vs. GG= 1.21, 95%CI= 1.06-1.37, p= 0.003) but not with BPDI. These findings suggested that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism confer  no genetic susceptibility to BPD I but risk for BPDII.","/content/10.1101/19010280v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010280v1.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Co-circulation and misdiagnosis led to underestimation of the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic in the Americas","During the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic, dengue and chikungunya -- two other viral diseases with the same vector as Zika -- were also in circulation. Clinical presentation of these diseases can vary from person to person in terms of symptoms and severity, making it difficult to differentially diagnose them. Under these circumstances, it is possible that numerous cases of Zika could have been misdiagnosed as dengue or chikungunya, or vice versa. Given the importance of surveillance data for informing epidemiological analyses, our aim was to quantify the potential extent of misdiagnosis during this epidemic. Using basic principles of probability and empirical estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, we generated revised estimates of Zika incidence that accounted for the accuracy of diagnoses made on the basis of clinical presentation with or without molecular confirmation. Applying this method to weekly incidence data from 43 countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, we estimated that 1,062,821 (95% CrI: 1,014,428-1,104,794) Zika cases occurred during this epidemic, which is 56.4% (95% CrI: 49.3-62.6%) more than the 679,743 cases diagnosed as Zika. Our results imply that misdiagnosis was more common in countries with proportionally higher incidence of dengue and chikungunya, such as Brazil.","/content/10.1101/19010256v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010256v1.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Epidemiology

"Digital nuclear morphometry correlates to BAP-1 expression, gene expression class and metastasis-free survival in uveal melanoma","Cytologic features such as the shape and size of tumor cells can predict metastatic death in uveal melanoma, but suffer from poor reproducibility. In this study, we investigate the interobserver concordance of digital morphometry, and correlate the results with established prognostic markers. The average number of cells analyzed in each of 27 tumors, was 1957 (SD 349). Mean time consumption was less than 2.5 minutes per tumor. Identical morphometric classification was obtained for = 85 % of tumors in all twelve evaluated morphometric variables (<U+03BA> 0.70-0.93). The mean nucleus area, nucleus perimeter, nucleus max caliper and nucleus to cell area ratio were significantly greater in tumors with low nuclear BRCA associated protein-1 expression (nBAP-1) and gene expression class 2. Patients had significantly shorter metastasis-free survival if their tumors had low nBAP-1 expression (Log-Rank p=0.002), gene expression class 2 (Log-Rank p=0.004) or tumor cell nuclei with long max calipers (Log-Rank p=0.004) as defined in a training cohort and then tested in a validation cohort. We conclude that digital morphometry can be fast and highly reproducible, that for the first time, morphometry parameters can be objectively quantitated in thousands of cells at a time, and that variables describing the shape and size of the nuclei correlate to nBAP-1 expression, gene expression class and prognosis in uveal melanoma.","/content/10.1101/19010215v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010215v1.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Ophthalmology

"Endocrine therapy use and the risk of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors: two cohort studies in the UK and US","Objective: Examine the effect of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors on 12 clinically relevant individual cardiovascular outcomes in postmenopausal female breast cancer survivors using large-scale datasets from the UK and US.

Design: Two prospective cohort studies 

Setting: Population-based using data from the UK Clinical Practice Datalink linked with Hospital Episode Statistics (2002-2016), and the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database (2008-2013).

Participants: 10005 and 22027 postmenopausal women with breast cancer in the UK and US respectively.

Exposures: Aromatase inhibitor compared with tamoxifen use; the US cohort additionally included a comparison with an unexposed group of women with oestrogen or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer but no endocrine therapy use.

Outcomes: 12 clinically relevant individual cardiovascular outcomes (and two composite coronary and venous thromboembolic outcomes)

Results: In both the UK and the US, there was evidence of an increased risk of coronary artery disease in aromatase inhibitor compared with tamoxifen users (UK incidence rate: 10.18 vs 6.87 per 1000 person-years, HR: 1.29, 0.94-1.76; US incidence rate: 35.26 vs 26.95 per 1000 person-years, HR: 1.29, 1.06-1.55), but the US data showed no increase in risk compared with the unexposed group (incidence rate for tamoxifen vs unexposed: 26.95 vs 38.70 per 1000 person-years, HR: 0.74, 0.60-0.92; incidence rate for aromatase inhibitors vs unexposed: 35.26 vs 28.70, HR: 0.96, 0.83-1.10). Similar patterns were seen for other cardiovascular outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, and valvular heart disease. As expected, there were more venous thromboembolic events in tamoxifen users compared with both aromatase inhibitor users and those unexposed. There was a high degree of consistency between results in the two countries. 

Conclusions: Increased risks of several cardiovascular diseases among aromatase inhibitor compared with tamoxifen users appeared to be driven by protective effects of tamoxifen, rather than toxic effects of aromatase inhibitors. We also confirmed the known increased risk of venous thromboembolic events in tamoxifen users.","/content/10.1101/19010223v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010223v1.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Epidemiology

We apply DeepProg on 32 cancer datasets from TCGA and identified multiple cancer survival subtypes. Patient survival risk-stratification based on DeepProg is significantly better (p-value=7.9e-7 log-rank test) than Similarity Network Fusion based multi-omics data integration in all cancer types. Further comprehensive pan-cancer comparative analysis unveils the genomic signatures common among all the poorest survival subtypes, with genes enriched in extracellular matrix modeling, immune deregulation, and mitosis processes. Furthermore, models built on closely related cancer types using DeepProg are predictive of the subtypes of some other cancers, demonstrating the utility of DeepProg for transfer learning.","/content/10.1101/19010082v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010082v1.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Evaluation of the General Practice Pharmacist (GPP) intervention to optimise prescribing in Irish primary care: a non-randomised pilot study","Objective: Limited evidence suggests integration of pharmacists into the general practice team could improve medicines management for patients, particularly those with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. This study aimed to develop and assess the feasibility of an intervention involving pharmacists, working within general practices, to optimise prescribing in Ireland. 
Design: Non-randomised pilot study 
Setting: Primary care in Ireland
Participants: Four general practices, purposively sampled and recruited to reflect a range of practice sizes and demographic profiles. 
Intervention: A pharmacist joined the practice team for six months (10 hours/week) and undertook medication reviews (face-to-face or chart-based) for adult patients, provided prescribing advice, supported clinical audits, and facilitated practice-based education. 
Outcome measures: Anonymised practice-level medication (e.g. medication changes) and cost data were collected. Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) data were collected on a subset of older adults (aged =65 years) with polypharmacy using patient questionnaires, before and six weeks after medication review by the pharmacist. 
Results: Across four practices, 787 patients were identified as having 1,521 prescribing issues by the pharmacists. Issues relating to potentially inappropriate or high-risk prescribing were addressed most often by the prescriber (51.8%), compared to cost-related issues (7.5%). Medication changes made during the study equated to approximately â‚¬57,000 in cost savings assuming they persisted for 12 months. Ninety-six patients aged =65 years with polypharmacy were recruited from the four practices for PROM data collection and 64 (66.7%) were followed up. There were no changes in patients' treatment burden or attitudes to deprescribing following medication review, and there were conflicting changes in patients' self-reported quality of life. 
Conclusions: This non-randomised pilot study demonstrated that an intervention involving pharmacists, working within general practices is feasible to implement and has potential to improve prescribing quality. This study provides rationale to conduct a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this intervention.","/content/10.1101/19009910v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009910v1.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Primary Care Research

"Association Between Blood Circulating Vitamin D and Colorectal Cancer Risk in Asian Countries: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-analysis","Objectives:
We conducted this dose-response meta-analysis to assess the association between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and colorectal cancer risk in Asian population. 
Design:
This study was a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis for observational studies which investigated the relationship between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and colorectal cancer risk in Asian population.
Data Sources:
Relevant studies were identified by searching literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science until 31 January 2019. Eligibility criteria: original studies published in peer-reviewed journals investigating association between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and the risk of colorectal cancer and/or adenoma in Asian countries.

Data extraction and synthesis:
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. Study-specific ORs were pooled using a random-effects model. A dose-response meta-analysis was performed with generalized least squares regression. We applied the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) quality assessment tool to evaluate the quality of the selected observational studies.
Results:
The eight included studies encompassed a total of 2,916 cases and 6,678 controls. The pooled ORs of colorectal cancer for the highest versus lowest categories of blood circulating Vitamin D levels was 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58-0.97] up to 36.5 ng/mL in Asian population. There was heterogeneity among the studies (I2=53.9%, Pheterogeneity=0.034). The dose-response meta-analysis indicated a significant linear relationship (Pnon-linearity=0.11). An increment of 16 ng/mL in blood circulating Vitamin D level corresponded to an OR of 0.79 [95% CI, 0.64-0.97]. 
Conclusions:
The results of this meta-analysis indicated that blood circulating Vitamin D level is associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer in Asian countries. This dose-response meta-analysis further shows that the strength of this association among Asian population is similar to that among Western population. Our study suggested that Asian population should improve nutritional status and maintain a higher level of blood circulating Vitamin D.","/content/10.1101/19000828v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000828v1.full.pdf","2019-10-25","Oncology

"Direct medical costs of hospitalized patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in China","Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause. The incidence of IPF is increasing year by year, as well as the mortality rates, which is really a burden both for the family and the society. However few data concerning the economic burden of the patients with IPF is available, especially in China. 
Objective
This study aimed to examine the direct medical costs of hospitalized patients with IPF and to determine the contributing factors. 
Methods
This retrospective analysis used the cost-of-illness framework in order to analyze the direct medical costs of patients with IPF. The study used data from the pneumology department of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University from year 2012 to 2015. The direct medical costs included drug fee, auxiliary examination fee, treatment fee and other fee. Patients' characteristics, medical treatment, and the direct medical costs were analyzed by descriptive statistics and multivariable regression.
Results
There were 219 hospitalized patients meeting the diagnosis of IPF, 91% male. The mean age was 65 years old. For the direct medical costs of hospitalized patients with IPF, the mean(SD) of the total costs per IPF patient per admission was 14882.3 (30975.8)CNY. The largest parts were the examination fee of 6034.5 (15651.2)CNY and the drug fee of 5048.9 (3855.1)CNY. By regression analysis we found that length of stay , emergency treatment, ventilator use and being a Beijing native were significantly (P<0.05) associated with total hospitalization costs, and the length of stay had the biggest impact. Complications or comorbidities contributated to the direct medical costs as follows: respiratory failure with 30898.3CNY ( P=0.004), pulmonary arterial hypertension(PAH) with 26898.2CNY (P=0.098), emphysema with 25368.3CNY ( P=0.033), and high blood pressure with 24659.4CNY (P=0.026). Using DLCO or DLCO% pred to reflect the severity of IPF, there was no significant correlation between DLCO or DLCO% pred and patients' direct medical costs. While, the worse the diffusion function, the higher the drug fee.
Conclusion
This study showed that IPF has a major impact on the direct medical costs. Thus, appropriate long-term interventions are recommended to lower the economic burden of IPF.","/content/10.1101/19010025v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010025v1.full.pdf","2019-10-24","Health Economics

"Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI polymorphisms and osteoporosis risk: a meta-analysis","Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by low bone density. The prevalence of osteoporosis varies between different populations and ethnic groups. Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between VDR gene polymorphisms  and osteoporosis across ethnic populations. Present meta-analysis aims to comprehensively evaluate the influence of common FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI VDR gene polymorphisms and osteoporosis. PubMed, Google Scholar, Springer Link and Elsevier databases were searched for eligible studies and all statistical calculations were performed by Open Meta-Analyst software. Studies investigated BsmI (65 studies; 6,880 case/ 8,049 control), ApaI (31 studies; 3,763 case/ 3,934 control), FokI (18 studies; 1,895 case/ 1,722 control), and TaqI (26 studies; 2,458 case/ 2,895 control) polymorphisms  were included in the present meta-analysis. Results of meta-analysis revealed significant association  between dominant model of FokI (ORff+Ff vs. FF= 1.19, 95% CI= 1.04-1.36, p= 0.01, I2= 39.36%) in overall analysis and recessive model of Caucasian population of TaqI polymorphism (ORTT+Tt vs. tt= 1.35, 95% CI= 1.11-1.63, p= 0.002, I2= 50.07%). While no such effect is found in any other genetic model in any other gene polymorphisms of the overall analyses or sub-group analyses. In conclusion, we found the FokI polymorphism is associated with osteoporosis in overall analysis, also the TaqI polymorphism is a risk factor for the Caucasian population.","/content/10.1101/19009746v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009746v1.full.pdf","2019-10-24","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Micro-costing Diagnostics in Oncology: From Single-Gene Testing to Whole Genome Sequencing","Purpose: Predictive diagnostics play an increasingly important role in personalized medicine for cancer treatment. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) based treatment selection is expected to rapidly increase worldwide. Detailed and comparative cost analyses of diagnostic techniques are an essential element in decision-making. This study aimed to calculate and compare the total cost of currently used diagnostic techniques and of WGS in treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), melanoma, colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in the Netherlands.
Methods: The activity-based costing (ABC) method was conducted to calculate the total cost of included diagnostic techniques based on data provided by Dutch pathology laboratories and the Dutch centralized cancer WGS facility. Costs were allocated to four categories: capital costs, maintenance costs, software costs and operational costs. Outcome measures were total cost per cancer patient per included technique, and the total cost per cancer patient per most commonly applied technique (combination) for each cancer type. 
Results: The total cost per cancer patient per technique varied from  58 euro (Sanger sequencing, 3 amplicons) to  4738 euro (paired tumor-normal WGS). The operational costs accounted for the vast majority over 90 % of the total per cancer patient technique costs. The most important operational cost drivers were consumables followed by personnel (for sample preparation and primary data analysis). 
Conclusion: This study outlined in detail all costing aspects and cost prices of current and new diagnostic modalities used in treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, CRC and GIST in the Netherlands. Detailed cost differences and value comparisons between these diagnostic techniques enable future economic evaluations to support decision-making on implementation of WGS and other diagnostic modalities in routine clinical practice.","/content/10.1101/19009969v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009969v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS FOR HPV MITIGATION STRATEGIES IMPLEMENTED IN 2018 IN THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA BASED ON INFECTIOUS DISEASE MODELLING","Human papillomavirus (HPV), is a sexually transmittable virus infection, which is necessary risk factor for developing cervical cancer, first killer in working age women in Moldova. Since 2018 Moldova has modified screening program and vaccination program (mainly externally funded). To assess the performance of the mitigation policy we propose cost-effectiveness analysis according to 2 already implemented strategies. (1) Vaccination of a single age-cohort, although vaccinating a single cohort may not have a substantial effect in other countries with distinct socio-economic situation. (2) Transition to more technologically advance screening ecosystem (changing from Romanowski to Pap smear), which might not necessary be cost-efficient in low resource settings (if GDP per capita will not growth substantially at the same time).  
(1)We verified that single cohort vaccination is both cost-beneficial (total costs reduction will balance intervention costs around the year 2040) and cost-efficient (with incremental impact in 20 years perspective on the level of 2300 EUR/QALY). Moreover, we found out that single year cohort is more beneficial than 5-years cohort vaccination scenarios in our mathematical model. This behaviour could be explained by a transitional situation in Moldova (HPV epidemic is near outbreak threshold), still small changes of model parameters and initial conditions could cause strong effect in the epidemiology. However, a definitive answer cannot be given with the chosen methodology.
(2)Transition between Romanowski -> Pap smear cytology in screening benefits unquestionably in epidemiology e.g. due to higher specificity. However, further maintenance and higher procedure costs could exceed treatment costs, hence intervention costs would gather unacceptable share in whole national limited resources dedicated to public health.","/content/10.1101/19009886v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009886v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Epidemiology

"Cataract in the human lens: a systematic review of proteomic studies ID#008979","Purpose: The aim of this systematic review is to identify all the available data on human lens proteomics with a critical role to age-related cataract formation in order to elucidate the physiopathology of the aging lens.
Materials and methods: We searched on Medline and Cochrane databases. The search generated 328 manuscripts. We included nine original proteomic studies that investigated human cataractous lenses. 
Results: Deamidation was the major age-related post-translational modification. There was a significant increase in the amount of aA-crystallin D-isoAsp58 present at all ages, while an increase in the extent of Trp oxidation was apparent in cataract lenses when compared to aged normal lenses. During aging, enzymes with oxidized cysteine at critical sites included GAPDH, glutathione synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and PARK7. 
Conclusion: D-isoAsp in aA crystallin could be associated with the development of age-related cataract in human, by contributing to the denaturation of a crystallin, and decreasing its ability to act as a chaperone. Oxidation of Trp may be associated with nuclear cataract formation in man, while the role of oxidant stress in age-related cataract formation is dominant.","/content/10.1101/19009035v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009035v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Ophthalmology

"Profiles of cognitive change in preclinical Alzheimer's disease using change-point analysis","Introduction: Change-point analyses are increasingly used to identify the temporal stages of accelerated cognitive decline in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, statistical comparisons of change-points between specific cognitive measures have not been reported. 
Methods: 165 older adults (baseline age range: 61.1-91.2) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging developed AD during follow-up. Linear and non-linear mixed models were fit for 11 cognitive measures to determine change-points in rates of decline before AD diagnosis. Bootstrapping was used to compare the timing of change-points across cognitive measures.
Results: Change-points followed by accelerated decline ranged from 15.5 years (Card Rotations) to 1.9 years (Trail-Making A) before AD diagnosis. Accelerated decline in Card Rotations occurred significantly earlier than all other measures, including learning and memory measures.
Discussion: Results suggest that visuospatial ability, as assessed by Card Rotations, may have the greatest utility as an early predictive tool in identifying preclinical AD.","/content/10.1101/19009696v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009696v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Presence of additional P. vivax malaria in Duffy negative individuals from Southwestern Nigeria","Malaria in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) is thought to be hugely caused by Plasmodium falciparum and very infrequently by P. ovale, P. malariae, with P. vivax not even being considered to be of any significant role. However, with the availability of very sensitive diagnostic tool, it has become more clear that, the percentage of non-falciparum malaria in this sub-region has been underestimated. P. vivax was historically thought to be absent in sSA due to the high prevalence of the Duffy null antigen in individuals residing here. Nevertheless, recent studies reporting the detection of vivax malaria in Duffy-negative individuals challenges this notion.  Following our earlier report of P. vivax in Duffy-negative individuals, we have re-assessed all previous samples following the classical PCR method and sequencing to confirm both single/mixed infections as well as the Duffy status of the individuals.
Interestingly, fifteen additional Plasmodium infections were detected, representing 5.9% in prevalence from our earlier work. In addition, P. vivax represents 26.7% (4/15) of the new isolates collected in Nigeria. Sequencing results confirmed, all vivax isolates as truly vivax malaria and their Duffy status to be that of the Duffy-negative genotype. The identification of more vivax isolates among these Duffy-negative individuals from Nigeria, substantiate the expanding body of evidence of the ability of P. vivax to infect RBCs that do not express the DARC gene. Hence, such geno-epidemiological study should be conducted at the national level in order to evaluate the actual burden of P. vivax in the country.","/content/10.1101/19009837v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009837v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Epidemiology

"Beware (surprisingly common) left-right flips in your MRI data: an efficient and robust method to check using AFNI","Knowing the difference between left and right is generally assumed throughout the brain MRI research community. However, we note rather widespread occurrences of left-right orientation errors in MRI open database repositories where volumes have contained systematic left-right flips due to having incorrect or missing file header information. Here we present a simple method in AFNI for determining the consistency of left and right within a subject's acquired volumes; the method contains both a quantitative evaluation as well as a visualizable verification. We test the functionality using publicly available datasets.  Left-right flipping is not immediately obvious in most cases, so we also present visualization methods for looking at this problem (and other potential problems), using examples from both FMRI and DTI datasets.","/content/10.1101/19009787v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009787v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Radiology and Imaging

"Sensory restoration by epidural stimulation of dorsal spinal cord in upper-limb amputees","Restoring somatosensory feedback to people with limb amputations is crucial for improving prosthesis acceptance and function. Epidural spinal cord stimulation is a commonly used clinical procedure that targets sensory neural pathways in the dorsal spinal cord to treat pain conditions. A similar approach could be developed as a clinically translatable means to restore somatosensation in amputees. We show that epidural stimulation of the dorsal spinal cord evoked sensory percepts, perceived as emanating from the amputated arm and hand, in four people with upper-limb amputation. After an initial caudal movement immediately following the implantation, the leads stabilized, exhibiting a median migration of <5 mm (each electrode contact is 3 mm long) over the remainder of the study in all the subjects. This was reflected in the consistent locations of evoked percepts in the hand across four subjects throughout the period of implantation, which lasted up to 29 days. The median change in the centroid location was 1.2 to 35.3 mm and the median change in percept area was 0 to 40%. While most of the evoked percepts were paresthetic in nature, a subset was described as naturalistic (e.g. touch or pressure) in three subjects. Modulating the stimulus amplitude affected the perceived intensity of the sensation in all subjects. A variety of sensory percepts were evoked in all subjects irrespective of the level of amputation or the time since amputation, suggesting the approach is amenable to a diverse population of amputees.","/content/10.1101/19009811v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009811v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Evaluation of a brief intervention to reduce cell phone use in college students","Background. Excessive cell phone use contributes to distracted driving, may increase the risk for automobile accidents, and a minority of mobile phone users exhibit behaviors consistent with technological addiction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cell phone beliefs and behaviors could be changed by a brief educational encounter. The Theory of Reasoned Action provided a lens for viewing attitudes and behavior.

Methods. A one-week pre-post design with a thirty-day follow-up was used with participants (N = 215, 67.0% female, age = 20.0 + 1.6) assigned to a peer-led intervention or comparison groups. The intervention included cell-phone educational materials. A short index of cell phone behavior was developed which showed good internal consistency with a Cronbachs alpha of .81. 

Results. The intervention group agreed or strongly-agreed more than the comparison group on five of the seven areas of cell phone beliefs and behaviors ( p < 0.05, item Cohens d = .32 to .47, total d = .50) at one-week following receipt of informational materials. 

Discussion. We conclude that attitudes and behaviors regarding cell phones are malleable and susceptible to change in young-adults following a brief psychoeducational intervention.","/content/10.1101/19009241v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009241v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Epidemiology

"Improved Alzheimer's disease versus frontotemporal lobar degeneration differential diagnosis combining EEG and neurochemical biomarkers","Introduction:
Distinguishing between two of the most common causes of dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), on clinical diagnostic criteria alone has poor diagnostic accuracy. Promising tools to increase the diagnostic accuracy of AD are the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and electroencephalography (EEG), which is being investigated as a diagnostic tool for neurodegenerative brain disorders. In this study, we investigated the utility of EEG-based biomarkers in comparison and in addition to established neurochemical biomarkers in the AD versus FTLD differential diagnosis.
Methods:
Our study cohort comprised 37 AD and 32 FTLD patients, of which 19 AD and 11 FTLD had definite diagnoses. All these participants had CSF biomarker analyses resulting in four neurochemical (NCM) biomarkers (AÃŸ1-42, T-tau, P-tau181 and Nf-L) and underwent 19-channel resting-state EEG. From the EEG spectra, dominant frequency peaks (DFP) were extracted in four regions resulting in four dominant frequencies (in left-temporal, frontal, right-temporal and parieto-occipital regions). This yielded a total of eight features (4 NCM + 4 EEG), which we used to train and test a classifier and assess the diagnostic value of the markers separately (using only the NCM or EEG subset) and combined.
Results:
The classification accuracies were much higher when training and testing on the definite subgroup than on the whole group. Furthermore, we found that the NCM feature subset allowed a better accuracy than the EEG feature subset, both when training and testing on the whole group (NCM 82% vs EEG 72%), as on the definite group only (92% vs 86%). Using both feature subsets together increased the accuracy to 86% in the whole group and 94% in the definite subgroups. Another interesting finding was the presence of two spectral peaks in a considerable number of patients in both groups.
Conclusion:
Combining EEG with neurochemical biomarkers resulted in differential diagnostic accuracies of 86% in clinically diagnosed AD and FTD patients and of 94% in patients having a definite diagnosis. Furthermore, we found evidence that the slowing down of the dominant EEG rhythm might be a gradual appearance of a slow rhythm and fading out of the normal ground rhythm, rather than a gradual slowing down of the ground rhythm. Finally, we have discovered two differences in the occurrence of the dominant EEG frequency: people lacking a clear dominant peak almost all had definite AD, while people with two peaks more often had FTLD. These unexpected but interesting findings need to be explored further.","/content/10.1101/19009316v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009316v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Neurology

"Randomized controlled trial combining constraint-induced movement therapy and action-observation training in unilateral cerebral palsy: clinical effects and influencing factors of treatment response.","Introduction. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) improves upper limb (UL) motor execution in unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP). As these children also show motor planning deficits, action-observation training (AOT) might be of additional value. Here, we investigated the combined effect of AOT to CIMT and identified factors influencing treatment response. Methods. Forty-four children with uCP (mean 9y6m, SD 1y10m) participated in a 9-day camp wearing a splint for 6 hours/day and were allocated to the CIMT+AOT (n=22) and the CIMT+placebo group (n=22). The CIMT+AOT group received 15 hours of AOT (i.e. video-observation) and executed the observed tasks, whilst the CIMT+AOT group watched videos free of biological motion and executed the same tasks. The primary outcome measure was bimanual performance. Secondary outcomes included measures at body function and activity level assessed before (T1), after (T2) the intervention, and at 6 months follow-up (T3). Influencing factors included behavioural and neurological characteristics. Results. Although no between-groups differences were found (p>0.05), the addition of AOT led to higher gains in children with initially poorer bimanual performance (p=0.02). Both groups improved in all outcome measures after the intervention and retained the gains at follow up (p<0.01). Poor sensory function resulted in larger improvements in the total group (p=0.03) and high amount of mirror movements tended to result in better response to the additional AOT training (p=0.06). Improvements were similar irrespective of the type of brain lesion or corticospinal tract wiring pattern. Conclusions. Adding AOT to CIMT, resulted in better outcome for children with poor motor function and high amount of mirror movements. CIMT with or without AOT seems to be more beneficial for children with poor sensory function.

"Independent and Joint Associations of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activity with Cardiometabolic Health Markers in the 1970 British Birth Cohort","Objective
To examine the independent and joint associations thigh-worn accelerometry assessed sedentary time and moderate to vigorous physical activity with cardiometabolic health markers.
Design
Cross-sectional study embedded in the age-46 wave an established birth cohort, the 1970 British Birth Cohort.
Setting
Population-based sample from Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales). 
Methods
Outcome measures included: body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and c-reactive protein. Sedentary behavior and other physical activity exposures, recorded by a thigh-worn activPAL3 accelerometry, included: daily sedentary time, breaks in sedentary time, daily time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Multiple linear regression analyses, multiple logistic regression analyses, and general linear models were conducted as applicable.
Results
4,634 participants were available for the final analysis. After adjusting for potential confounders and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, daily sedentary time was positively associated with triglycerides (ÃŸ=0.052 [0.015, 0.089]) and inversely associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ÃŸ=-0.015 [-0.022, -0.010]). Daily prolonged sedentary time (= 60 minutes) was positively associated with both glycated hemoglobin and log-transformed c-reactive protein (ÃŸ=0.240 [0.030, 0.440] and 0.026 [0.007, 0.045], respectively) and inversely associated with systolic blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ÃŸ=-0.450 [-0.760, -0.150] and -0.013 [-0.022, -0.003], respectively). After adjusting for potential confounders and daily sedentary time, daily breaks in sedentary time were inversely associated with glycated hemoglobin (ÃŸ=-0.020 [-0.037, -0.003]), and positively associated with both triglycerides and systolic blood pressure (ÃŸ=0.006 [0.002, 0.010] and 0.030 [0.002, 0.050], respectively). The joint associations of prolonged sedentary time and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with the prevalence of diabetes were not statistically significant.
Conclusion
Prolonged sedentary time (= 60 minutes) and daily breaks in sedentary time were deleteriously associated with glycated hemoglobin, although we found no evidence that there were joint moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sitting associations.","/content/10.1101/19009738v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009738v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Epidemiology

"Effects of combining constraint-induced movement therapy and action-observation training on upper limb kinematics in children with unilateral cerebral palsy: A randomized controlled trial.","Modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) improves upper limb (UL) motor execution in unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP). As these children also show motor planning deficits, action-observation training (AOT) might be of additional value. Here, we investigated the combined value of AOT to mCIMT on UL kinematics in children with uCP. Thirty-six children with uCP completed an UL kinematic evaluation after participating in a 9-day mCIMT camp wearing a splint for 6 hours/day. The experimental group (mCIMT+AOT, n=20) received 15 hours of AOT, i.e. video-observation and execution of unimanual tasks. The control group (mCIMT+placebo, n=16) watched biological-motion free videos and executed the same tasks. We examined changes in motor control (movement duration, peak velocity, time-to-peak velocity, and trajectory straightness) and movement patterns (using Statistical Parametric Mapping) during the execution of three unimanual, relevant tasks before the intervention, after and at 6 months follow-up. Adding AOT to mCIMT mainly affected movement duration during reaching, whereas little benefit is seen on UL movement patterns. mCIMT, with or without AOT, improved peak velocity and trajectory straightness, and proximal movement patterns. These results highlight the importance of including kinematics in an UL evaluation to capture changes in motor control and movement patterns of the proximal joints.","/content/10.1101/19009779v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009779v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Increased Mortality in Patients with Standard EEG Findings of â€œDiffuse Slowingâ€","Background/Objectives:  We aim to confirm the association between the high risk score on bispectral electroencephalogram (BSEEG) and mortality by comparing outcomes for those with â€œdiffuse slowingâ€ and normal findings on standard EEG. 

Design: This is a retrospective study conducted with patient chart data from March 2015 to March 2017.

Setting: Single center study at a tertiary care academic hospital in the Midwest region of the USA.

Participants: 1069 subjects aged 55 years and older who were on an inpatient floor or intensive care unit and received a standard 24-hour EEG.  

Measurements: Primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30-, 90-, 180-, and 365- days. Secondary outcomes were time-to-discharge, and discharge to home.

Results: Patients with â€œdiffuse slowingâ€ on standard EEG was significantly associated with 30-, 90-, 180-, and 365-day mortality (P < .001) compared to those with normal EEG findings when controlling for age, sex, and Carlson Comorbidity Index.  Those with diffuse slowing also had a longer time to discharge (P < 0.001) and were less likely to discharge to home (P < 0.001) when controlling for the same factors. Findings were similar when limiting the study to only patients whose clinical status indicated â€œawakeâ€ at time of EEG, except for 30-day mortality.  

Conclusion:  Our findings show that a standard EEG finding of â€œdiffuse slowingâ€ for inpatients 55 year or older is associated with greater mortality.  This study strengthens the importance of the association found between high BSEEG score and mortality.","/content/10.1101/19009621v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009621v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Point-of-care serodiagnostic test for early-stage Lyme disease using a multiplexed paper-based immunoassay and machine learning","Caused by the tick-borne spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne infectious disease in North America and Europe. Though timely diagnosis and treatment are effective in preventing disease progression, current tests are insensitive in early-stage LD, with a sensitivity <50%. Additionally, the serological testing currently recommended by the US Center for Disease Control has high costs (>$400/test) and extended sample-to-answer timelines (>24 hours). To address these challenges, we created a cost-effective and rapid point-of-care (POC) test for early-stage LD that assays for antibodies specific to seven Borrelia antigens and a synthetic peptide in a paper-based multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA). We trained a deep learning-based diagnostic algorithm to select an optimal subset of antigen/peptide targets, and then blindly-tested our xVFA using human samples (N(+) = 42, N(-)= 54), achieving an area-under-the-curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of 0.950, 90.5%, and 87.0% respectively, outperforming previous LD POC tests. With batch-specific standardization and threshold tuning, the specificity of our blind-testing performance improved to 96.3%, with an AUC and sensitivity of 0.963 and 85.7%, respectively.","/content/10.1101/19009423v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009423v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Pathology

"Impact of a natural disaster on access to care and biopsychosocial outcomes among Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors","Cancer is the leading cause of death in Puerto Rico (PR). Hurricane Maria (HM) and its aftermath lead to widespread devastation in the island, including the collapse of the healthcare system. Medically fragile populations, such as cancer survivors, were significantly affected. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of HM on barriers to care, emotional distress, and inflammatory biomarkers among cancer survivors in PR. This exploratory longitudinal study was conducted in health care facilities and community support groups from PR. Cancer survivors (n=50) and non-cancer participants (n=50) completed psychosocial questionnaires and provided blood samples that were used to assess inflammatory cytokines levels. Data were analyzed through descriptive, frequencies, correlational, and linear regression analyses. Cancer survivors that were affected by HM reported increased barriers in accessing medical care, which were directly associated with anxiety, perceived stress, and post-traumatic symptomatology. Moreover, being a cancer survivor, along with closeness in time from HM predicted more barriers to receiving health care. Several inflammatory cytokines, such as CD31, BDNF, TFF3, Serpin E-1, Vitamin D BP, VCAM-1, Osteopontin, Chitinase 3 like 1, MMP-9 and MIF were significantly upregulated in cancer survivors while BDNF, MMP9 and Osteopontin had significant positive correlations with barriers to care. HM significantly impacted Puerto Ricans psychosocial well-being. Cancer survivors had significant barriers to care and showed increased serum inflammatory cytokines, but did not show differences in anxiety, stress and post-traumatic symptoms compared to non-cancer participants","/content/10.1101/19009704v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009704v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Oncology

"Diffusion Histology Imaging to Improve Lesion Detection and Classification in Multiple Sclerosis","Background: Diagnosing MS through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires extensive clinical experience and tedious work. Furthermore, MRI-indicated MS lesion locations rarely align with the patients' symptoms and often contradict with pathology studies. Our lab has developed and modified a novel diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) technique to address the shortcomings of MRI-based MS diagnoses. Although primary DBSI metrics have been demonstrated to be associated with axonal injury/loss, demyelination and inflammation, a more detailed analysis using multiple DBSI-structural metrics to improve the accuracy of MS lesion detection and differentiation is still needed. Here we report that Diffusion Histology Imaging (DHI), an improved approach that combines a deep neural network (DNN) algorithm with improved DBSI analyses, accurately detected and classified various MS lesion types.
Methods: Thirty-eight multiple sclerosis patients were scanned with T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) using fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) using magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE), magnetization transfer contrast (MTR) imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. The imaging results identified 43,261 voxels from 91 persistent black hole (PBH) lesions, 89 persistent gray hole (PGH) lesions, 16 acute gray hole (AGH) lesions, 189 non-black hole (NBH) lesions and 113 normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) areas. Data extracted from these lesions were randomly split into training, validation, and testing groups with an 8:1:1 ratio. The DNN was constructed with 10 fully-connected hidden layers using TensorFlow 2.0 in Python. Batch normalization and dropout regularization were used for model optimization. 
Results: Each MS lesion type had unique DBSI derived diffusion metric profiles. Based on these DBSI diffusion metric profiles, DHI achieved a 93.6% overall concordance with neurologist determinations of all five MS lesions, compared with 74.3% from conventional MRI (cMRI)-DNN model, 78.2% from MTR-DNN model, and 80% from DTI-DNN model. DHI also achieved greater performances on detecting individual MS lesion types compared to other models. Specifically, DHI showed great  performances on prediction of PBH (AUC: 0.991; F1-score: 0.923), PGH (AUC: 0.977; F1-score: 0.823) and AGH (AUC: 0.987; F1-score: 0.887), which significantly outperformed other models.
Conclusions: DHI significantly improves the detection and classification accuracy for various MS lesion types, which could greatly aid the clinical decisions of neurologists and neuroradiologists. The efficacy and efficiency of this DNN model shows great promise for clinical application.","/content/10.1101/19009126v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009126v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Neurology

"Dissecting the association of C-reactive protein levels with PTSD, traumatic events, and social support","Inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) have been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic experience, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We investigated the association among CRP, PTSD, and traits related to traumatic events and social support using genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (30,000 cases and 170,000 controls), the UK Biobank (UKB; up to 117,900 individuals), and the CHARGE study (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology, 148,164 individual). Linkage disequilibrium score regression, polygenic risk scoring, and two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were used to investigate genetic overlap and causal relationships. Genetic correlations of CRP were observed with PTSD (rg=0.16, p=0.026) and behavioral and emotional response to trauma, exposure to traumatic events, and the presence of social support (-0.28<rg<0.20; p<0.008). We observed a bidirectional association between CRP and PTSD (CRP->PTSD: beta=0.065, p=0.015; PTSD->CRP: beta=0.008, p=0.009). CRP also showed a negative association on the 'felt loved as a child' trait (UKB, beta;=-0.017, p=0.008). Due to the known association of socioeconomic status (SES) on PTSD and social support, a multivariable MR was performed to investigate SES as potential mediator. We found that household income (univariate MR: beta=-0.22, p=1.57x10-7; multivariate MR: beta=-0.17, p=0.005) and deprivation index (univariate MR: beta=0.38, p=1.63x10-9; multivariate MR: beta=0.27, p=0.016) were driving the causal estimates of 'felt loved as a child' and CRP on PTSD. The present findings highlight a bidirectional association between PTSD and CRP levels, also suggesting a potential role of SES in the interplay between childhood support and inflammatory processes with respect to PTSD risk.","/content/10.1101/19009134v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009134v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"German Recommendations for Physical Activity and Physical Activity Promotion in Adults with Noncommunicable Diseases","Background: The objective of this study was to develop evidence-based recommendations for physical activity (PA) and PA promotion for German adults (18-65 years) with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).

Methods: The PA recommendations were developed based on existing PA recommendations and using a three-phased process. In phase 1, systematic literature searches were conducted for current PA recommendations for seven chronic conditions (osteoarthrosis of the hip and knee, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stable ischemic heart disease, stroke, clinical depression, and chronic non-specific back pain). In phase 2, the PA recommendations were evaluated on the basis of 28 quality criteria. High-quality recommendations were identified, and a content analysis was conducted on these recommendations. In phase 3, the findings of the content analysis were summarised, and PA recommendations for seven chronic conditions were deducted. The seven recommendations were then synthesised to generate generic German PA recommendations for adults with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). In relation to the recommendations for PA promotion, a systematic literature review was conducted on papers that reviewed the efficacy/effectiveness of interventions for PA promotion in adults with NCDs.

Results: The German Recommendations for Physical Activity state that adults with NCDs should, over the course of a week, should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic PA, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic PA, or a combination of both. Furthermore, muscle-strengthening activities should be performed at least twice a week. The promotion of PA among adults with NCDs should be theory-based, specifically target PA behaviour, and be tailored to the respective target group. In this context, and as an intervention method, exercise referral schemes are one of the more promising methods of promoting PA in adults with NCDs.

Conclusion: The development of evidence-based recommendations for PA and PA promotion is an important step in terms of the initiation and implementation of actions for PA-related health promotion in Germany. The German Recommendations for PA and PA promotion inform adults affected by NCDs and health professionals on how much PA would be optimal for adults with NCDs. Additionally, the recommendations provide professionals entrusted in PA promotion the best strategies and interventions to raise low PA levels in adults with NCDs. The formulation of specific PA recommendations for adults with NCDs and their combination with recommendations on PA promotion is a unique characteristic of the German recommendations.","/content/10.1101/19008953v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008953v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Public and Global Health

"Bringing Critical Race Praxis into the Study of Electrophysiological Substrate of Sudden Cardiac Death: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study","Race is an established risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD). We sought to determine whether the association of electrophysiological (EP) substrate with SCD varies between black and white individuals. Participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study with analyzable ECGs (n=14,408; age 54Â±6 y; 74% white) were included. EP substrate was characterized by traditional 12-lead ECG and vectorcardiographic metrics. Two competing outcomes were adjudicated SCD and non-sudden cardiac death (nonSCD). Interaction of ECG metrics with race was studied in Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risk models, adjusted for prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD), risk factors, and incident non-fatal CVD. At the baseline visit linear regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, and study center, showed black participants had larger Spatial Ventricular Gradient magnitude by 0.30 (95%CI 0.25-0.34) mV, SAI QRST by 18.4 (13.7-23.0) mV*ms, Cornell voltage by 0.30 (95%CI 0.25-0.35) mV than white participants. Over a median follow-up of 24.4 years, SCD incidence was higher in black (2.86; 95%CI 2.50-3.28 per 1000 person-years) than white participants (1.37; 95%CI 1.22-1.53 per 1000 person-years). Black participants with hypertension had the highest rate of SCD: 4.26; 95%CI 3.66-4.96 per 1000 person-years. Race did not modify associations of EP substrate with SCD and nonSCD. EP substrate does not explain racial disparities in SCD rate.","/content/10.1101/19009167v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009167v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Estimating Real World Performance of a Predictive Model: A Case-Study in Predicting End-of-Life","Objective: The main criteria for choosing how models are built is the subsequent effect on future (estimated) model performance. In this work, we evaluate the effects of experimental design choices on both estimated and actual model performance.
Materials and Methods: Four years of hospital admissions are used to develop a 1 year end-of-life prediction model. Two common methods to select appropriate prediction timepoints (backwards-from-outcome and forwards-from-admission) are introduced and combined with two ways of separating cohorts for training and testing (internal and temporal). Two models are trained in identical conditions, and their performances are compared. Finally, operating thresholds are selected in each test set and applied in a final, 'real-world' cohort consisting of one year of admissions.
Results: Backwards-from-outcome cohort selection discards 75% of candidate admissions (n=23,579), whereas forwards-from-admission selection includes many more (n=92,148). Both selection methods produce similar global performances when applied to an internal test set. However, when applied to the temporally defined 'real-world' set, forwards-from-admission yields higher areas under the ROC and precision recall curves (88.3 and 56.5% vs. 83.2 and 41.6%). 
Discussion: A backwards-from-outcome experiment effectively transforms the training data such that it no longer resembles real-world data. This results in optimistic estimates of test set performance, especially at high precision. In contrast, a forwards-from-admission experiment with a temporally separated test set consistently and conservatively estimates real-world performance. 
Conclusion: Experimental design choices impose bias upon selected cohorts. A forwards-from-admission experiment, validated temporally, can conservatively estimate real-world performance.","/content/10.1101/19008821v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008821v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Health Informatics

"Resilience to dominant genetic disease in the healthy elderly","Here we describe genomic screening of the healthy elderly to identify those resilient to adult-onset genetic disease, despite being at exceptionally high genetic risk. We sequenced 13,131 individuals aged 70 or older (mean age 75 years) from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial. Participants had no prior history of cardiovascular disease, life-threatening cancer, persistent physical disability or dementia. We compared the prevalence of pathogenic variants in medically actionable autosomal dominant disease genes with that from the UK Biobank population, and assessed their clinical impact using personal medical history and adjudicated study outcomes during 4.5 years of follow-up. The frequency of pathogenic variants was less than reported among the younger UK Biobank population, suggesting these variants confer a survival disadvantage during the middle years of life. Yet we identified 141 individuals with pathogenic variants free of any associated disease up to average age 79.5 years. Further study of these elderly resilient individuals might help uncover genetic mechanisms that protect against the development of disease.","/content/10.1101/19006932v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006932v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Spatial versus angular resolution for tractography-assisted planning of deep brain stimulation","Given the restricted total scanning time for clinical neuroimaging, it is unclear whether clinical diffusion MRI protocols would benefit more from higher spatial resolution or higher angular resolution. In this work, we investigated the relative benefit of improving spatial or angular resolution in diffusion MRI to separate two parallel running white matter tracts that are targets for deep brain stimulation: the anterior thalamic radiation and the supero-lateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle. Both these tracts are situated in the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule, and recent studies suggest that targeting a specific tract could improve treatment efficacy. Therefore, we scanned 19 healthy volunteers at 3T and 7T according to three diffusion MRI protocols with respectively standard clinical settings, increased spatial resolution of 1.4 mm, and increased angular resolution (64 additional gradient directions at b=2200s/mm2). We performed probabilistic tractography for all protocols and quantified the separability of both tracts. The higher spatial resolution protocol improved separability by 41% with respect to the clinical standard, presumably due to decreased partial voluming. The higher angular resolution protocol resulted in increased apparent tract volumes and overlap, which is disadvantageous for application in precise treatment planning. We thus recommend to increase the spatial resolution for deep brain stimulation planning to 1.4 mm while maintaining angular resolution. This recommendation complements the general advice to aim for high angular resolution to resolve crossing fibers, confirming that the specific application and anatomical considerations are leading in clinical diffusion MRI protocol optimization.","/content/10.1101/19008813v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008813v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"The role of prison-based interventions for hepatitis C virus (HCV) micro-elimination among people who inject drugs in Montreal, Canada","Background: In Canada, hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission primarily occurs among people who inject drugs (PWID) and people with experience in the prison system bear a disproportionate HCV burden. These overlapping groups of individuals have been identified as priority populations for HCV micro-elimination in Canada, a country currently not on track to achieve its elimination targets. Considering the missed opportunities to intervene in provincial prisons, this study aims to estimate the population-level impact of prison-based interventions and post-release risk reduction strategies on HCV transmission among PWID in a high HCV-burdened Canadian city, Montreal.
Methods: A dynamic HCV transmission model among PWID was developed and calibrated to community and prison bio-behavioural surveys in Montreal. Then, the relative impact of prison-based testing and treatment or post-release linkage to care, alone or in combination with risk reduction strategies, was estimated from 2018 to 2030, and compared to a counterfactual status quo scenario.
Results: Testing and linkage to care interventions implemented over 2018-30 could lead to the greatest declines in prevalence (23%; 95% credible interval (CrI): 17-31%), incidence (20%; 95%CrI: 10-28%), and prevent the most new chronic infections (8%; 95%CrI: 4-11%). Testing and treatment in prison lead to slightly lower decreases in prevalence, incidence, and fraction of prevented new chronic infections. Combining test and linkage to care with risk reduction measures could further its epidemiological impact, preventing 10% (95%CrI: 5-16%) of new chronic infections. When implemented concomitantly with community-based treatment scale-up, prison-based interventions had synergistic effects, averting a higher fraction of new chronic infections. 
Conclusion: Offering HCV testing and post-release linkage to care in provincial prisons, where incarcerations are frequent and sentences short, could change the course of the HCV epidemic in Montreal. Integration of post-release risk reduction measures and community-based treatment scale-up could significantly increase the impact of these interventions.","/content/10.1101/19008409v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008409v1.full.pdf","2019-10-21","Health Policy

"Seroprevalence of Varicella Zoster virus in China: an age-stratifed systematic review and meta-analysis","OBJECTIVES: 
the aim of this meta-analysis was pooled on the comprehensive information of the epidemiology of VZV infection and analyzed the seropositivity of VZV-IgG antibodies in different age groups in China, so as to arouse people's attention on VZV.
DESIGN: Systematic review
DATA SOURCES:
Sources included on PubMed, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, WANFANG database and the Chinese Scientific Journals Full-Text Database (CQVIP) from 1997 to 2019.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
(1) the Chinese and English literatures of study on varicella-zoster virus immunization epidemics in different regions of China; (2) The literature has obvious age stratification; (3) The subjects are general people; (4) VZV sero-prevalence in the population investigated by the literature research institute. Exclusion criteria: Any study that did not contain these information was excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS:
Two evaluators independently retrieved documents and extracted data. Information about the study design, eligible population, age and gender distribution, inclusion and exclusion criteria were checked. When they disagreed, they could solve the problem by discussion or by soliciting opinions from third parties.
RESULTS:
Literatures were screened according to the inclusion criteria and 10 studies from 1997 to 2019 with a total of 11666 individuals were included. The overall VZV seroprevalence in the Chinese population was 65.80% (95% CI; 56.5% - 75.1%), and the peak prevalence was seen in the age 36-45 93.50% (95% CI; 0.917-0.953) while the VZV seroprevalence rate (82.20%, 95% CI: 0.544-1.099) was not increased in individuals of 45 and older. 
CONCLUSION:
The incidence of VZV increases with age, and there was no significant difference between different genders or regions. This results can provide epidemiological evidence for the prevention and treatment of VZV.","/content/10.1101/19009449v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009449v1.full.pdf","2019-10-21","Dermatology

"Predicting the required pre-surgery blood volume in surgical patients based on machine learning","Precisely predicting the required pre-surgery blood volume (PBV) in surgical patients is a formidable challenge in China. Inaccurate estimation is associate with excessive costs, postponed surgeries and adverse outcome after surgery due to in sufficient supply or inventory. This study aimed to predict required PBV based on machine learning techniques. 181,027 medical documents over 6 years were cleaned and finally obtained 92,057 blood transfusion records. The blood transfusion and surgery related factors of perioperative patients, surgeons experience volumes and the actual volumes of transfused RBCs were extracted. 6 machine learning algorithms were used to build prediction models. The surgery patients received allogenic RBCs or without transfusion, had total volume less than 10 units, or had the latest laboratory examinations of pre-surgery within 7 days were included, providing 118,823 data points. 39 predictive factors related to the RBCs transfusion were identified. Random forest model was selected to predict the required PBV of RBCs with 72.9% accuracy and strikingly improved the accuracy by 30.4% compared with surgeons experience, where 90% of data was used for training. We tested and demonstrated that both the data-driven models and the random forest model achieved higher accuracy than surgeons experience. Furthermore, we developed a computational tool, PTRBC, to precisely estimate the required PBV in surgical patients and we believe this tool will find more applications in assisting clinician decisions, not only confined to making accurate pre-surgery blood requirement predicting.","/content/10.1101/19008045v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008045v1.full.pdf","2019-10-19","Hematology

"Computational Modeling of Ovarian Cancer: Implications for Therapy and Screening","High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HG-SOC) is a major cause of cancer-related death. Whether treatment order - primary debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (PDS) or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with interval surgery (NACT) - affects outcome is controversial. We developed a mathematical framework that holds for hierarchical or stochastic models of tumor initiation and reproduces HG-SOC clinical course. After estimating parameter values, we infer that most patients harbor chemo-resistant HG-SOC cells at diagnosis, PDS is inherently superior to NACT due to better depletion of resistant cells, and earlier diagnosis could improve survival of primary, but not relapsed, patients. Our predictions are supported by primary clinical data from multiple cohorts. Our results have clear implications for these key issues in HG-SOC management.","/content/10.1101/19009712v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009712v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Oncology

"Development of population and Bayesian models for applied use in patients receiving cefepime","Understanding exposures of cefepime, a ÃŸ-lactam antibiotic, is crucial for developing regimens to achieve optimal exposure and improved clinical outcomes. This study sought to develop and evaluate a unified population pharmacokinetic model in both pediatric and adult patients receiving cefepime treatment. Multiple physiologically relevant models were fit to pediatric and adult subject data. To evaluate the final model performance, a withheld group of twelve pediatric and two separate adult populations were assessed. Seventy subjects with a total of 604 cefepime concentrations were included in this study. All adults (n=34) on average weighed 82.7 kg and displayed a mean creatinine clearance (CrCL) of 106.7 mL/min. All pediatric subjects (n=36) had mean weight and CrCL of 16.0 kg and 195.64 mL/min, respectively. A covariate-adjusted two compartment model described the observed concentrations well (population model R2, 87.0%; Bayesian model R2, 96.5%). In the evaluation subsets, the model performed similarly well (population R2, 84.0%; Bayesian R2, 90.2%). The identified model serves well for population dosing and as a Bayesian prior for precision dosing.","/content/10.1101/19009647v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009647v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Pharmacology and Therapeutics

"Unmasking selective path integration deficits in Alzheimer's disease risk carriers","Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests with progressive memory loss and spatial disorientation. Neuropathological studies suggest early AD pathology in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of young adults at genetic risk for AD (APOE <U+03F5>4-carriers). Because the EC harbors grid cells, a likely neural substrate of path integration (PI), we examined PI performance in APOE <U+03F5>4-carriers during a virtual navigation task. We report a selective impairment in APOE <U+03F5>4-carriers specifically when recruitment of compensatory navigational strategies via supportive spatial cues was disabled. A separate fMRI study revealed that PI performance was associated with the strength of entorhinal grid-like representations, suggesting grid cell dysfunction as a mechanistic explanation for PI deficits in APOE <U+03F5>4-carriers. Furthermore, retrosplenial cortex was involved in the recruitment of compensatory navigational strategies via supportive spatial cues. Our results provide evidence for selective PI deficits in AD risk carriers, decades before potential disease onset.","/content/10.1101/19009662v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009662v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Exploring and mitigating potential bias when genetic instrumental variables are associated with multiple non-exposure traits in Mendelian randomization","Background: Our aim is to produce guidance on exploring and mitigating possible bias when genetic instrumental variables (IVs) associate with traits other than the exposure of interest in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies.    
Methods: We use causal diagrams to illustrate scenarios that could result in IVs being related to (non-exposure) traits. We recommend that MR studies explore possible IV-non-exposure associations across a much wider range of traits than is usually the case. Where associations are found, confounding by population stratification should be assessed through adjusting for relevant population structure variables. To distinguish vertical from horizontal pleiotropy we suggest using bidirectional MR between the exposure and non-exposure traits and MR of the effect of the non-exposure traits on the outcome of interest. If vertical pleiotropy is plausible, standard MR methods should be unbiased. If horizontal pleiotropy is plausible, we recommend using multivariable MR to control for observed pleiotropic traits and conducting sensitivity analyses which do not require prior knowledge of specific invalid IVs or pleiotropic paths.
Results: We applied our recommendations to an illustrative example of the effect of maternal insomnia on offspring birthweight in the UK Biobank. We found little evidence that unexpected IV-non-exposure associations were driven by population stratification. Three out of six observed non-exposure traits plausibly reflected horizontal pleiotropy. Multivariable MR and sensitivity analyses suggested an inverse association of insomnia with birthweight, but effects were imprecisely estimated in some of these analyses.        
Conclusions: We provide guidance for MR studies where genetic IVs associate with non-exposure traits.","/content/10.1101/19009605v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009605v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Epidemiology

"Trade Study of Population Age Groups for a Clinical Trial in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder","ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity that is treated by an array of different modalities in order to decrease functional impairment. Despite the variety of available pharmacologic treatment options and their widespread use, there still remains a strong need to create innovative therapies. Game Based Therapy (GBT) is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy that seeks to increase the efficacy of currently available pharmacological treatments through improving cognitive deficits and reducing the current dose of such treatments. At the University of Kentucky, a clinical trial was implemented to assess the effects of combining stimulant pharmacotherapy with the popular video game Minecraft as Game Based Therapy on ADHD symptoms in children ages 10-15. However, the low subject recruitment played a large role in the trial failing to produce conclusive data from that site. 
This trade study serves to address the difficulties of subject recruitment and determine an optimal population and location for future adoption of the clinical trial. Through statistical analysis of state, national, and survey data it was found that in Lexington, Kentucky, 18-21 year olds are the optimal population for future GBT with pharmacotherapy clinical trials.","/content/10.1101/19009639v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009639v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Pharmacology and Therapeutics

"Genetic profile and functional proteomics of anal squamous cell carcinoma: proposal for a molecular classification","Background: Anal squamous cell carcinoma is a rare tumor. Chemo-radiotherapy yields a 50% 3-year relapse-free survival rate in advanced anal cancer, so improved predictive markers and therapeutic options are needed. 
Methods: High-throughput proteomics and whole-exome sequencing were performed in 46 paraffin samples from anal squamous cell carcinoma patients. Hierarchical clustering was used to establish groups de novo. Then, probabilistic graphical models were used to study the differences between groups of patients at the biological process level. 
Results: A molecular classification into two groups of patients was established, one group with increased expression of proteins related to adhesion, T lymphocytes and glycolysis; and the other group with increased expression of proteins related to translation and ribosomes. The probabilistic graphical model showed that these two groups presented differences in metabolism, mitochondria, translation, splicing and adhesion processes. Additionally, these groups showed different frequencies of genetic variants in some genes, such as ATM, SLFN11 and DST. Finally, genetic and proteomic characteristics of these groups suggested the use of some possible targeted therapies, such as PARP inhibitors or immunotherapy.
Conclusions: In this study, a molecular classification of anal squamous cell carcinoma using high-throughput proteomics and whole-exome sequencing data was proposed. Moreover, differences between the two established groups suggested some possible therapies.","/content/10.1101/19009522v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009522v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Oncology

"Simulation models of dengue transmission in Funchal, Madeira Island: influence of seasonality","The recent emergence and established presence of Aedes aegypti in the Autonomous region of Madeira, Portugal, was responsible for the first autochthonous outbreak of dengue in Europe. The island has not reported any dengue cases since the outbreak in 2012. However, there is a high risk that an introduction of the virus would result in another autochthonous outbreak given the presence of the vector and permissive environmental conditions. Understanding the dynamics of a potential epidemic is critical for targeted local control strategies. 

Here, we adapt a deterministic model for the transmission of dengue in A. aegypti mosquitoes. The model integrates empirical and mechanistic parameters for virus transmission, under seasonally varying temperatures for Funchal, Madeira Island. We examine the epidemic dynamics as triggered by the arrival date of an infectious individual; the influence of seasonal temperature mean and variation on the epidemic dynamics; and performed a sensitivity analysis on the following quantities of interest: the epidemic peak size, time to peak and the final epidemic size.

Our results demonstrate the potential for year-round transmission of dengue, with the arrival date significantly affecting the distribution of the timing and peak size of the epidemic. Late summer to early autumn arrivals is more likely to produce larger epidemics within a short peak time. Epidemics within this favorable period had an average of 22% of the susceptible population infected at the peak, at an average peak time of 82 days. We also demonstrated that seasonal temperature variation dramatically affects the epidemic dynamics, with warmer starting temperatures producing peaks more quickly after introduction and larger epidemics. Overall our quantities of interest were most sensitive to variance in date of arrival, seasonal temperature, biting rate, transmission rates, and the mosquito population; the magnitude of sensitivity differs across quantities. 

Our model could serve as a useful guide in the development of effective local control and mitigation strategies for dengue fever in Madeira Island.","/content/10.1101/19009555v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009555v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Hepatitis B virus resistance to tenofovir: fact or fiction? A synthesis of the evidence to date","Background: Tenofovir (TFV) is a widely used antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, therapy is not curative and long-term administration is therefore required in most cases, with a risk of selecting resistance-associated mutations (RAMs). There is a high genetic barrier to the selection of TFV resistance, but the distribution and clinical significance of TFV RAMs are not well understood, and the topic remains contentious. We here present assimilated evidence for TFV RAMs with the aim of cataloguing and characterising mutations that are likely to be of most clinical significance, and starting to develop relevant mechanistic insights.
Methods: We carried out a systematic literature search in PubMed to identify clinical, in vitro and in silico evidence of TFV resistance. The structure of HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) has not been solved; we therefore compared HBV RT to the crystal structure for HIV RT in order to map the likely sites of RAMs.
Results: We identified 37 putative TFV RAMs in HBV RT, occurring within and outside sites of enzyme activity, which we have mapped onto a homologous HIV RT crystal structure. Most resistance arises as a result of suites of multiple RAMs. Other factors including adherence, HBV DNA viral load, HBeAg status, HIV coinfection and NA dosage may also influence viraemic suppression. 
Conclusion: There is emerging evidence for polymorphisms that reduce susceptibility to TVF. If clinically significant TFV resistance increases in prevalence, there will be a pressing need for the development of new agents. A better understanding of HBV drug resistance is imperative to ensure that these do not impact on the international elimination targets that are to be met by 2030.

"A Markov Chain approach for ranking treatments in network meta-analysis","When interpreting the relative effects from a network meta-analysis (NMA), researchers are usually aware of the potential limitations that may render the results for some comparisons less useful or meaningless. In the presence of sufficient and appropriate data, some of these limitations (e.g. risk of bias, small-study effects, publication bias) can be taken into account in the statistical analysis. Very often, though, the necessary data for applying these methods are missing and data limitations cannot be formally integrated into ranking. In addition, there are other important characteristics of the treatment comparisons that cannot be addressed within a statistical model but only through qualitative judgements; for example, the relevance of data to the research question, the plausibility of the assumptions, etc. Here, we propose a new measure for treatment ranking called the Probability of Selecting a Treatment to Recommend (POST-R). We suggest that the order of treatments should represent the process of considering treatments for selection in clinical practice and we assign to each treatment a probability of being selected. This process can be considered as a Markov chain model that allows the end-users of NMA to select the most appropriate treatments based not only on the NMA results but also to information external to the NMA. In this way, we obtain rankings that can inform decision-making more efficiently as they represent not only the relative effects but also their potential limitations. We illustrate our approach using a NMA comparing treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis and we provide the Stata commands.","/content/10.1101/19008722v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008722v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Epidemiology

"Dengue importation into Europe: a network connectivity-based approach","The spread of dengue through global human mobility is a major public health concern. A key challenge is understanding the transmission pathways and mediating factors that characterized the patterns of dengue importation into non-endemic areas. Utilizing a network connectivity-based approach, we analyze the importation patterns of dengue fever into European countries. 
Seven connectivity indices were developed to characterize the role of the air passenger traffic, seasonality, incidence rate, geographical proximity, epidemic vulnerability, and wealth of a source country, in facilitating the transport and importation of dengue fever. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the relationship between dengue importation and the connectivity indices while accounting for the air transport network structure. We also incorporated network autocorrelation within a GLMM framework to investigate the propensity of a European country to receive an imported case, by virtue of its position within the air transport network. 
The connectivity indices and dynamical processes of the air transport network were strong predictors of dengue importation in Europe. With more than 70% of the variation in dengue importation patterns explained. We found that transportation potential was higher for source countries with seasonal dengue activity, high passenger traffic, high incidence rates, lower economic status, and geographical proximity to a destination country in Europe. We also found that position of a European country within the air transport network was a strong predictor of the country' propensity to receive an imported case.
Our findings provide evidence that the importation patterns of dengue into Europe can be largely explained by appropriately characterizing the heterogeneities of the source, and topology of the air transport network. This contributes to the foundational framework for building integrated predictive models for bio-surveillance of dengue importation.","/content/10.1101/19009589v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009589v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Public and Global Health

"A Network Analysis Framework to Improve the Delivery of Mosquito Abatement Services in Machala, Ecuador","Background: Vector-borne disease places a high health and economic burden in the American tropics. Comprehensive vector control programs remain the primary method of containing local outbreaks. With limited resources, many vector control operations struggle to serve all affected communities within their districts. In the coastal city of Machala, Ecuador, vector control services, such as application of larvicides and truck-mounted fogging, are delivered through two deployment facilities managed by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health. Public health professionals in Machala face several logistical issues when delivering mosquito abatement services, namely applying limited resources in ways that will most effectively suppress vectors of malaria, dengue, and encephalitis viruses. 

Methods: Using a transportation network analysis framework, we built models of service areas and optimized delivery routes based on distance costs associated with accessing neighborhoods throughout the city. Optimized routes were used to estimate the relative cost of accessing neighborhoods for mosquito control services in Machala, creating a visual tool to guide decision makers and maximize mosquito control program efficiency. Location-allocation analyses were performed to evaluate efficiency gains of moving service deployment to other available locations with respect to distance to service hub, neighborhood population, dengue incidence, and housing condition.

Results: Using this framework, we identified different locations for targeting mosquito control efforts, dependent upon management goals and specified risk factors of interest, including human population, housing condition, and reported dengue incidence. Our models indicate that neighborhoods on the periphery of Machala with the poorest housing conditions are the most costly to access. Optimal locations of facilities for deployment of control services change depending on pre-determined management priorities, increasing the population served via inexpensive routes up to 34.9%, and reducing overall cost of accessing neighborhoods up to 12.7%. 

Conclusions: Our transportation network models indicate that current locations of mosquito control facilities in Machala are not ideal for minimizing driving distances or maximizing populations served. Services may be optimized by moving vector control operations to other existing public health facilities in Machala. This work represents a first step in creating a spatial tool for planning and critically evaluating the systematic delivery of mosquito control services in Machala and elsewhere.","/content/10.1101/19009498v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009498v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Phase I assessments of first-in-human administration of a novel malaria anti-sporozoite vaccine candidate, R21 in matrix-M adjuvant, in UK and Burkinabe volunteers","Background Improvements in malaria control have stalled recently and new tools are needed. The R21 vaccine is comprised of the malaria circumsporozoite protein fused to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It forms particles that lack the excess HBsAg in the frequently tested malaria vaccine candidate, RTS,S/AS01B.
Methods We conducted an open-label, first-in-human, Phase Ia study evaluating safety and immunogenicity of R21 administered alone and with the saponin-based adjuvant, Matrix-MTM (MM). Twenty-eight healthy adults received three doses of R21 given intramuscularly 4 weeks apart. We subsequently conducted a Phase Ib randomised, controlled trial in West African adults.
Findings Vaccinations were well tolerated, and the majority of local and systemic adverse events were mild. Reactogenicity was significantly lower in Burkinabe than UK vaccinees (p<0.0001). Antibody responses increased significantly 28 days after the 2nd vaccination in UK volunteers. Antibody responses to R21 in all dose groups (2Âµg, 10Âµg and 50Âµg) were comparable to those of 50Âµg RTS,S/AS01B in malaria-naÃ¯ve adults at 28 days after final vaccination. The 10Âµg dose induced more durable responses, with 2-fold higher NANP-specific IgG titres at 6 months compared with the 2Âµg and 50Âµg dose groups. R21 also boosted baseline humoral responses in Burkinabe adults with well-maintained responses suggesting natural boosting.
Interpretation R21 adjuvanted with MM is safe and has comparable immunogenicity to RTS,S/AS01B, even when administered at a five-fold lower 10Âµg dose in UK and African populations. This forms the basis for efficacy testing of this vaccine which could prove to be particularly cost-effective to manufacture and deploy.","/content/10.1101/19009282v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009282v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Improving parents knowledge of early signs of pediatric eye disease: A double-blind RCT","Background and Objectives: Early diagnosis and intervention is essential to achieve optimal outcomes for most pediatric eye diseases. Educating parents/caregivers to recognize early signs of disease and consult a healthcare professional is critical to achieving this aim. We evaluate the effectiveness of an eye-health information pamphlet on parents level of concern and their help-seeking intention if they observed leukocoria or strabismus. 

Methods: Pregnant women attending a metropolitan antenatal clinic were recruited to the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a pamphlet on either pediatric eye health (intervention) or strategies for play (control). The primary outcome measure was a change in the parents level of concern if they observed leukocoria or strabismus. The secondary outcome measure was a change in their help-seeking intention if either sign was observed. 

Results: Of the 518 women enrolled, 382 (73.7%) completed the post-test survey. At follow-up, women who received the intervention were more likely to report a higher level of concern if they observed leukocoria (OR 1.711 [CI: 1.176-2.497] p=0.005]) and were less likely to have a delayed help-seeking intention. (OR 0.560 [CI 0.382-0.817] p =0.003) No change in the level of concern for strabismus was identified between the groups; however, at follow-up, women who received the intervention were less likely to delay help-seeking (OR 0.318 [CI 0.125-0.806] p=0.016).

Conclusion: Providing parents with relevant, evidence-based information can significantly improve their knowledge and positively influence help-seeking intentions if leukocoria or strabismus are observed.

"Female genital schistosomiasis and reproductive tract infections. A cross-sectional study in rural adolescents in South Africa","Background and objectives: 
The aim of the current study was to establish the relative prevalences of Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We hypothesised that due to the use of syndromic management for STIs it is possible that FGS is being misdiagnosed and mismanaged as an STI. We therefore wanted to examine the relationship between FGS and the individual STIs in schistosomiasis endemic areas. 
Methods:
Between 2011 and 2013, a cross-sectional study was performed in 32 randomly selected secondary schools in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where each school had at least 300 pupils. In a research clinic, FGS diagnosis, STI testing, and face-to-face interviews were performed in sexually active, young women aged 16 - 22 years.
Results: 
FGS was the second most prevalent current genital infection (23%). There were significantly more women who had presented FGS among those who had detectable urinary schistosomiasis (35%), compared to those without (19%, p< 0.001). In the FGS positive group 35% were positive for HPV infection, compared to  24 % in the FGS negative group (p=0.010). In the FGS positive group 37% were sero-positive for HSV infection, compared to 30% in the FGS negative group (p=0.079). There were significantly fewer chlamydia infections amongst women with FGS (20%, p=0.018) compared with those who did not have FGS (28%). 
Conclusions:
FGS was the second most common genital infection after HSV but the two were not significantly associated. HPV infection was significantly associated with FGS. Surprisingly Chlamydia infection were negatively associated with FGS. The results show the importance of the inclusion of FGS in the management protocols for genital infections in areas endemic for urinary schistosomiasis, and highlight the importance for more research on suitable differential diagnostic tools and disease management.","/content/10.1101/19009233v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009233v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Sexual and Reproductive Health

Methods: ACHD outpatients (n=101; age 42Â±14 y; 52% female; 85% white; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 56Â±9%) were enrolled in a prospective study. Supine and standing 12-lead ECG was recorded simultaneously with a right- and left-sided S-ICD 3-lead ECG. Peak-to-peak QRS and T amplitudes, RR, PR, QT, QTc, QRS intervals, Tmax, and R/Tmax (31 predictor variables) were tested. Model selection, training, and testing were performed using supine ECG datasets. Validation was performed using standing ECG datasets and out-of-sample non-ACHD population (n=68; age 54Â±16 y; 54% female; 94% white; LVEF 61Â±8%). 
Results: A 40% of participants were ineligible for S-ICD. Tetralogy of Fallot patients passed right-sided screening (57%) more often than left-sided (21%; McNemar's <U+03C7>2 P=0.025). The ridge model demonstrated the best cross-validation function. Validation of the ridge models was satisfactory for standing left-sided [ROC AUC 0.687 (95%CI 0.582-0.791)] and right-sided [ROC AUC 0.655(95%CI 0.549-0.762)] SICD eligibility prediction. Out-of-sample validation in the non-ACHD population yielded a 100% sensitivity of the pre-selected threshold for the elastic net model. Validation of the transformation matrices showed satisfactory agreement (<0.1 mV difference). 
Conclusion: Nearly half of the contemporary ACHD population is ineligible for S-ICD. Machine-learning prediction of SICD eligibility can be used for screening of SICD candidates.

"Investigation of an estimate of daily resting heart rate using a consumer wearable device","Resting heart rate is accepted as a valid overall indicator of cardiovascular risk and is a low-cost easy-to-measure metric that can be collected in both home and clinical settings. Wearable devices such as smartwatches and trackers can measure heart rate continuously using optical technology. This study reports initially on the agreement between the resting heart rate reported by a wearable device (Fitbit Charge HR and Fitbit Blaze) and a chest-based consumer electrocardiogram (Polar H7).  In 45 subjects, the reported resting heart rates agreed within 0.89 bpm over a resting period of 5 mins. The same device and algorithm was then used in a population of 168 subjects (45.9 Â± 15.6 yrs) who were asked to collect their resting heart rate for four days under seven different conditions and times (at wake sitting/lying down, pre-breakfast, pre-lunch, pre-dinner, and before bed sitting/lying down). The reported values were compared with the Daily Resting Heart Rate (DRHR) reported by the wearable device. The measurement  lying down before wake were closest to the DRHR (mean error of 0.0 bpm with a 25-75th percentile spread of Â±3.5bpm. There was a significant circadian variation in the reported resting heart rate across subjects, with the highest values reported in the  middle of the day. Within individual subjects, the median standard deviation of heart rate at rest was 3-5bpm even measured under nominally similar conditions over four days.","/content/10.1101/19008771v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008771v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Cardiovascular Medicine

"The prevalence and risk factors for phantom limb pain in people with amputations: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Background and objective
Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a common complication in people with limb amputations. There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the prevalence of PLP in people with limb amputations. Therefore, this review aimed to determine the estimated pooled prevalence of PLP, and risk factors associated with this complication.
Methods
Articles published between 1980 and July 2019 were identified through a systematic search of the following electronic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Africa-Wide Information, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Academic Search Premier. Grey literature was searched on databases for preprints. Two reviewers independently performed the screening of articles, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. The meta-analyses were conducted using the random-effects model. A statistically significant level for the analyses was set at p>0.05. 
Results
The pooling of all studies demonstrated a prevalence estimate of 63% [95% CI: 58.23-67.05] with high heterogeneity [I2=95.70% (95% CI: 95.10-96.20)]. The prevalence of PLP was significantly lower in developing countries compared to developed countries [53.98% vs 64.55%; p=0.04]. Persistent pre-operative pain, proximal site of amputation, lower limb amputation, stump pain and phantom sensations were identified as risk factors for PLP. 
Conclusion
This systematic review and meta-analysis estimates that six of every 10 people with an amputation report PLP - a high and important prevalence of PLP. Health care professionals ought to be aware of the high rates of PLP and implement strategies to reduce PLP by addressing known risk factors, specifically those identified by the current study.","/content/10.1101/19008961v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008961v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Bringing Proportional Recovery into Proportion: Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling of Post-Stroke Motor Performance","Accurate predictions of motor performance after stroke are of cardinal importance for the patient, clinician, and health care system. More than ten years ago, the proportional recovery rule was introduced by promising just that: high-fidelity predictions of recovery following stroke based only on the initially lost motor performance, at least for a specific fraction of patients. However, emerging evidence suggests that this recovery rule is subject to various confounds and may apply less universally than assumed by many.
We systematically revisited stroke outcome predictions by casting the data in a less confounded form and employing more integrative and flexible hierarchical Bayesian models. We jointly analyzed n=385 post-stroke trajectories from six separate studies - the currently largest overall dataset of upper limb motor recovery. We addressed confounding ceiling effects by introducing a subset approach and ensured correct model estimation through synthetic data simulations. Finally, we used model comparisons to assess the underlying nature of recovery within our empirical recovery data.
The first model comparison, relying on the conventional fraction of patients called fitters, pointed to a combination of constant and proportional to lost function recovery. Proportional to lost here describes the original notion of proportionality, indicating greater recovery in case of a more pronounced initial deficit. This combination explained only 32% of the variance in recovery, which is in stark contrast to previous reports of >80%. When instead analyzing the complete spectrum of subjects, model comparison selected a composite of constant and proportional to spared function recovery, implying a more significant improvement in case of more preserved function. Explained variance was at 53%.
Therefore, our data suggest that motor recovery post-stroke may exhibit some characteristics of proportionality. However, the levels of explanatory value were substantially reduced compared to what has previously been reported. This finding motivates future research moving beyond solely behavior scores to explain stroke recovery and establish robust single-subject predictions.","/content/10.1101/19009159v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009159v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Neurology

"Mosquito exposure and malaria morbidity; a micro-level analysis of household mosquito populations and malaria in a population-based longitudinal cohort in western Kenya","Background: Malaria morbidity is highly overdispersed in the population. Fine-scale differences in mosquito exposure may partially explain this heterogeneity. However, exposure variability has not been related to individual malaria outcomes.
Methods: We established a cohort of 38 households to explore the effect of household-level mosquito exposure and individual insecticide treated net(ITN) use on relative risk(RR) of diagnostically-confirmed malaria. We conducted monthly active surveillance (n=254; 2,624 person-months) and weekly mosquito collection in all households (2,092 household-days of collection). We used molecular techniques to confirm human blood feeding and exposure to infectious mosquitoes.
Results: Of 1,494 female anopheles (89.8% Anopheles gambiae s.l.). 88.3% were fed, 51.9% had a human bloodmeal, and 9.2% were sporozoite-infected. 168 laboratory-confirmed malaria episodes were reported (incidence rate 0.064 episodes per person-month at risk, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.055,0.074). Malaria risk was directly associated with exposure to sporozoite-infected mosquitoes (RR=1.24, 95%CI:1.11,1.38). No direct effect was measured between ITN use and malaria morbidity, however, ITN use did moderate the effect of mosquito exposure on morbidity. 
Conclusions: Malaria risk increases linearly with vector density and feeding success for persons with low ITN use. In contrast, malaria risk among high ITN users is consistently low and insensitive to variation in mosquito exposure.","/content/10.1101/19008854v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008854v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Epidemiology

"Implications of MGMT promoter methylation and its downstream hMSH2 mRNA in primary malignant glioma","Background: Hypermethylation of 06-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter seen in high grade gliomas (HGG) leads to the accumulation of O6-meG DNA damage which mispairs with thymine, requiring recognition by mismatch repair protein dimer MutSa, whose primary component is coded by Human MutS homolog protein 2 (hMSH2). O6-meG repair necessitates the interaction/combined action of MGMT and hMSH2 to maintain genomic stability. Analysis of the correlation between MGMT methylation and hMSH2 mRNA expression in HGG and their role in the prognosis was explored. 
Methods: Study was performed on 54 primary-frontal lobe HGG tumors, MGMT promoter methylation was detected by Q-MSP and Q-PCR was used to analyze hMSH2 m-RNA expression levels. 
Results: MGMT methylation was seen in 62% patients the mean percentage of methylation (PoM) being (17.62Â±17.20) %.  MGMT PoM =10% had improved Progression free survival (p=0.015) and =8% had better Overall survival (p=0.043), indicating its predictive significance. Over expression of hMSH2 was seen in 50% patients with a median fold change of 2.74 (p=0.021). Univariate analysis of high hMSH2 expression with therapy (CT+RT) showed poor PFS (p=0.002). There was no correlation between MGMT methylation and hMSH2 expression. 
Conclusion: MGMT PoM of =10% is a significant prognostic marker. Over expression of hMSH2 is prognostic marker for poor treatment response. Lack of/aberrant correlation between MGMT and hMSH2 could indicate impaired DNA repair of O6-meG in HGG, and this could be one of the factors responsible for both, gliomagenesis and variations in treatment response.","/content/10.1101/19008763v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008763v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Oncology

"The importance of adolescent girls and ""epidemic gearing"" on HIV prevalence across West Africa","Background:
In West Africa HIV prevalence varies between 0.1-6% in female and between 0.1-4% in the male general population. Male circumcision is almost universal, and it is unclear what drives this variation. We use mathematical modelling to identify the determinants of this variation across fourteen West African countries. 
Methods:
We developed a novel dynamic model of HIV transmission between population cohorts of  female sex workers (FSWs), their clients, females with 2+ partners in the past year and other sexually active women and men in the general population. Parameter ranges were determined from the literature and sampled using Latin Hypercube sampling to identify parameter sets that fit West African HIV prevalence data. Partial-rank correlation coefficients between different model parameters and the HIV prevalence in general male and female population across 14 countries were calculated to determine to most significantly correlated model parameters to HIV prevalence.  
Results:
The key determinant of HIV in females when prevalence is between 0-3% is the size of the brothel and non-brothel FSW groups. When female HIV prevalence >3%, the percentage of sexually active adolescent females with 2+ partners has greater influence on HIV prevalence. The size of the FSW groups has the most significant impact on HIV prevalence for males. 
Conclusions:
Our findings  confirm the role of FSWs in West Africa as an important determinant of HIV risk, but also identify, in countries with higher HIV prevalence, the emerging role of a group of adolescent girls with 2+ partners is an important determinant of risk. In fact, our findings suggest that this group may enable the epidemic to be effectively ""geared up"" when partnerships are formed with higher-risk males, indicating additional prevention needs amongst this group.

"Trends and variation in prescribing of suboptimal statin treatment regimes: a cohort study in English primary care","Objectives: We set out to describe trends and variation in statin prescribing in England that breaches 2014 national guidance on ""high-intensity"" statins. We identify factors associated with breaching; and assess the feasibility of rapid prescribing behaviour change.
Design, Setting and Participants: Retrospective cohort study in NHS primary care in England, including all 8,142 standard general practices from August 2010 to March 2019.
Main Outcome Measures: We categorised statins as high or low/medium-intensity based on two different thresholds, and calculated the proportion prescribed below these thresholds across all practices. We plotted trends and geographical variation, carried out mixed effects logistic regression to identify practice characteristics associated with breaching guidance, and used indicator saturation to identify practices exhibiting sudden changes in prescribing. 
Results: We included all 8,142 practices across the study period. The proportion of statin prescriptions below the recommended 40% LDL-lowering threshold decreased gradually since 2012 from 80% to 45%; the proportion below a pragmatic 37% threshold decreased from 30% to 18%. The 2014 guidance had minimal impact on these trends. We found wide variation between practices (interdecile ranges 20% to 85% and 10% to 30% respectively in 2018). Mixed effects logistic regression did not identify practice characteristics strongly associated with breaching guidance. Indicator saturation identified several practices exhibiting sudden changes in prescribing towards greater guideline compliance. 
Conclusions: Breaches of English guidance on choice of statin remain common, with substantial variation between GP practices. Some practices and regions have implemented rapid change, indicating the feasibility of rapid prescribing behaviour change. We discuss the potential for a national strategic approach, using data and evidence to optimise care, including targeted education alongside audit and feedback to outliers through services such as OpenPrescribing.","/content/10.1101/19008748v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008748v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Patient Preferences to Undergo Low-Value CT Coronary Angiography in the Emergency Department","Background:
Low-value diagnostic testing adds billions of dollars to the cost of health care in the US annually. Addressing patient preference for these tests is one possible strategy to limit overuse. In previous work, we showed that patient preference for testing can be influenced by test benefit, risk, and financial measures. Our objective was to examine the effect of these variables in another clinical scenario involving chest pain.

Methods:
In this cross-sectional survey of patients at the University of Michigan Emergency Department (ED), participants were given a hypothetical scenario involving an ED visit for chest pain, along with information regarding potential benefit (detecting a life-threatening condition; 0.1 or 1%) and risk (developing cancer; 0.1 or 1%) of CTCA, as well as an incentive of $0 or $100 to forego testing. Values for risk, benefit, and financial incentive varied across participants. Our primary outcome was patient preference to undergo testing. We also obtained demographic and numeracy information. Then, we used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios, adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Our sample size was designed to find at least 300 events (test acceptance) to allow for up to 30 covariates in fully adjusted models. We had 85-90% power to detect a 10% absolute difference in testing rate across groups, assuming a 95% significance level.

Results:
913 patients were surveyed. A $100 financial incentive (adjusted OR [AOR] 0.57; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.42-0.78) and increased test risk (AOR 0.61; 95% CI 0.44-0.84) both significantly decreased test acceptance in fully adjusted models, whereas increased test benefit significantly increased test acceptance (AOR 2.45; 95% CI 1.79-3.36).

Conclusions:
Offering a financial incentive deterred patients from accepting testing despite varying levels of risk and benefit. In the context of previous work, we provide preliminary evidence supporting that financial interventions may impact patient preference more than test risk and benefit.","/content/10.1101/19008391v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008391v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Emergency Medicine

"Targeting the centromedian thalamic nucleus for deep brain stimulation","Objectives: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM) is an emerging treatment for multiple brain diseases, including the drug-resistant epilepsy Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). We aimed to improve neurosurgical targeting of the CM by (i) developing a structural MRI approach for CM visualisation, (ii) identifying the CM's neurophysiological characteristics, and (iii) mapping connectivity from CM-DBS sites using functional MRI (fMRI).

Methods: Nineteen patients with LGS (mean age=28 years) underwent pre-surgical 3 tesla MRI using magnetisation-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) and fMRI sequences; 16 proceeded to bilateral CM-DBS implantation and intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MERs) from the thalamus. CM visualisation was achieved by highlighting intrathalamic borders on MP2RAGE using Sobel edge-detection. Mixed-effects analysis compared two MER features (spike firing rate, background noise) between ventrolateral, CM, and parafasicular nuclei. Resting-state fMRI connectivity was assessed using implanted CM-DBS electrode positions as regions-of-interest.
 
Results: The CM appeared as a hyperintense region bordering the comparatively hypointense pulvinar, mediodorsal, and parafasicular nuclei. At the group-level, reduced spike firing and background noise distinguished CM from the ventrolateral nucleus; however, these trends were not found in 20-25% of individual MER trajectories. Areas of fMRI connectivity included basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebellum, sensorimotor/premotor and limbic cortex.  

Conclusions: In the largest clinical trial cohort of LGS patients undergoing CM-DBS reported to date, we show that accurate targeting of the CM is achievable using 3 tesla MP2RAGE MRI. MERs may provide additional localising features in some cases, however their utility is limited by inter-patient variability. Therapeutic effects of CM-DBS may be mediated via connectivity with brain networks that support diverse arousal, cognitive, and sensorimotor processes.","/content/10.1101/19008136v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008136v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Neurology

"Sugar or Salt (SOS): a protocol for a UK multicentre randomised trial of mannitol and hypertonic saline in severe traumatic brain injury and intracranial hypertension","Hyperosmolar solutions are widely used to treat raised intracranial pressure (ICP) following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although mannitol has historically been the most frequently administered, hypertonic saline (HTS) solutions are increasingly being used. However, definitive evidence regarding their comparative effectiveness is lacking. The Sugar or Salt (SOS) Trial is a UK randomised, allocation concealed open label multicentre pragmatic trial designed to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of hypertonic saline (HTS) compared with mannitol in the management of patients with severe TBI. Patients requiring intensive care unit admission and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring post-TBI will be allocated at random to receive equi-osmolar boluses of either mannitol or HTS following failure of routine first line measures to control ICP. The primary outcome for the study will be the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) assessed at 6 months after randomisation. Results will inform current clinical practice in the routine use of hyperosmolar therapy as well as assess the impact of potential side effects. Pre-planned longer term clinical and cost effectiveness analyses will further inform the use of these treatments.","/content/10.1101/19008276v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008276v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine

"Reorganization of nurse scheduling reduces the risk of healthcare associated infections","Background. Efficient prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HAIs) is still an open problem.

Objective. To design efficient hospital infection control strategies by reorganizing nurse scheduling.

Design, setting, and participants. Proof-of-concept modeling study based on high-resolution contact data from wearable sensors between patients, nurses, doctors, and administrative staff at a short-stay geriatric ward of a University hospital.

Methods. We considered isolation and contact removal to identify the most important class of individuals for HAI dissemination. We introduced a novel intervention based on the reorganization of nurse scheduling. This strategy switches and reassigns nurses' tasks through the optimization of shift timelines, while respecting feasibility constraints and satisfying patient-care requirements. We evaluated the impact of interventions through a Susceptible-Colonized-Susceptible transmission model on the empirical and reorganized contacts. 

Results. Isolation and contact removal produced the largest risk reduction when acting on nurses. Reorganizing their schedules reduced HAI risk by 27% (95% confidence interval [24,29]%) while preserving the timeliness, number, and duration of contacts. More than 30% nurse-nurse contacts should be avoided to achieve an equivalent reduction through simple contact removal. No overall change in the number of nurses per patient resulted from the intervention. 

Conclusions. Reorganization of nurse scheduling offers an alternative change of practice that substantially limits HAI risk in the ward while ensuring the timeliness and quality of healthcare services. This calls for including optimization of nurse scheduling practices in programs for better infection control in hospitals.","/content/10.1101/19007724v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007724v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Epidemiology

"Plasma proteomics reveals markers of metabolic stress in HIV infected children with severe acute malnutrition: call for more evidence-based nutritional intervention strategies","HIV infection affects up to 30% of children presenting with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Africa and is associated with increased mortality. Children with SAM are treated similarly regardless of the presence of HIV although mechanisms of nutritional recovery in HIV and/or SAM are not well understood. We aimed to test the hypothesis that metabolic and inflammatory perturbations among children with SAM differed between those with HIV (n = 54) and without HIV (n = 113) to better understand their specific nutritional and therapeutic requirements. We performed a secondary analysis of a clinical trial and plasma proteomics data among children with complicated SAM in Kenya and Malawi. Compared to children with SAM without HIV, HIV-infected children had evidence (false discovery rate corrected p<0.05) of metabolic stress, including enriched pathways related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. Moreover, we observed reduced plasma levels of zinc-a-2-glycoprotrein, butyrylcholinesterase, and increased levels of complement C2 resembling findings in metabolic syndrome, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. HIV was also associated (false discovery rate corrected p<0.05) with higher levels of plasma chemokines: MCP1, CCL4, GCSF, IL1b, TNFa, IL-2, 5, 7, 8 and 15, IL12p40, IP-10, and IL-1RA. Considering evidence of biomarkers of metabolic stress in children with HIV and SAM, it is of potential concern that our current treatment strategy for SAM regardless of HIV status involves a high-fat therapeutic diet. The results of this study indicate a need for clinical trials of therapeutic foods that meet the specific metabolic needs of children with HIV and SAM.","/content/10.1101/19006726v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006726v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18",NA,"Gonzales","/highwire/citation/69547/bibtext",234,"211119-234","21/11/2019","69547"
"Community gender systems and daughter's risk of female genital mutilation/cutting: New theory and application to Egypt","We proposed and tested a feminist social ecological theory about daughters' experience of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGMC) in Egypt, where over 90% of women ages 15 to 49 are cut. FGMC has potential adverse effects on demographic and health outcomes and has been defined as a human rights violation. Contextual factors are important determinants of FGMC, but an integrated theory is lacking, and quantitative multilevel research is limited. We theorized that more favorable community level gender systems, including gender norms opposing FGMC and expanded opportunities for women outside of the family, would be associated with a daughter's lower risk of FGMC and would strengthen the negative association of a mother's opposition to FGMC with her daughter's risk of cutting. Using a national sample of 14,171 mother/daughter dyads from the 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey, we estimated multilevel discrete time hazard models to test these relationships. Community gender norms opposing FGMC had significant direct, negative associations with the hazard that a daughter was cut, but women's opportunities outside the family did not. Maternal opposition to FGMC was negatively associated with cutting a daughter, and these associations were stronger where community opposition to FGMC and opportunities for women were greater. Results provided good support for a gender systems theory of the multilevel influences on FGMC. Integrated, multilevel interventions that address gender norms about FGMC and opportunities for women in the community, as well as beliefs about the practice among the mothers of at-risk daughters may be needed for sustainable declines in the practice.","/content/10.1101/19005520v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005520v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Public and Global Health

"BRAF mutation testing of MSI CRCs in Lynch syndrome diagnostics: performance and efficiency according to patient`s age","Background and aims:
BRAF V600E mutations have been reported to be associated with sporadic microsatellite-unstable (MSI) colorectal cancer (CRC), while rarely detected in CRCs of Lynch syndrome (LS) patients. Therefore, current international diagnostic guidelines recommend somatic BRAF mutation testing in MLH1-deficient MSI CRC patients to exclude LS. As sporadic BRAF-mutant MSI CRC is a disease of the elderly, while LS-associated CRC usually occurs at younger age, we hypothesized that the efficacy of BRAF testing in LS diagnostics may be age-dependent. 

Methods:	
We systematically compared the prevalence of BRAF V600E mutations in LS-associated CRCs and MSI CRCs from population-based cohorts in different age groups as available from published studies, databases, and population-based patient cohorts. Cost calculations and sensitivity analysis of the BRAF testing for exclusion of LS was performed. 

Results:
Among 969 MSI CRCs from LS mutation carriers from the literature and German HNPCC Consortium, 15 (1.6%, 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%) harbored BRAF mutations. 6/7 LS patients with BRAF-mutant CRC and reported age were <50 years. Among unselected MSI CRCs, 44.8% (339/756) harbored BRAF mutations, 92.3% (313/339) of which were detected in patients >60 years. In MSI CRC patients <50, BRAF mutations were detected only in 0.6% (2/339), and the inclusion of BRAF testing led to increased costs and higher risk of missing LS patients (1.2%) compared to other age groups. 

Conclusion:
BRAF testing in patients <50 years is cost-inefficient and carries the highest risk of missing LS patients among different age groups. We suggest direct referral of MSI CRC patients <50 years to genetic counseling without prior BRAF testing.","/content/10.1101/19009274v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009274v1.full.pdf","2019-10-16","Gastroenterology

"Association of polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease with subsequent events amongst established cases","Background: There is growing evidence that polygenic risk scores (PRS) can be used to identify individuals at high lifetime risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Whether they can also be used to stratify risk of subsequent events among those surviving a first CAD event remains uncertain.
Methods: Using two subsamples of UK Biobank, defined at baseline as prevalent CAD (N=10,287) and without CAD (N=393,108), we evaluated associations between a CAD PRS and incident cardiovascular and fatal outcomes, during a median follow up of 7.8 years.
Results: A 1 S.D. higher PRS was associated with increased risk of incident MI in participants without CAD (OR 1.33; 95% C.I. 1.29, 1.38), but the effect estimate was markedly attenuated in those with prevalent CAD (OR 1.15; 95% C.I. 1.06, 1.25); heterogeneity P =0.0012. Additionally, among prevalent CAD cases, we found evidence of an inverse association between the CAD PRS and risk of all-cause death (OR 0.91; 95% C.I. 0.85, 0.98) compared to those without CAD (OR 1.01; 95% C.I. 0.99, 1.03); heterogeneity P =0.0041. A similar inverse association was found for ischaemic stroke (Prevalent CAD (OR 0.78; 95% C.I. 0.67, 0.90); without CAD (OR 1.09; 95% C.I. 1.04, 1.15), heterogeneity P < 0.001). 
Conclusions: Bias induced by case stratification and survival into UK Biobank may attenuate, or reverse, associations of polygenic risk scores derived from case-control studies or populations initially free of disease. Polygenic risk scores for subsequent events should be derived from new genome wide association studies conducted in patients with established disease.","/content/10.1101/19009431v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009431v1.full.pdf","2019-10-16","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Efficacy and safety of Nab-paclitaxel in breast cancer: a meta-analysis","Worldwide breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in women. Paclitaxel is an effective drug used for the treatment of breast cancer but it has many side effects. Nab-paclitaxel (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel) is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of breast cancer. Currently many clinical trials are conducted to deliver nab-paclitaxel into the tumor cells. But the efficacy and safety of this nab-paclitaxel over conventional paclitaxel still remains questionable. So, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel in breast cancer treatment. Electronic databases were searched for the suitable studies using key terms 'nab-paclitaxel', 'paclitaxel', and 'clinical trial' with the combination of 'breast cancer' up to August 11, 2019. Risk ratio (RR) and odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. All statistical analyses were performed by the Open Meta-Analyst program. A total of eight studies which fulfilled our criteria were included in this study. For efficacy we retrieved data of 12 months progression free survival, 24 months progression free survival, and overall survival (up to 3 years) and for the safety we took data of nausea, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhea and pain. We did not found any difference in efficacy of nab-paclitaxel over paclitaxel (12 months progression free survival- RRFE= 0.86, 95%CI= 0.77-0.97, p= 0.02, I2= 25.07%; 24 months progression free survival- RRFE= 0.86, 95% CI= 0.64-1.16, p= 0.34, I2= 0%; and 3 years survival- RRFE= 1.20, 95%CI= 0.92-1.56, p= 0.16, I2= 37.55%). The meta-analysis of studies used nab-paclitaxel showed reduced adverse effect of anemia (ORFE= 1.66, 95% CI= 1.26-2.19; p= <0.001; I2= 0%) and leukopenia (ORFE= 1.37; 95%CI= 1.06-1.75; p= 0.01; I2= 48.63%). However, in case of other adverse effects no significant association was found with nab-paclitaxel (nausea- ORFE=1.15, 95%CI= 0.94-1.41, p= 0.15, I2= 50.12%; neutropenia- ORRE= 0.75, 95%CI= 0.30-1.87, p= 0.54, I2= 94.45%; fatigue- ORRE= 1.11, 95%CI= 0.77-1.62, p= 0.55, I2= 56.02; diarrhea- ORFE= 1.11, 95%CI= 0.77-1.62, p= 0.55; I2= 34.26; pain- ORRE= 1.15, 95%CI= 0.78-1.69, p= 0.45, I2= 52.96%). In conclusion the use of nab-paclitaxel has reduces the side effects of anemia and leukopenia in breast cancer treatment in comparison to paclitaxel but nab-paclitaxel has no effect on the overall survival of the patients.","/content/10.1101/19008672v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008672v1.full.pdf","2019-10-16","Oncology

"NeuroMark: an adaptive independent component analysis framework for estimating reproducible and comparable fMRI biomarkers among brain disorders","Increasing data-sharing initiatives have provided unprecedented opportunities to study brain disorders. Standardized approaches for capturing reproducible and comparable biomarkers are greatly needed in big-data analysis. Here, we propose a framework (called NeuroMark) that leverages a priori-driven independent component analysis (ICA) to extract functional brain network features from fMRI data. NeuroMark estimates features adaptable to each individual and comparable across subjects by taking advantage of the replicated brain network templates extracted from 1828 healthy controls. Four studies including 2454 subjects were conducted, spanning six brain disorders (schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease) to evaluate the proposed framework from different perspectives (replication, cross-study comparison, subtle difference identification, and multi-disorder classification). Our results demonstrate the great potential of NeuroMark to identify reproducible and comparable brain network markers, its feasibility to link results across different datasets/studies/disorders, and its sensitivity in identifying biomarkers for patients with challenging mental illnesses.","/content/10.1101/19008631v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008631v1.full.pdf","2019-10-16","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Synthetic apparent diffusion coefficient for high b-value diffusion weighted MRI in Prostate","Purpose: It has been reported that diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with ultrahigh b-value increases the diagnostic power of prostate cancer. DWI imaging with higher b-values is challenging as it commonly suffers from low signal to noise ratio (SNR), distortion and longer scan time. The aim of our study was to develop a technique for quantification of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for higher b-values from lower b-value DW images.
Materials and Methods: Fifteen patient (7 malignant, 8 benign) with prostate cancer were included in this study retrospectively with the institutional ethical committee approval. All images were acquired at 3T MR scanner. The ADC values were calculated using mono-exponential model. Synthetic ADC (sADC) for higher b-value were computed using a log-linear model. Contrast ratio (CR) between prostate lesion and normal tissue on synthetic DWI (sDWI) was computed and compared with original DWI and ADC images.
Results: No significant difference was observed between actual ADC and sADC for b-2000 in all prostate lesions. However; CR increased significantly (p=0.002, paired t-test) in sDWI as compared to DWI. Malignant lesions showed significantly lower sADC as compared to benign lesion (p=0.0116, independent t-test). Mean ( Â± standard deviation) of sADC of malignant lesions was 0.601 Â± 0.06 and for benign lesions was 0.92 Â± 0.09 (10-3mm2/s).
Discussion / Conclusion: Our initial investigation suggests that the ADC values corresponding to higher b-value can be computed using log-linear relationship derived from lower b-values (b = 1000). Our method might help clinician to decide the optimal b-value for prostate lesion identification.","/content/10.1101/19008201v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008201v1.full.pdf","2019-10-16","Radiology and Imaging

"How do World and European Standard Populations impact Burden of Disease studies? A case study of Disability-Adjusted Life Years in Scotland","Background: Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are an established method for quantifying population health needs and guiding prioritisation decisions. Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates aim to ensure comparability between countries and over time by using age-standardised rates (ASR) to account for differences in the age structure of different populations. Different standard populations are used for this purpose but it is not widely appreciated that the choice of standard may affect not only the resulting rates but also the rankings of causes of DALYs. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the choice of standard, using the example of Scotland.

Methods: Estimates of DALYs were derived from the 2016 Scottish Burden of Disease (SBOD) study for an abridged list of 68 causes of disease/injury, representing a three-year annual average across 2014-16. Crude rates of DALYs were calculated using Scottish national population estimates. ASR of DALYs standardised using the GBD World Standard Population (GBD WSP) were compared to those using the 2013 European Standard Population (ESP2013). Differences in ASR and in rank order within the cause list were summarised across all-causes and for each individual cause.

Results: The ranking of causes by DALYs were similar using crude rates or ASR (ESP2013). As expected, rates using ASR (GBD WSP) were around 26% lower. Overall 58 out of 68 causes had a lower ASR using GBD WSP compared with ESP2013, with the largest falls occurring for leading causes of mortality observed in older ages. Gains in ASR were much smaller in scale and largely affected causes that operated early in life. These differences were associated with a substantial change to the ranking of causes when GBD WSP was used compared with ESP2013.

Conclusion: Disease rankings based on ASR of DALYs are strongly influenced by the choice of standard population. While GBD WSP offers international comparability, within-country analyses based on ASR of DALYs should reflect local age structures. For European countries including Scotland ESP2013 may better reflect local disease patterns.","/content/10.1101/19008102v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008102v1.full.pdf","2019-10-16","Public and Global Health

"Mechanistic insights into heterogeneous radiofrequency ablation effects at the left atrial posterior wall during pulmonary vein isolation","Background:
Independent investigations demonstrate greater radiofrequency (RF) ablation effects at left-sided left atrial posterior wall (LAPW) sites.
Objective:
To investigate mechanisms underlying RF ablation heterogeneity during contact-force (CF) and VISITAGâ„¢ Module (Biosense Webster)-guided pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). 
Methods:
Consecutive patients undergoing PVI during atrial overdrive pacing comprised 2 cohorts: intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV, 14-16/min, 6-8ml/kg); high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV, 150/min, Monsoon III, Acutronic). Temperature-controlled (17ml/min, 48oC) RF data was retrospectively assessed at first-annotated (target 15s) LAPW sites: 30W during IPPV; 20W at left-sided sites during HFJV.
Results:
Twenty-five and 15 patients underwent PVI during IPPV and HFJV, respectively. During IPPV, left versus right-sided median impedance drop (ImpD) was 13.6O versus 9.9O (p<0.0001) respectively and mean time to pure R unipolar electrogram (UE) morphology change 4.9s versus 6.7s (p=0.007) respectively. During HFJV, ImpD was greater at left-sided sites (9.7O versus 7.4O, p=0.21) and time to pure R UE significantly shorter: 4.3s versus 6.1s (p=0.02). Minimum case impedance subtracted from pre-RF baseline impedance (BI) generated site-specific <U+0394>BI. Left-sided sites demonstrated significantly greater <U+0394>BI, correlating strongly with Ln(ImpD) - IPPV r=0.84 (0.65 - 0.93), HFJV r=0.77 (0.35 - 0.93). At right-sided sites, <U+0394>BI and Ln(ImpD) were without correlation during IPPV, but correlation was  modest during HFJV (r=0.54, -0.007 - 0.84). 
Conclusions:
<U+0394>BI may usefully indicate catheter-tissue contact surface area (SA). Consequently, greater left-sided LAPW RF effect may result from greater contact SA and in-phase catheter-tissue motion; HFJV may reduce right-sided out-of-phase catheter-tissue motion. Modifying RF delivery based on <U+0394>BI may improve PVI safety and efficacy.","/content/10.1101/19008706v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008706v1.full.pdf","2019-10-15","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Analysis of online information available for treatment of depression","The Internet has become a prime source of health information available to the public. Our aims were to assess the content and quality of online information for the treatment of depression. 
We searched, 'How to cure depression' on Google and analysed the first 200 websites according to the website typology and a standard health information assessment tool, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) criteria (presence of authorship, date, disclosure, and references). We also analyzed content in terms of treatments mentioned and developed a Quality Indicator Score (QIS) based on the guidelines for treating depression from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). 
News websites were the most frequent typology followed by health portals, non-profit, professional and government; commercial websites were the least represented. In the top ten websites, news and health portals remained first and second respectively. Antidepressants were the most mentioned treatment, followed by psychotherapy, lifestyle & exercise, social support, diet. The least mentioned interventions were sunlight & light therapy, routine, and ketamine & psychedelics. Commercial websites preferentially mentioned supplements, while ketamine and psychedelic drugs were the most covered by news outlets. Analysing webpages according to our QIS showed the median of NICE recommended treatments was 2.5 out of 5 possible treatments: antidepressants, lifestyle & exercise, psychotherapy, social support and ECT. Government websites had the highest QIS, news and commercial websites the lowest. Webpages with high QIS ranked higher in Google.","/content/10.1101/19008284v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008284v1.full.pdf","2019-10-14","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Association of rs12722 COL5A1 with Pulmonary Tuberculosis infection: a preliminary case-control study in a Kazakhstani population.","Background: Lung cavitation is the classic hallmark of TB, which facilitates the disease development and transmission. It involves the degradation of lung parenchyma which is mainly made up of collagen fibers by metalloproteinases (MMPs) produced by activated monocyte-derived cells, neutrophils and stromal cells. 
Objective: The following population-based preliminary case-control study of adults with TB and controls without TB will check the possible association between rs1800012 in COL1A1, rs1272222 in COL5A1 genes to human TB susceptibility in Kazakhstan. 
Methods: In this case-control study including 165 samples we examined the associations between TB disease status and demographic variables along with single nucleotide polymorphisms related to COLA1 and COL5A1. The unadjusted <U+03C7>2 and adjusted logistic regression was performed to find out relationships between SNPS and other predictors.
Results: Preliminary findings suggest that there is a statistically significant association of age (OR=0.44, 95% CI:0.21-0.92, p-value=0.03) , social status (OR=0.42, 95% CI:0.201 -0.87, p-value=0.020), HIV status(OR=6.9, 95% CI:1.86 - 25.6, p-value=0.004) and heterozygous rs12722 SNP (OR=2.45, 95% CI:1.16 -5.16 p-value=0.019) polymorphism of COL5A1 gene with TB susceptibility.
Conclusion: The association of collagen genes with TB pathogenesis indicates that anti TB programs should develop new drug regimens that include MMP inhibitors. Therapeutic targeting of MMPs will prevent extracellular matrix degradation and granuloma maturation.","/content/10.1101/19008995v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008995v1.full.pdf","2019-10-11","Epidemiology

"Dynamic interactions of influenza viruses in Hong Kong during 1998-2018","Influenza epidemics cause substantial morbidity and mortality every year worldwide.  Currently, two influenza A subtypes, A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), and type B viruses co-circulate in humans and infection with one type/subtype could provide cross-protection against the others. However, it remains unclear how such ecologic competition via cross-immunity and antigenic mutations that allow immune escape impact influenza epidemic dynamics at the population level. Here we develop a comprehensive model-inference system and apply it to study the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the three influenza types/subtypes in Hong Kong, a city of global public health significance for influenza epidemic and pandemic control. Utilizing long-term influenza surveillance data since 1998, we are able to estimate the strength of cross-immunity between each virus-pairs, the timing and frequency of punctuated changes in population immunity in response to antigenic mutations in influenza viruses, and key epidemiological parameters over the last 20 years including the 2009 pandemic. We find evidence of cross-immunity in all types/subtypes, with strongest cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2). Our results also suggest that A(H3N2) may undergo antigenic mutations in both summers and winters and thus monitoring the virus in both seasons may be important for vaccine development. Overall, our study reveals intricate epidemiological interactions and underscores the importance of simultaneous monitoring of population immunity, incidence rates, and viral genetic and antigenic changes.","/content/10.1101/19008987v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008987v1.full.pdf","2019-10-11","Epidemiology

"Prognostic value of the Residual Cancer Burden index according to breast cancer subtype: validation on a cohort of BC patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","Introduction: The Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) quantifies residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Its predictive value has not been validated on large cohorts with long term follow up. The objective of this work is to independently evaluate the prognostic value of the RCB index depending on BC subtypes (Luminal, HER2 positive and triple negative (TNBCs)).
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the RCB index on surgical specimens from a cohort of T1T3NxM0 BC patients treated with NAC between 2002 and 2012. We analyzed the association between RCB index and relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS) among the global population, after stratification by BC subtypes. 
Results: 717 patients were included (luminal BC (n = 222, 31%), TNBC (n = 319, 44.5%), HER2 positive (n = 176, 24.5%)). After a median follow up of 99.9 months, RCB index was significantly associated with RFS. The RCB0 patients displayed similar prognosis when compared to the RCBI group, while patients from the RCBII and RCBIII classes were at increased risk of relapse (RCBII versus RCB0: HR=3.25 CI [2.1;5.1] p < 0.001; RCBIII versus RCB0: HR=5.6 CI [3.5;8.9] p < 0.001). The prognostic impact of RCB index was significant for TNBC and HER2 positive cancers; but not for luminal cancers (Pinteraction = 0.07). The prognosis of RCBIII patients was poor (8 years RFS: 52.7%, 95% CI [44.8 ; 62.0]) particularly in the TNBC subgroup, where the median RFS was 12.7 months.
Conclusion: RCB index is a reliable prognostic score. RCB accurately identifies patients at a high risk of recurrence (RCBIII) with TNBC or HER2 positive BC who must be offered second-line adjuvant therapies.","/content/10.1101/19008896v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008896v1.full.pdf","2019-10-11","Oncology

Aims: We investigated cardiac structure and function in patients with schizophrenia using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) after excluding medical and metabolic comorbidity. 
Methods: 80 participants underwent CMR to determine biventricular volumes and function and measures of blood pressure, physical activity, and glycated haemoglobin levels. Patients and controls were matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and body surface area. 
Results: Patients with schizophrenia had significantly smaller indexed left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and stroke volume but unaltered ejection fractions relative to controls. LV concentricity and septal thickness were significantly larger in schizophrenia. The findings were largely unchanged after adjusting for smoking or exercise levels and were independent of medication dose and duration. 
Conclusions: Patients with schizophrenia show evidence of prognostically-adverse cardiac remodelling compared to matched controls, independent of conventional risk factors.","/content/10.1101/19008649v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008649v1.full.pdf","2019-10-11","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Genome-wide investigation of DNA methylation in congenital adrenal hyperplasia","Background:
Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are at risk of long-term cognitive and metabolic sequelae. This study investigates genome-wide DNA methylation in patients with CAH to determine whether there is evidence for epigenomic reprogramming as well as any relationship to patient outcome.
Methods:
We analysed CD4+ T cell DNA from 28 patients with CAH (mean age=18.5 Â±6.5 years [y]) and 37 population controls (mean age=17.0 Â±6.1 y) with the Infinium-HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array to measure genome-wide locus-specific DNA methylation levels. Effects of CAH, phenotype and CYP21A2 genotype on methylation were investigated as well as the association between differentially methylated CpGs, metabolic profiles (glucose homeostasis and blood lipid profile) and cognitive outcome. In addition, we report data on a small cohort of 11 patients (mean age=19.1, Â±6.0 y) with CAH who were treated prenatally with dexamethasone (DEX).
Results:
We identified two CpGs to be associated with patient phenotype: cg18486102 (located in the FAIM2 gene; rho=0.58, adjusted p=0.027) and cg02404636 (located in the SFI1 gene; rho=0.58, adjusted p=0.038). cg02404636 was also associated with genotype (rho=0.59, adjusted p=0.024). We did not observe any effect of DEX on DNA methylation in individuals with CAH. No significant association was found between FAIM2 methylation and cognitive or metabolic outcome. However, SFI1 TSS methylation was associated with fasting plasma HDL cholesterol levels (p=0.035).
Conclusion:
In conclusion, higher methylation levels in CpG sites covering FAIM2 and SFI1 were associated with disease severity. Hypermethylation in these genes may have implications for long-term cognitive and metabolic outcome in patients with CAH.","/content/10.1101/19008524v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008524v1.full.pdf","2019-10-11","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

We sought to examine differences in paramedic student academic performance from counties with varying SES in the United States. Student performance data and SES data were combined for counties within the states of California, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Virginia. Linear multiple regression modelling was performed to determine the relationship between income, high school graduation rate, poverty and food insecurity with first-attempt scores on the Fisdap Paramedic Readiness Exam (PRE) versions 3 and 4. Linear regression models indicated that there was a significant relationship between county-level income, poverty, graduation rate, food insecurity, and paramedic student academic performance. It remains unclear what type of relationship exists between individual SES and individual academic performance of paramedic students. These findings support the future collection of individual student level SES data in order to identify issues and mitigate impact on academic performance.","/content/10.1101/19008516v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008516v1.full.pdf","2019-10-11","Medical Education

"Classifying post-traumatic stress disorder using the magnetoencephalographic connectome and machine learning","Given the subjective nature of conventional diagnostic methods for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an objectively measurable biomarker is highly desirable. Macroscopic neural circuits measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) has previously been shown to be indicative of the PTSD phenotype and severity. In the present study, we employed a machine learning-based classification framework using MEG neural synchrony to distinguish combat-related PTSD from trauma-exposed controls. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as the core classification algorithm. A recursive random forest feature selection step was directly incorporated in the nested SVM cross validation process (CV-SVM-rRF-FS) for identifying the most important features for PTSD classification. For the five frequency bands tested, the nested CV-SVM-rRF-FS analysis selected the minimum numbers of edges per frequency that could serve as a PTSD signature and be used as the basis for SVM modelling. Many of the selected edges have been reported previously to be core in PTSD pathophysiology, with frequency-specific patterns also observed. Furthermore, the independent partial least squares discriminant analysis suggested low bias in the nested CV-SVM-rRF-FS process. The final SVM models built with selected features showed excellent PTSD classification performance (area-under-curve value up to 0.9). Testament to its robustness when distinguishing individuals from a heavily-traumatised control group, these developments for a classification model for PTSD also provide a comprehensive machine learning-based computational framework for classifying other mental health challenges using MEG connectome profiles.","/content/10.1101/19008037v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008037v1.full.pdf","2019-10-11","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Machine learning prediction of motor response after deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease","Introduction: Despite careful patient selection for subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS), some Parkinson's disease patients show limited improvement of motor disability. Non-conclusive results from previous prediction studies maintain the need for a simple tool for neurologists that reliably predicts postoperative motor response for individual patients. Establishing such a prediction tool facilitates the clinician to improve patient counselling, expectation management, and postoperative patient satisfaction.
Predictive machine learning models can be used to generate individual outcome predictions instead of correlating pre- and postoperative variables on a group level.
Methods: We developed a machine learning logistic regression prediction model which generates probabilities for experiencing weak motor response one year after surgery. The model analyses preoperative variables and is trained on 90 patients using a ten-fold cross-validation. We intentionally chose to leave out pre-, intra- and postoperative imaging and neurophysiology data, to ensure the usability in clinical practice. 
Weak responders (n = 27) were defined as patients who fail to show clinically relevant improvement on Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II, III or IV.
Results: The model predicts weak responders with an average area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 0.88 (standard deviation: 0.14), a true positive rate of 0.85 and a false positive rate of 0.25, and a diagnostic accuracy of 78%. The reported influences of the individual preoperative variables are useful for clinical interpretation of the model, but cannot been interpreted separately regardless of the other variables in the model.
Conclusion: The very good diagnostic accuracy of the presented prediction model confirms the utility of machine-learning based motor response prediction one year after STN DBS implantation, based on clinical preoperative variables.
After reproduction and validation in a prospective cohort, this prediction model holds a tremendous potential to be a supportive tool for clinicians during the preoperative counseling.","/content/10.1101/19006841v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006841v2.full.pdf","2019-10-10",NA,"Habets","/highwire/citation/69502/bibtext",251,"211119-251","21/11/2019","69502"
"Validation of Serum Neurofilaments as Prognostic & Potential Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers for ALS","Objective. Identify preferred neurofilament assays, and clinically validate serum NfL and pNfH as prognostic and potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers relevant to ALS therapy development. 

Methods. Prospective, multi-center, longitudinal observational study of patients with ALS (n=229), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS, n=20) and progressive muscular atrophy (PMA, n=11). Biological specimens were collected, processed and stored according to strict standard operating procedures (SOPs) 1. Neurofilament assays were performed in a blinded manner by independent contract research organizations (CROs). 

Results. For serum NfL and pNfH measured using the Simoa assay, missing data (i.e. both technical replicates below the lower limit of detection (LLD) was not encountered. For the Iron Horse and Euroimmun pNfH assays, such missingness was encountered in ~4% and ~10% of serum samples respectively. Mean coefficients of variation (CVs) for pNfH in serum and CSF were ~4-5% and ~2-3% respectively in all assays. Baseline NfL concentration, but not pNfH, predicted the future ALSFRS-R slope and survival. Incorporation of baseline serum NfL into mixed effects models of ALSFRS-R slopes yields an estimated sample size saving of ~8%. Depending on the method used to estimate effect size, use of serum NfL (and perhaps pNfH) as pharmacodynamic biomarkers, instead of the ALSFRS-R slope, yields significantly larger sample size savings. 

Conclusions. Serum NfL may be considered a clinically validated prognostic biomarker for ALS. Serum NfL (and perhaps pNfH), quantified using the Simoa assay, have potential utility as pharmacodynamic biomarkers of treatment effect.","/content/10.1101/19002998v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002998v2.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Neurology

"Contribution of Marijuana Legalization to the U.S. Opioid Mortality Epidemic: Individual and Combined Experience of 27 States and District of Columbia","Background:   Prior studies of U.S. states as of 2013 and one state as of 2015 suggested that marijuana availability reduces opioid mortality (marijuana protection hypothesis). This investigation tested the hypothesis with opioid mortality trends updated to 2017 and by evaluating all states and the District of Columbia (D.C.).
Methods:   Opioid mortality data obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used to compare opioid death rate trends in each marijuana-legalizing state and D.C. before and after medicinal and recreational legalization implementation and their individual and cumulative aggregate trends with concomitant trends in non-legalizing states. The Joinpoint Regression Program identified statistically-significant mortality trends and when they occurred.
Results:   Of 23 individually evaluable legalizing jurisdictions, 78% had evidence for a statistically-significant acceleration of opioid death rates after medicinal or recreational legalization implementation at greater rates than their pre-legalization rate or the concurrent composite rate in non-legalizing states. All four jurisdictions evaluable for recreational legalization had evidence (p <0.05) for subsequent opioid death rate increases, one had a distinct acceleration, and one a reversal of prior decline. Since 2009-2012, when the cumulative-aggregate opioid death rate in the legalizing jurisdictions was the same as in the non-legalizing group, the legalizing group's rate accelerated increasingly faster (p=0.009). By 2017 it was 67% greater than in the non-legalizing group (p<0.05).
Conclusions:   The marijuana protection hypothesis is not supported by recent U.S. data on opioid mortality trends. Instead, legalizing marijuana appears to have contributed to the nation's opioid mortality epidemic.","/content/10.1101/19007393v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007393v2.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Public and Global Health

"Surgical Intervention for Paediatric Infusion-Related Extravasation Injury: A Systematic Review","Objectives
This systematic review aims to assess the quality of literature supporting surgical interventions for paediatric extravasation injury and to determine and summarize their outcomes.

Methods
We performed a systematic review by searching Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to February 2019. All studies other than case reports were eligible for inclusion if the population was younger than 18 years old, there was a surgical intervention aimed at treating extravasation injury and they reported on outcomes. Risk of bias was graded according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study quality assessment tools.

Results
26 studies involving 728 children were included. One before and after study and 25 case series. Extravasation injuries were mainly confined to skin and subcutaneous tissues but severe complications were also encountered, including amputation (one toe and one below elbow). Of the surgical treatments described, the technique of multiple puncture wounds and instillation of saline and/or hyaluronidase was the most commonly used. However, there were no studies in which its effectiveness was tested against another treatment or a control and details of functional and aesthetic outcomes were generally lacking. 

Conclusion

"Using Hierarchical Clustering to Explore Patterns of Deprivation Among English Local Authorities","Background
The English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is widely used as a measure of deprivation of geographic areas in analyses of health inequalities between places. However, similarly ranked areas can differ substantially in the underlying domains and indicators that are used to calculate the IMD score. These subdomains and indicators contain a richer set of data that might be useful for classifying local authorities. Clustering methods offer a set of techniques to identify groups of areas with similar patterns of deprivation. This could offer insights into areas that face similar challenges.

Methods
Hierarchical agglomerative (i.e. bottom-up) clustering methods were applied to domain scores for 152 upper-tier local authorities. Recent advances in statistical testing allow clusters to be identified that are unlikely to have arisen from random partitioning of a homogeneous group. The resulting clusters are described in terms of their subdomain scores and basic geographic and demographic characteristics.

Results
Five statistically significant clusters of local authorities were identified. These clusters represented local authorities that were: 
(i) 	Most deprived, predominantly urban;
(ii)	Least deprived, predominantly rural;
(iii) 	Less deprived, rural;
(iv)	Deprived, high crime, high barriers to housing; and
(v)	Deprived, low education, poor employment, poor health.

Conclusion
Hierarchical clustering methods identify five distinct clusters that do not correspond closely to quintiles of deprivation. These methods can be used to draw on the richer set of information contained in the IMD subdomains and may help to identify places that face similar challenges, and places that appear similar in terms of IMD scores, but that face different challenges.","/content/10.1101/19006957v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006957v2.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Public and Global Health

"Implementation of a specialist pneumonia intervention nurse service significantly lowers mortality for community acquired pneumonia","Objectives: Evaluate clinical outcomes associated with implementing a specialist pneumonia intervention nursing (SPIN) service, to improve adherence with BTS guidelines for hospitalised community acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Design: Retrospective cohort study, comparing periods before (2011-13) and after (2014-16) SPIN service implementation. 

Setting: Single NHS trust across two hospital sites in Leicester City, England

Participants: 13,496 adult (aged =16) admissions to hospital with a primary diagnosis of CAP 

Interventions: The SPIN service was set up in 2013/2014 to provide clinical review of new CAP admissions; assurance of guidelines adherence; delivery of CAP clinical education and clinical follow up after discharge.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were proportions of CAP cases receiving antibiotic treatment within 4 hours of admission and change in crude in-hospital mortality rate. Secondary outcomes were adjusted mortality rate and length of stay (LOS).

Results: The SPIN service reviewed 38% of CAP admissions in 2014-16. 82% of these admissions received antibiotic treatment in <4 hours (68.5% in the national audit). Compared with the pre-SPIN period, there was a significant reduction in both 30-day (OR=0.77 [0.70-0.85], p<0.0001) and in-hospital mortality (OR=0.66 [0.60-0.73], p<0.0001) after service implementation, with a review by the service having the largest independent 30-day mortality benefit (HR=0.60 [0.53-0.67], p<0.0001). There was no change in LOS (median 6 days).

Conclusions: Implementation of a SPIN service improves adherence with BTS guidelines and achieves significant reductions in CAP associated mortality. This enhanced model of care is low cost, highly effective and readily adoptable in secondary care.","/content/10.1101/19007336v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007336v2.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Respiratory Medicine

"The prevalence of scabies, pyoderma and other communicable dermatoses in the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau","Background: Skin diseases represent a significant public health problem in most low and middle income settings. Nevertheless, there is a relative paucity of high-quality epidemiological data on the prevalence of these conditions. Materials/methods: We conducted two cross-sectional population-based skin-surveys of children (6 months to 9 years old) in the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau during the dry season (February-March 2018) and the wet season (June-July 2018). Following a period of training,  a nurse performed a standardised examination for communicable dermatoses for each participant. We calculated the prevalence of each skin condition and investigated demographic associations. Results: 1062 children were enrolled in the dry season survey of whom 318 (29.9%) had at least one skin diseases.  The most common diagnosis was tinea capitis (154/1062, 14.5% - 95% CI 12.5-16.8%) followed by tinea corporis (84/1062, 7.9% - 95% CI 6.4-9.7%), pyoderma (82/1062, 7.7% - 95% CI 6.2-9.5%) and scabies (56/1062. 5.2% - 95%CI 4.0 - 6.8%). 320 children were enrolled in the wet season survey of whom 121 (37.8%) had at least one skin problem. Tinea capitis remained the most common diagnosis (79/320, 24.7% - 95% CI 20.1 - 29.9%), followed by pyoderma (38/320, 11.9% - 95% CI 8.6-16.1%), tinea corporis (23/320, 7.2% - 95% 4.7 - 10.7%) and scabies (6/320, 1.9% - 95% CI 0.8-4.2%). Conclusions: Our study, which utilised robust population-based cluster random sampling methodology,  demonstrates the substantial disease burden caused by common communicable dermatoses in this setting. Given these findings, there is a need to consider common dermatoses as part of Universal Health Coverage to deliver skin-health for all.","/content/10.1101/19000257v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000257v3.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Assessing the impact of data aggregation in model predictions of HAT transmission and control activities","Since the turn of the century, the global community has made great progress towards the elimination of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Elimination programs, primarily relying on screening and treatment campaigns, have also created a rich database of HAT epidemiology. Mathematical models calibrated with these data can help to fill remaining gaps in our understanding of HAT transmission dynamics, including key operational research questions such as whether integrating vector control with current intervention strategies is needed to achieve HAT elimination. Here we explore, via an ensemble of models and simulation studies, which aspects of the available data and level of data aggregation, such as separation by disease stage, would be most useful for better understanding transmission dynamics and improving model reliability in making future predictions of control and elimination strategies.","/content/10.1101/19005991v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005991v2.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Multimorbidity and consultation time: a systematic review","Background: Multimorbidity (MM) is one of the major challenges currently facing health systems at the international level and tends to occupy a considerable part of the daily activity of physicians around the world. It is important to think about the medical approach to dealing with patients with multimorbidity in order to maximize the quality of the services provided by national health services, and thus to secure a better quality of life for these patients. Information about the time spent in a medical consultation with a patient with MM criteria is essential to better organize and deliver healthcare. As far as we know, no previous review has summarized the data relating to how having MM affects the length of the average consultation time.
Objective: To review all the experimental observational studies that describe the impact of having MM on the average time of a medical consultation.
Methods: This systematic review was performed considering the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The systematic online searches of the Embase and PubMed databases were undertaken, from January 2000 to August 2018. The studies were independently screened by two reviewers to decide which ones met the inclusion criteria. (Kappa=0.84 and Kappa=0.82). Differing opinions were solved by a third person. This systematic review included people with MM criteria as participants (two or more chronic conditions in the same individual). The type of outcome included was explicitly defined - the length of medical appointments with patients with MM criteria. Any strategies aiming to analyse the impact of MM on the average consultation time were considered. The comparator used was the length of time of medical appointment for patients without MM criteria. Experimental and observational studies were included.
Results: Of 85 articles identified, only 1 observational study was included. The study shows that there is a clear trend for patients with MM criteria to have longer consultations than patients without MM criteria (p<0.001). The global quality of this study was considered Satisfactory.
Conclusions: It is imperative to study the consultation time spent on patients with MM criteria. Finding a longer consultation time indicates it is important to rethink and adapt GPs lists and time planning to be able to give better medical care to patients with MM by providing agendas that have specific times set aside for these patients and allocating enough time for every task required.","/content/10.1101/19007328v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007328v2.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Primary Care Research

"The impact of reactive mass vaccination campaigns on measles outbreaks in the Katanga region, Democratic Republic of Congo","The Katanga region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been struck by repeated epidemics of measles. In many of the affected health zones, reactive mass vaccination campaigns were conducted in response to the outbreaks. Here, we attempted to determine how effective campaigns were in curtailing a large outbreak in 2015. Using a model of measles transmission we compared observed case numbers to a counterfactual of no campaigns, by first fitting a model to the data including the campaigns and then re-running this without vaccination. Focusing on eight of the 68 health zones in the Katanga region, we estimated the reactive campaigns to have reduced the size of the outbreaks by approximately 21,000 (IQR: 16,000--27,000; 95% CI: 8300--38,000), or 21% (IQR: 17%--25%, 95% CI: 9.3%--34%) of possible measles cases. There was considerable heterogeneity in the impact of campaigns, with campaigns startgin earlier after the start of an outbreak being more impactful. We further sought to establish whether the spatial pattern of the outbreak could have been determined in advance to help prioritise areas for vaccination campaigns and speed up the response. The best predictors of outbreak size among all the health zones were vaccination coverage derived from cluster surveys and outbreak size in 2010-13. This, combined with the fact that the vast majority of reported cases were in under-5 year olds, would suggest that there are systematic issues of undervaccination. If this was to continue, outbreaks would be expected to continue to occur in the affected health zones at regular intervals, mostly concentrated in under-5 year olds. Taken together, our findings suggest that while a strong routine vaccination regime remains the most effective means of measles control, it might be possible to improve the effectiveness of reactive campaigns by considering predictive factors to trigger a more targeted vaccination response.","/content/10.1101/19003434v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003434v3.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Epidemiology

"Molecular point-of-care testing for influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus: comparison of workflow parameters for the ID Now and cobas Liat systems","Aims: 
Point-of-care (POC) tests for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) offer the potential to improve patient management and antimicrobial stewardship. Studies have focused on performance; however, no workflow assessments have been published comparing POC molecular tests. This study compared the Liat and ID Now systems workflow, to assist end-users in selecting an influenza and/or RSV POC test.

Methods:
Staffing, walk-away, and turnaround time (TAT) of the Liat and ID Now systems were determined using 40 nasopharyngeal samples, positive for influenza or RSV. The ID Now system requires separate tests for influenza and RSV, so parallel (two instruments) and sequential (one instrument) workflows were evaluated. 

Results:
The ID Now ranged 4.1-6.2 minutes for staffing, 1.9-10.9 minutes for walk-away and 6.4-15.8 minutes for TAT per result. The Liat ranged 1.1-1.8 minutes for staffing, 20.0-20.5 minutes for walk-away and 21.3-22.0 minutes for TAT. Mean walk-away time comprised 38.0% (influenza positive) and 68.1% (influenza negative) of TAT for ID Now and 93.7% (influenza/RSV) for Liat. The ID Now parallel workflow resulted in medians of 5.9 minutes for staffing, 9.7 minutes for walk-away, and 15.6 minutes for TAT. Assuming prevalence of 20% influenza and 20% RSV, the ID Now sequential workflow resulted in medians of 9.4 minutes for staffing, 17.4 minutes for walk-away, and 27.1 minutes for TAT. 

Conclusions:
The ID Now and Liat systems offer different workflow characteristics. Key considerations for implementation include value of both influenza and RSV results, clinical setting, staffing capacity, and instrument(s) placement.","/content/10.1101/19008227v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008227v1.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"A Multiomics Approach to Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease: Focused Review and Roadmap","Etiological and clinical heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a common characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. This heterogeneity complicates diagnosis, treatment, and the design and testing of new drugs. An important line of research is discovery of multimodal biomarkers that will facilitate the targeting of subpopulations with homogeneous pathophysiological signatures. High-throughput â€˜omicsâ€™ are unbiased data driven techniques that probe the complex etiology of Alzheimer's disease from multiple levels (e.g. network, cellular, and molecular) and thereby account for pathophysiological heterogeneity in clinical populations. This review focuses on data reduction analyses that identify complementary disease-relevant perturbations for three omics techniques: neuroimaging-based subtypes, metabolomics-derived metabolite panels, and genomics-related polygenic risk scores. Neuroimaging can track accrued neurodegeneration and other sources of network impairments, metabolomics provides a global small-molecule snapshot that is sensitive to ongoing pathological processes, and genomics characterizes relatively invariant genetic risk factors representing key pathways associated with Alzheimer's disease. Following this focused review, we present a roadmap for assembling these multiomics measurements into a diagnostic tool highly predictive of individual clinical trajectories, to further the goal of personalized medicine in Alzheimer's disease.","/content/10.1101/19008615v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008615v1.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Neurology

"Inconsistent Addiction Treatment for Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery for Injection Drug Use-Associated Infective Endocarditis","Introduction: 
Cases of injection drug use-related infective endocarditis (IDU-IE) requiring surgery are rising in the setting of the current U.S. opioid epidemic. We thus aimed to determine the nature of addiction interventions in the perioperative period.

Methods: 
This is a retrospective review of surgical IDU-IE from 2011 to 2016 at a tertiary care center in New Haven, Connecticut. The data collected included substances consumed recreationally, consultations by social work (SW), psychiatry, pharmacotherapy for addiction, and evidence of enrollment in a drug rehabilitation program upon discharge. 
Among patients with active drug use (ADU), we compared the 24-month survival of those who received at least one form of addiction intervention to that of those who did not. 

Results: 
Forty-two patients (75%) had active drug use. Among them, 22 used heroin. Forty-one patients (73.2%) saw SW, 17 (30.4%) saw psychiatry; 14 (25%) saw neither SW nor psychiatry. 
Twenty-one patients (37.5%) received methadone, 6 (10.7%) received buprenorphine, 1 (0.02%) received naltrexone; 26 (46.4%) did not receive any pharmacotherapy. Fifteen patients (26.8%) attended a drug rehabilitation program, 13 (86.7%) of whom had seen SW and 8 (53%) psychiatry. Among patients with ADU, there was no statistically significant difference in survival between those who received at least one intervention and those who did not (p=0.1 by log rank).

Conclusion: 
Addiction interventions are deployed inconsistently for patients with surgical IDU-IE. Untreated substance use disorder and recurrent endocarditis are the leading cause of death in this population. Studying best-practices for perioperative interventions in IDU-IE and establishing protocols are of the upmost importance.","/content/10.1101/19008482v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008482v1.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Addiction Medicine

"Joint modelling of individual trajectories, within-individual variability and a later outcome: systolic blood pressure through childhood and left ventricular mass in early adulthood","Within-individual variability of repeatedly-measured exposures may predict later outcomes: e.g. blood pressure (BP) variability (BPV) is an independent cardiovascular risk factor above and beyond mean BP. Since two-stage methods, known to introduce bias, are typically used to investigate such associations, we introduce a joint modelling approach, examining associations of both mean BP and BPV across childhood to left ventricular mass (indexed to height; LVMI) in early adulthood with data from the UK's Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Using multilevel models, we allow BPV to vary between individuals (a ""random effect"") as well as to depend on covariates (allowing for heteroscedasticity). We further distinguish within-clinic variability (""measurement error"") from visit-to-visit BPV. BPV was predicted to be greater at older ages, at higher bodyweights, and in females, and was positively correlated with mean BP. BPV had a positive association with LVMI (10% increase in SD(BP) was predicted to increase LVMI by mean = 0.42% (95% credible interval: -0.47%, 1.38%)), but this association became negative (mean = -1.56%, 95% credible interval: -5.01%, 0.44%)) once the effect of mean BP on LVMI was adjusted for. This joint modelling approach offers a flexible method of relating repeatedly-measured exposures to later outcomes.","/content/10.1101/19008474v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008474v1.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Epidemiology

"Living alone, loneliness and lack of emotional support as predictors of suicide and self-harm: seven-year follow up of the UK Biobank cohort","Background: The association between loneliness and suicide is complex, poorly understood, and there are no prior longitudinal studies. We aimed to investigate the relationship between living alone, loneliness and emotional support as predictors of death by suicide and self-harm.
Methods: Between 2006 and 2010 UK Biobank recruited over 0.5m people aged 37-73. This data was linked to prospective hospital admission and mortality records. Adjusted Cox regression models were used to investigate the relationship between self-reported measures of loneliness, emotional support and living arrangements and death by suicide and self-harm.
Results: For women, there was no evidence that living arrangements, loneliness or lack of emotional support were associated with death by suicide. However, for men, both living alone (Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.19 95%CI 1.47-3.27) and with non-partners (HR 2.17 95%CI 1.28-3.69) were associated with death by suicide, independently of loneliness, which had a modest relationship with suicide in men (HR 1.45 95%CI 0.99-2.12). Associations between living alone and self-harm were explained by health for women, and by health, loneliness and emotional support for men. In fully adjusted models, loneliness was associated with hospital admissions for self-harm in both women (HR 1.90 95%CI 1.58-2.29) and men (HR 1.75 95%CI 1.41-2.18). 
Conclusions: For men -but not for women- living alone or with a non-partner increased the risk of suicide, a finding not explained by loneliness. Loneliness may be more important as a risk factor for self-harm than for suicide, and appears to mitigate against any protective effect of cohabitation.","/content/10.1101/19008458v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008458v1.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Epidemiology

"Isolated night cough in children: how does it differ from wheeze?","Background: 
Children with night cough but no wheeze might have a mild form of asthma (cough variant asthma), sharing risk factors with children who wheeze, and possibly developing wheeze later.
Methods: 
We compared risk factors of children with isolated night cough and children with wheeze in the Leicester Respiratory Cohort study at ages 1, 4, 6, and 9 years. We also compared prognoses of children with isolated night cough, children with wheeze, and asymptomatic children. 
Results: 
Among 4,101 children at age 1 year, 2,854 at 4, 2,369 at 6, and 1,688 at 9 years, the prevalence of isolated night cough was 10% at age 1 and 18% in older children, while prevalence of wheeze decreased from 35% at 1 year to 13% at age 9. Although many risk factors were the same for cough and wheeze, day care, reflux, and family history of bronchitis were more strongly associated with cough, and male sex and family history of asthma with wheeze. Over one-third of pre-schoolers with cough continued to cough at school age, but their risk of developing wheeze was similar to that of children asymptomatic at earlier surveys. Wheeze tracked more strongly throughout childhood than cough.
Conclusions: 
Some risk factors for cough and wheeze were shared and some were not; there was little evidence that children with isolated night cough have an increased risk of future wheeze. This suggests that only a fraction of children with isolated night cough might have a variant of asthma, if at all.","/content/10.1101/19007500v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007500v1.full.pdf","2019-10-10","Respiratory Medicine

"Distance to white matter trajectories is associated with treatment response to internal capsule deep brain stimulation in treatment-resistant depression","Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an innovative treatment for treatment-resistant depression. DBS is usually targeted at specific anatomical landmarks, with patients responding to DBS in approximately 50% of cases. Attention has recently shifted to white matter tracts to explain DBS response, with initial open-label trials targeting white matter tracts yielding much higher response rates (>70%).
Methods: We associated distance to individual white matter tracts around the stimulation target in the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule to treatment response. We performed diffusion magnetic resonance tractography of the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle and the anterior thalamic radiation in fourteen patients that participated in our randomized clinical trial. We combined the tract reconstructions with the postoperative images to identify the DBS leads and estimated the distance between tracts and leads, which we subsequently associated with treatment response.
Results: Stimulation closer to both tracts was significantly correlated to a larger symptom decrease (r=0.61, p=0.02), suggesting that stimulation more proximal to the tracts was beneficial. There was no difference in lead placement with respect to anatomical landmarks, which could mean that differences in treatment response were driven by individual differences in white matter anatomy.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that deep brain stimulation of the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule could benefit from targeting white matter bundles. We recommend acquiring diffusion magnetic resonance data for each individual patient.","/content/10.1101/19008268v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008268v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Real-world Drug Regimens for Multiple Myeloma in a Swiss Population (2012 to 2017): cost-outcome description","Background:
Novel drugs are dynamically changing current treatment regimens for multiple myeloma (MM). Novel drugs have improved prognosis of MM patients in clinical studies but are expensive. Little is known about up-to-date real-world application and costs.
Methods: 
We performed a retrospective observational cohort analysis (cost-outcome description; 2012-2017) in a claims database of a major Swiss health insurance company which covers 14% of the Swiss population (Helsana Versicherungen AG). We used primary (MM diagnoses via ICD-10) and secondary features (prescribed MM-specific drugs) as inclusion criteria and defined a hierarchy of drug regimens to classify treatments as: 1) proteasome inhibitor (PI)-based regimen (e.g. bortezomib); 2) IMID-based regimen (e.g. lenalidomide); 3) chemotherapy (CHEMO)-based regimen (e.g. bendamustin); 4) monoclonal antibody (MAB)-based regimen (e.g. daratunumab). Direct medical costs of mandatory health insurance were analysed in 2017 Swiss Francs (CHF; third party payer perspective).
Results: 
Overall, we identified n=1054 prevalent MM patients (2012-2017) and n=378 incident MM patients (2015-2017; men: 47.1%; age group <=75 years: 48.7%). The number of prevalent patients per year increased over time (from n=314 in 2012 to n=645 in 2017).
PI-based regimens were the most frequent first line approach for incident patients (76.0%), followed by IMID-based (21.9%) and CHEMO-based regimens (2.1%). Only four patients were treated with MAB-drugs. For later lines, IMID-based regimens were most often used (2nd line: 56.4%; 3rd line: 2 of 3 patients), followed by PI-based regimens (43.6% and 1 of 3 patients, respectively). 161 of 1054 prevalent MM patients (15.3%) were treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 4 patients with allogeneic HSCT.
Average costs per patient per treatment line varied considerably (reliable data available from 2012 to 2014; mean duration of lines between 112 and 388 days): PI-based regimens: CHF 81352; IMID-based: CHF 73495; CHEMO-based: CHF 683. Mean daily costs under MM treatment stepwise increased from CHF 209 in 2012 to CHF 254 in 2017 (relative increase: 21.5%). Annual direct medical costs in Switzerland for seven novel MM drugs were extrapolated to be 60.1 Mio CHF in 2012 and 118.6 Mio CHF in 2017 (relative increase: 97.3%), corresponding to mean annual outpatient MM drug costs per patient of CHF 28000 in 2017.
Annual death rates decreased systematically from 18.6% in 2012 to 15.5% in 2017 (p for trend: 0.03). No statistically significant difference in death rates emerged for 2017 compared with 2012 (risk ratio: 0.83; 95%-CI: 0.63 to 1.10; absolute risk reduction: 3.1%).
Conclusions:
Current treatment patterns for MM patients in Switzerland show variation concerning applied drug regimens as well as costs.

"Towards a brain signature of chronic pain using cerebral blood flow spatial covariance analysis in people with chronic knee pain","Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a common problem globally. Current evidence suggests that maladaptive modulation of central pain pathways is associated with pain chronicity following e.g. chronic post-operative pain after knee replacement. Other factors such as low mood, anxiety and tendency to catastrophize seem to also be important contributors. We aimed to identify a chronic pain brain signature that discriminates chronic pain from pain-free conditions using cerebral blood flow (CBF) measures, and explore how this signature relates to the chronic pain experience. In 44 chronic knee pain patients and 29 pain-free controls, we acquired CBF data (using arterial spin labelling) and T1-weighted images. Participants completed a series of questionnaires related to affective processes, and pressure and cuff algometry to assess pain sensitization. Two factor scores were extracted from these scores representing negative affect and pain sensitization, respectively. A spatial covariance principal components analysis of CBF identified five components that significantly discriminated chronic pain patients from controls, with the unified network achieving 0.83 discriminatory accuracy (area under the curve). In chronic knee pain, significant patterns of relative hypo-perfusion were evident in anterior regions of the default mode and salience network hubs, while hyperperfusion was seen in posterior default mode regions, the thalamus, and sensory regions. One component was positively correlated to the pain sensitization score (r=.43, p=.006), suggesting that this CBF pattern reflects the neural activity changes encoding pain sensitization. Here, we report the first chronic knee pain-related brain signature, pointing to a brain signature underpinning the central aspects of pain sensitisation.","/content/10.1101/19008326v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008326v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Radiology and Imaging

"APOE interacts with tau PET to influence memory independently of amyloid PET","Objective: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) interacts with AD pathology to promote disease progression. Studies of APOE risk primarily focus on amyloid, however, and little research has assessed its interaction with tau pathology independent of amyloid. The current study investigated the moderating effect of APOE genotype on independent associations of amyloid and tau PET with cognition.

Methods: Participants included 297 older adults without dementia from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Regression equations modeled associations between cognitive domains and (1) cortical AÃŸ PET levels adjusting for tau PET and (2) medial temporal lobe (MTL) tau PET levels adjusting for AÃŸ PET, including interactions with APOE e4 carrier status.

Results: Adjusting for tau PET, AÃŸ was not associated with cognition and did not interact with e4 status. In contrast, adjusting for AÃŸ PET, MTL tau PET was significantly associated with all cognitive domains. Further, there was a moderating effect of e4 status on MTL tau and memory with the strongest negative associations in e4 carriers and at high levels of tau. This interaction persisted even among only AÃŸ negative individuals. 

Interpretation: APOE e4 genotype strengthens the negative association between MTL tau and memory independently of AÃŸ, although the converse is not observed, and this association may be particularly strong at high levels of tau. These findings suggest that APOE may interact with tau independently of AÃŸ and that elevated MTL tau confers negative cognitive consequences in AÃŸ negative e4 carriers.","/content/10.1101/19008318v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008318v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Neurology

"Identification of newborns at risk for autism using electronic medical records and machine learning","Importance: Current approaches for early identification of individuals at high risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the general population are limited, where most ASD patients are not identified until after the age of 4. This is despite substantial evidence suggesting that early diagnosis and intervention improves developmental course and outcome.
Objective: Develop a machine learning (ML) method predicting the diagnosis of ASD in offspring in a general population sample, using parental electronic medical records (EMR) available before childbirth 
Design: Prognostic study of EMR data within a single Israeli health maintenance organization, for the parents of 1,397 ASD children (ICD-9/10), and 94,741 non-ASD children born between January 1st, 1997 through December 31st, 2008. The complete EMR record of the parents was used to develop various ML models to predict the risk of having a child with ASD. 
Main outcomes and measures: Routinely available parental sociodemographic information, medical histories and prescribed medications data until offspring's birth were used to generate features to train various machine learning algorithms, including multivariate logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Prediction performance was evaluated with 10-fold cross validation, by computing C statistics, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false positive rate, and precision (positive predictive value, PPV).  
Results: All ML models tested had similar performance, achieving an average C statistics of 0.70, sensitivity of 28.63%, specificity of 98.62%, accuracy of 96.05%, false positive rate of 1.37%, and positive predictive value of 45.85% for predicting ASD in this dataset.
Conclusion and relevance: ML algorithms combined with EMR capture early life ASD risk. Such approaches may be able to enhance the ability for accurate and efficient early detection of ASD in large populations of children.","/content/10.1101/19008367v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008367v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Diagnosing Cornelia de Lange syndrome and related neurodevelopmental disorders using RNA-sequencing","Neurodevelopmental phenotypes represent major indications for children undergoing clinical exome sequencing. However, up to 50% of cases remain undiagnosed even upon periodic exome reanalysis. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can boost diagnostic yield in neuromuscular diseases, but its utility in neurodevelopmental disorders is hampered out of concern for sourcing relevant tissue for RNA analysis. Here we show human B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) share the transcriptional repertoire of brain tissue for a large subset of neurodevelopmental Mendelian genes, enabling testing of over 1000 genetic syndromes. LCLs also showed a 1.8-fold increase in the number of genes causing neurodevelopmental phenotypes when compared to whole blood (LCL, n = 1706; whole blood, n = 917) indicating a more robust testing landscape. We applied an RNA-seq diagnostic pipeline on LCLs from patients with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a rare multisystem neurodevelopment disorder and found 100% sensitivity for detection of abnormal splicing and 90% sensitivity for detecting all pathogenic events. Application of the pipeline on unsolved cases of CdLS revealed abnormal splicing and pathogenic coding variants in NIPBL and BRD4. This work demonstrates that the LCL transcriptome enables broad, frontline or reflexive, diagnostic testing for neurodevelopmental disorders.","/content/10.1101/19008300v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008300v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"The Causal Effects of Health Conditions and Risk Factors on Social and Socioeconomic Outcomes: Mendelian Randomization in UK Biobank","Objectives: To estimate the causal effect of health conditions and risk factors on social and socioeconomic outcomes in UK Biobank. Evidence on socioeconomic impacts is important to understand because it can help governments, policy-makers and decision-makers allocate resources efficiently and effectively.

Design: We used Mendelian randomization to estimate the causal effects of eight health conditions (asthma, breast cancer, coronary heart disease, depression, eczema, migraine, osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes) and five health risk factors (alcohol intake, body mass index [BMI], cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking) on 19 social and socioeconomic outcomes. 

Setting: UK Biobank.

Participants: 337,009 men and women of white British ancestry, aged between 39 and 72 years. 

Main outcome measures: Annual household income, employment, deprivation (measured by the Townsend deprivation index [TDI]), degree level education, happiness, loneliness, and 13 other social and socioeconomic outcomes.

Results: Results suggested that BMI, smoking and alcohol intake affect many socioeconomic outcomes. For example, smoking was estimated to reduce household income (mean difference = -24,394, 95% confidence interval (CI): -33,403 to -15,384), the chance of owning accommodation (absolute percentage change [APC] = -21.5%, 95% CI: -29.3% to -13.6%), being satisfied with health (APC = -32.4%, 95% CI: -48.9% to -15.8%), and of obtaining a university degree (APC = -73.8%, 95% CI: -90.7% to -56.9%), while also increasing deprivation (mean difference in TDI = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.64, approximately 236% of a decile of TDI). There was evidence that asthma increased deprivation and decreased both household income and the chance of obtaining a university degree, and migraine reduced the chance of having a weekly leisure or social activity, especially in men. For other associations, estimates were null.

Conclusions: Higher BMI, alcohol intake and smoking were all estimated to adversely affect multiple social and socioeconomic outcomes. Effects were not detected between health conditions and socioeconomic outcomes using Mendelian randomization, with the exceptions of depression, asthma and migraines. This may reflect true null associations, selection bias given the relative health and age of participants in UK Biobank, and/or lack of power to detect effects.","/content/10.1101/19008250v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008250v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Public and Global Health

"DyeVer PLUS EZ system for Preventing Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Diagnostic Coronary Angiography and/or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A UK-Based Cost-Utility Analysis","Background: Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a complication commonly associated with invasive angiographic procedures and is considered the leading cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury. CI-AKI can lead to a prolonged hospital stay, with a substantial economic impact, and increased mortality. The DyeVert PLUS EZ system (FDA approved and CE marked) is a device that has been developed to divert a portion of the theoretical injected contrast media volume (CMV), reducing the overall injected contrast media and aortic reflux and potentially improving long-term health outcomes. 
Objectives: To assess the long-term costs and health outcomes associated with the introduction of the DyeVert PLUS EZ system into the health care service for the prevention of CI-AKI in a cohort of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3-4 undergoing Diagnostic Coronary Angiography (DAG) and/or Percutaneous Coronary intervention (PCI), compared with current practice. 
Methods: A de novo economic model was developed based on the current pathway of managing patients undergoing DAG and/or PCI and on evidence related to the clinical effectiveness of DyeVert, in terms of its impact on relevant clinical outcomes and health service resource use. Clinical data used to populate the model were derived from the literature or were based on assumptions informed by expert clinical input. Costs included in the model were obtained from the literature and UK-based routine sources. Probabilistic distributions were assigned to the majority of model parameters so that a probabilistic analysis could be undertaken, while deterministic sensitivity analyses were also carried out to explore the impact of key parameter variation on the model results. 
Results: Base-case results indicate that the intervention leads to cost savings (- 3,878) and improved effectiveness (+ 0.02 QALYs) over the patients lifetime, compared with current practice. Output from the probabilistic analysis supports the high likelihood of the intervention being cost-effective across presented willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. The overall long-term cost saving for the NHS associated with introduction of the intervention for each cohort of patients is over 175 million. The cost savings are mainly driven by lower risk of subsequent diseases and associated costs
Conclusions: Introduction of the DyeVer PLUS EZ system has the potential to reduce costs for the health care service and lead to improved clinical outcomes for patients with CKD stage 3-4 undergoing angiographic procedures.","/content/10.1101/19008185v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008185v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Health Economics

"Effect of a simple exercise programme on hospitalisation-associated disability in older patients: a randomised controlled trial.","Objective: Hospitalisation-associated disability (HAD, defined as the loss of ability to perform one or more basic activities of daily living [ADL] independently at discharge) is a frequent condition among older patients. The present study aimed to assess whether a simple inpatient exercise programme decreases the incidence of HAD in acutely hospitalised very old patients. 
Design: In this randomized controlled trial (Activity in GEriatric acute CARe, AGECAR) participants were assigned to a control or intervention (exercise) group, and were assessed at baseline, admission, discharge, and 3 months thereafter.
Setting and participants: 268 patients (mean age 88 years, range 75 to 102) admitted to an acute care for elders (ACE) unit of a Public Hospital were randomized to a control (n=125) or intervention (exercise) group (n=143). 
Methods: Both groups received usual care, and patients in the intervention group also performed simple supervised exercises (walking and rising from a chair, for a total daily duration of ~20 min). We measured incident HAD at discharge and after 3 months (primary outcome); and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), ambulatory capacity, number of falls, re-hospitalisation and death during a 3-month follow-up (secondary outcomes).  
Results: Median duration of hospitalisation was 7 days (interquartile range 4 days). Compared with admission, the intervention group had a lower risk of HAD at discharge (odds ratio [OR]: 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11, 0.92) and at 3-months follow-up (OR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.74) than controls during follow-up. No intervention effect was noted for the other secondary endpoints (all p>0.05), although a trend towards a lower mortality risk was observed in the intervention group (p=0.078). 
Conclusion and implications: These findings demonstrate that a simple inpatient exercise programme significantly decreases the risk of HAD in acutely hospitalised, very old patients.","/content/10.1101/19008151v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008151v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Geriatric Medicine

"Clinical Impact of Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing of Plasma Cell-Free DNA for the Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study","Background: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of plasma cell-free DNA has emerged as an attractive diagnostic modality allowing broad-range pathogen detection, noninvasive sampling, and earlier diagnosis. However, little is known about its real-world clinical impact as used in routine practice. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients for whom plasma mNGS (Karius test) was performed for all indications at 5 U.S. institutions over 1.5 years. Comprehensive chart review was performed, and standardized assessment of clinical impact of the mNGS based on the treating team interpretation of Karius results and patient management was established. Results: A total of 82 Karius tests were evaluated, from 39 (47.6%) adults and 43 (52.4%) children and a total of 53 (64.6%) immunocompromised patients. Karius positivity rate was 50/82 (61.0%), with 24 (48.0%) showing two or more organisms (range, 2-8). The Karius test results led to positive impact in 6 (7.3%), negative impact in 3 (3.7%), no impact in 70 (85.4%), and was indeterminate in 3 (3.7%). Cases with positive Karius result and clinical impact involved bacteria and/or fungi but not DNA viruses or parasites. In 10 patients who underwent 16 additional repeated tests, only one was associated with clinical impact. Conclusions: The real-world impact of the Karius test as currently used in routine clinical practice is limited. Further studies are needed to identify high-yield patient populations, define the complementary role of mNGS to conventional microbiological methods, and how best to integrate mNGS into current testing algorithms.","/content/10.1101/19008755v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008755v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Pathology

"Setting Standards to Promote Artificial Intelligence in Colon Mass Endoscopic Sampling","Artificial intelligence (AI) has undeniable values in detection, characterization, and monitoring of tumors during cancer imaging. However, major AI explorations in digestive endoscopy have not been systematically planned, and more important, most AI productions are based on Single-center Studies (ScSs). ScSs result in data scarcity, redundancy as well as island effects, which leads to some limitations in applying it on endoscopy. Current investigation aggregates a total of 2,500 gastroenteroscopy samples from various hospitals in multiple regions and carries out deep learning. It is found that factors inconducive to AI recognition are common such as: (a) the gastrointestinal tract is not cleaned up completely; (b) shooting angle (from left to right and the top of polyp are unexposed clearly), shooting distance (too close or too far to shoot causes the lump to be unclear), shooting light (insufficient light source or overexposed light source in mass) and unstable shooting lead to poor quality of pictures. We set standards based on the disadvantages of pictures which afterwards are uesd for AI robots and some improvements are found in the recognition accuracy. We set standards for a multicenter cooperation involving three-level medical institutions from the provincial, municipal and county to improve the recognition accuracy as well as the diagnosis and treatment efficiency meanwhile.","/content/10.1101/19008078v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008078v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Oncology

"Implementation of nursing process in Ethiopia and its association with working environment and knowledge: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Nursing Process is a scientific problem solving approach to direct nurses in caring for clients effectively and to improve quality of health care service. In Ethiopia the national pooled prevalence of implementation of nursing process remains unknown. Hence the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the level of implementation of nursing process and it association with knowledge and working environment.
Methods: PubMed Scopus Cochrane Library Google Scholar PsycINFO and CINAHL were systematically searched online to retrieve related articles. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed. To investigate heterogeneity across the included studies I2 test was employed. Publication bias was examined using funnel plot and Egger regression test statistic. The random-effect model was fitted to estimate the summary effects and odds ratios (ORs). All statistical analysis was done using STATA version 14 software for windows. 
Results: Seven studies which comprises of 1268 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The estimated pooled prevalence of implementation of nursing process in Ethiopia was 42.44% (95% CI (36.91-47.97%)). Based on the subgroup analysis the highest implementation of nursing process was observed sample size greater than or equals to two hundred 44.69% (95% CI: 35.34, 54.04). Nurses who have been work in the stressful environment [(OR 0.41  95%CI (0.08-2.12)] and having good knowledge about nursing process [(OR 2.44 95%CI (0.34,17.34)] was not significant associated with the implementation of nursing process. 
Conclusion: The overall implementation of nursing process in Ethiopia is relatively low. Nurses who have been work in the stressful environment have less likely implement nursing process. On the other hand Nurses who had good knowledge on nursing process were more likely to implement nursing process. Therefore, policymakers (FMOH) and other concerned body need give special attention to improve the implementation of nursing process.

"Not all animals are equal - farm living and allergy in Upper Bavaria","Background: A lower allergy and asthma prevalence in farm children has been described three decades ago in Switzerland. 
Objective: After years of research into bacterial exposure at farms, the origin of the farm effect is still unknown. We now hypothesize, that there is no such an effect in large industrial cattle farms with slatted floors indoors but in small farms only where animals are grazing outdoors and are having a higher endoparasite load.
Methods: We re-analyze an earlier epidemiological study by record-linkage to later agricultural surveys. The Asthma and Allergy Study in 1989/90 was a cross-sectional study of 1714 ten year old children in 63 villages covering ten different districts of Upper Bavaria. The farm effect is defined here as the association of number of cows per villager on lifetime prevalence of allergic rhinitis prevalence in the children of this village.
Results: The farm effect is restricted to small villages only. Furthermore, districts with higher Fasciola infection rates of cows, show a significant stronger farm effect than districts with lower infection rates.
Conclusion: The results warrant further research into human immune response to endoparasites in livestock.","/content/10.1101/19007864v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007864v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Allergy and Immunology

"Molecular Epidemiology, Diagnostics and Mechanisms of Antibiotic Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in Africa: A Systematic Review of Current Reports","Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a main global public health problem. However, a systematic review of TB resistance epidemiology in Africa is wanting. Methods: A comprehensive systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect for English research articles reporting on the molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex resistance in Africa from January 2007 to December 2018 was undertaken. Results and conclusion: Qualitative and quantitative synthesis were respectively undertaken with 232 and 186 included articles, representing 32 countries. TB monoresistance rate was highest for isoniazid (59%) and rifampicin (27%), particularly in Zimbabwe (100%), Swaziland (100%), and Sudan (67.9%) whilst multidrug resistance (MDR) rate was substantial in Zimbabwe (100%), Sudan (34.6%), Ivory Coast (24.5%) and Ethiopia (23.9%). Resistance-conferring mutations were commonly found in katG (n=3694), rpoB (n=3591), rrs (n=1272), inhA (n=1065), pncA (n=1063) and embB (n=705) in almost all included countries: S315G/I/N/R/T, V473D/F/G/I, Q471H/Q/R/Y, S303C/L etc. in katG; S531A/F/S/G, H526A/C/D/G, D516A/E/G etc. in rpoB; A1401G, A513C etc. in rrs; C15T, G17A/T, -A16G etc. in inhA; Ins456C, Ins 172G, L172P , C14R, Ins515G etc in pncA. Commonest lineages and families such as T (n=8139), LAM (n=5243), Beijing (n=5471), Cameroon (n=3315), CAS (n=2021), H (n=1773) etc., with the exception of T, were not fairly distributed; Beijing, Cameroon and CAS were prevalent in South Africa (n=4964), Ghana (n=2306), and Ethiopia/Tanzania (n=799/635) respectively. Resistance mutations were not lineage-specific and sputum (96.2%) were mainly used for diagnosing TB resistance using the LPA (38.5%), GeneXpert (17.2%), whole-genome sequencing (12.3%) and PCR/amplicon sequencing (9%/23%). Intercountry spread of strains were limited while intra-country dissemination was common. TB resistance and its diagnosis remain a major threat in Africa, necessitating urgent action to contain this global menace.","/content/10.1101/19008052v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008052v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Frontal and cerebellar atrophy supports FTLD-ALS clinical continuum and neuropsychology","Objective: Frontotemporal Lobe Degeneration (FTLD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases more often considered as a continuum from clinical, epidemiologic and genetic perspectives. We used localized brain atrophy to evaluate common and specific features of FTLD, FTLD-ALS and ALS patients to clarify this clinical continuum. 
Methods: We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) on structural MRI images to localize volume alterations of brain regions in group comparisons: patients (20 FTLD, 7 FTLD-ALS, 18 ALS) versus controls (39 CTR) and patient groups between themselves. We used whole-brain cortical thickness (CT) to assess correlations with brain volume to propose mechanistic explanations of the heterogeneous clinical presentations. We assessed whether brain atrophy can explain cognitive impairment, measured with neuropsychological tests (Frontal Assessment Battery, verbal fluency and semantic fluency).
Results: Common (mainly frontal) and specific areas of atrophy between FTLD, FTLD-ALS and ALS patients were detected, on the one hand confirming the suggestion of a clinical continuum, while on the other hand defining morphological specificities for each clinical group (e.g. a different cerebral and cerebellar involvement between FTLD and ALS). CT values suggested extensive network disruption in the pathological process, with indications of a correlation between white matter volume and CT in ALS. The correlation between neuropsychological scores pointed at an important role of the cerebellum, together with frontotemporal regions, in explaining cognitive impairment at the level of executive and linguistic functions. 
Conclusions: We identified common elements that explain the FTLD-ALS clinical continuum, while also identifying specificities of each group, partially explained by different cerebral and cerebellar involvement.","/content/10.1101/19007831v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007831v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Neurology

"Does e-cigarette use in non-smoking young adults act as a gateway to smoking? A systematic review and meta-analysis","Objective: There is evidence that e-cigarette use is less harmful than smoking, but there are also concerns that e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to smoking among young people. The aim of this review was to investigate whether e-cigarette use compared to non-use in young non-smokers is associated with subsequent cigarette smoking. 
Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis:
Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Wiley Cochrane Library databases, and the 2018 Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco and Society for Behavioural Medicine conference abstracts. 
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: All studies of young people (up to age 30 years) with a measure of e-cigarette use prior to smoking and an outcome measure of smoking where an odds ratio could be calculated were included (excluding reviews and animal studies). 
Results: Of 9,199 results, 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. There was strong evidence for an association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and later smoking (OR 4.59, 95% CI 3.60 to 5.85) when the results were meta-analysed in a random effects model. However, there was high heterogeneity (I2 = 88%). 
Conclusions: Whilst the association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and subsequent smoking appears strong, the available evidence is limited by the reliance on self-report measures of smoking history without biochemical verification. None of the studies included negative controls which would provide stronger evidence for whether the association may be causal. Much of the evidence also failed to consider the nicotine content of e-liquids used by non-smokers meaning it is difficult to make conclusions about whether nicotine is the mechanism driving this association.","/content/10.1101/19007005v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007005v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Epidemiology

"Incidence of Respiratory distress and its predictors among neonates admitted at neonatal intensive care unit, Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2019.","Background: Although Respiratory distress is one of the major causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality throughout the globe, it is a serious concern more of in resource limited nations, like Ethiopia. Besides, few studies are available in developing countries. Data from different settings is needed to tackle it. Therefore, we intended to assess the incidence and predictors of respiratory distress among neonates who were admitted in neonatal Intensive care unit (NICU) at Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia.
 Methods: Institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 571 neonates from January 2013 to March 2018. Data were collected by reviewing patients chart using systematic sampling technique with a pretested checklist; entered using Epi-data 4.2 and analyzed with STATA 14. Median time, Kaplan-Meier survival estimation curve and Log-rank test were computed. Bivariable and multivariable Gompertz parametric hazards models were fitted to detect the determinant of respiratory distress. Hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval was calculated. Variables with reported p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results: The proportion of respiratory distress among of neonates admitted in Black Lion specialized hospital neonatal intensive care unit was 42.9 % (95%CI: 39.3-46.1%) with incidence of 8.1/100(95%CI: 7.3, 8.9)).Being male [AHR=2.4 (95%CI:1.1,3.1)], neonates born via caesarean section  [AHR:1,.9((95%CI:1.6,2.3)], home delivery  [AHR :2.9 (95%CI:1.5, 5,2)], maternal diabetes mellitus [AHR 2.3(95%CI: 1.4 ,3.6)], preterm birth  [AHR:2.9(95%CI:1.6, 5.1)] and APGAR score less than 7  [AHR: 3.1 (95%CI:1.8,5.0)] were found to be significant predictors of respiratory distress.
Conclusions: The incidence of respiratory distress among neonates was found to be high. Those neonates delivered at home, delivered through caesarean section, preterm neonates, whose APGAR score<7, and born from diabetic mothers were more likely to develop respiratory distress.  All concerned bodies should work on preventing RD and give special attention for multifactorial cause of it .Thus; it is indicated to promote health institutional delivery more. Besides, a need to establish and/or strengthen strategies to prevent the occurrence of respiratory distress among babies with low APGAR score, preterm babies, born from diabetes mellitus mothers, and delivered through caesarean section.","/content/10.1101/19007823v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007823v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Pediatrics

"Autoantibodies against the prion protein in individuals with PRNP mutations","Objective. To determine whether naturally occurring autoantibodies against the prion protein are present in individuals with genetic prion disease mutations and controls, and if so, whether they are protective against prion disease. 
Methods. In this case-control study, we collected 124 blood samples from individuals with a variety of pathogenic PRNP mutations and 78 control individuals with a positive family history of genetic prion disease but lacking disease-associated PRNP mutations. Antibody reactivity was measured using an indirect ELISA for the detection of human IgG1-4 antibodies against wild-type human prion protein. Multivariate linear regression models were constructed to analyze differences in autoantibody reactivity between a) PRNP mutation carriers versus controls and b) asymptomatic versus symptomatic PRNP mutation carriers. Robustness of results was examined in matched cohorts.
Results. We found that antibody reactivity was present in a subset of both PRNP mutation carriers and controls. Autoantibody levels were not influenced by PRNP mutation status nor clinical manifestation of prion disease. Post hoc analyses showed anti-PrPC autoantibody titers to be independent of personal history of autoimmune disease and other immunological disorders, as well as PRNP codon 129 polymorphism. 
Conclusions. Pathogenic PRNP variants do not notably stimulate antibody-mediated anti-PrPC immunity. Anti-PrPC IgG autoantibodies are not associated with the onset of prion disease. The presence of anti-PrPC autoantibodies in the general population without any disease-specific association suggests that relatively high titers of naturally occurring antibodies are well tolerated.

"Epidemiology and predictors of repeat positive chlamydia tests: the Brant County cohort, Ontario, Canada","Objectives: Repeat positive tests for chlamydia (CR) may help explain current high rates of chlamydia despite years of screening, partner notification and treatment to reduce sequelae.  We wanted to determine the numbers of CRs over time as a proportion of all chlamydia cases, and define the differences in demographic, clinical, behavioural, and public health management indicators, between individuals who have experienced a CR and individuals who experienced a single infection in Brant County, Ontario.
Methods: A retrospective cohort was developed using notifiable disease data extracted from the integrated public health system. Cases were laboratory confirmed chlamydia and gonorrhea infections in Brant County between January 1st, 2006 and December 31st, 2015. During the study period, 3,499 chlamydia cases and 475 gonorrhea cases were diagnosed. The total number of individuals with chlamydia in that period was 3,060, including 157 coinfections with gonorrhea. Differences between those with reinfection and those with single infection were evaluated using univariate and multivariate (Cox proportional hazards model) methods.
Results: Four hundred and ninety-nine (16.30%) individuals experienced CR 28 days from initial infection; of which 328 (65.73%) occurred within 2 years and 211 (42.28%) within 1 year. The median time to CR was 276 days, consistent with existing Canadian literature. Independent risk factors for CR included being male, 25 years old or younger, and not receiving recommended treatment for initial and/or subsequent infection. 
Conclusions: These findings suggest that inadequate treatment play a significant role in CR, while accounting for young age and male gender, likely due to untreated sex partners.","/content/10.1101/19007278v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007278v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Problematic Internet Use in Children and Adolescents: Associations with psychiatric disorders and impairment","Objective: Here, we leveraged the ongoing, large-scale Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network, a transdiagnostic self-referred, community sample of children and adolescents (ages 5-21), to examine the associations between Problematic Internet Use (PIU) and psychopathology, general impairment, physical health and sleep disturbances. Methods: A total sample of 564 (190 female) participants between the ages of 7-15 (mean = 10.80, SD = 2.16), along with their parents/guardians, completed diagnostic interviews with clinicians, answered a myriad of self-report questionnaires, and underwent physical testing as part of the Healthy Brain Network protocol. Results: PIU was positively associated with depressive disorders (aOR = 2.34; CI: 1.18-4.56; p = .01), the combined subtype of ADHD (aOR = 1.79; CI: 1.08-2.98; p = .02), greater levels of impairment (Standardized Beta = 4.79; CI: 3.21-6.37; p < .01) and increased sleep disturbances (Standardized Beta = 3.01; CI: 0.58-5.45; p = .02), even when accounting for demographic covariates and psychiatric comorbidity. Conclusion: The association between PIU and psychopathology, as well as its impact on impairment and sleep disturbances, highlight the urgent need to gain an understanding of mechanisms in order to inform public health recommendations on internet use in U.S. youth.","/content/10.1101/19005967v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005967v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Computer-assisted craniometric evaluation for diagnosis and follow-up of craniofacial asymmetries: SymMetric v. 1.0","Purpose: The current assessment of patients with craniofacial asymmetries is accomplished by physical examination, anamnesis and radiological imaging. 
We propose a semi-automated, computer-assisted craniofacial evaluation (SymMetric v 1.0) based on orthogonal photography of the patient's head in 3 positions. The system is simple, low-cost, no-radiation or special resources needed. Although it does not substitute CT in cases of doubt between craniosynostosis and positional plagiocephaly, multiple numeric evaluations indicate regional deformities and severity of the asymmetry, which can help in the clinical decision of indicating or not the orthosis in positional deformities, determining treatment duration or evaluating surgical outcomes after correction. 
Methods: A Matlab-based tool was developed for digital processing of photographs taken in 3 positions (anterior, superior and lateral). The software guides the user to select visible and reproducible landmarks in each photograph acquisition and calculates multiple indexes and metrics, generating a set of comprehensive plots to offer the user an overview of head and facial symmetry across the orthogonal views. For purposes of demonstration, we evaluated 2 patients (one control and one with non-sinostotic deformity). 
Results: The results show a clear differentiation of the control and plagiocephalic patient metrics mainly in the superior view, showing potential for diagnosis of the condition, and also detected the clinical improvement during helmet treatment in the follow-up, 3 and 5 months after orthosis use.
Conclusion: We presented a proof-of-concept for a low cost, no radiation evaluation system for craniofacial asymmetries, that can be useful in a clinical context for diagnosis and follow-up of patients.","/content/10.1101/19007054v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007054v1.full.pdf","2019-10-06","Pediatrics

"A conceptual model for pluralistic healthcare behavior: results from a qualitative study in southwestern Uganda","Introduction:  Medical pluralism, or concurrent utilization of multiple therapeutic modalities, is common in various international contexts, and has been characterized as a factor contributing to poor health outcomes in low-resource settings. Traditional healers are ubiquitous providers in most regions, including the study site of southwestern Uganda. It is not well understood why patients in pluralistic settings continue to engage with both therapeutic healthcare modalities, rather than simply selecting one or the other. The goal of this study was to identify factors that motivate pluralistic healthcare utilization, and create a general, conceptual framework of pluralistic health behavior. 

Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted between September 2017 and February 2018 with patients seeking care at traditional healers (N=30) and at an outpatient medicine clinic (N=30) in Mbarara, Uganda; the study is nested within a longitudinal project examining HIV testing engagement among traditional healer-utilizing communities. Inclusion criteria included age 18 years or older, and ability to provide informed consent. Participants were recruited from healer practices representing the range of healer specialties. Following an inductive approach, interview transcripts were reviewed and coded to identify conceptual categories explaining healthcare utilization.  

Results: We identified three broad categories relevant to healthcare utilization among study participants: 1) traditional healers treat patients with â€œcareâ€; 2) biomedicine uses â€œmodernâ€ technologies; and 3) peer â€œtestimonyâ€ influences healthcare engagement. These categories describe variables at the healthcare provider, healthcare system, and peer levels that interrelate to motivate individual engagement in pluralistic health resources. 

Conclusions: Patients perceive clear advantages and disadvantages to biomedical and traditional care in medically pluralistic settings. We identified factors at the healthcare provider, healthcare system, and peer levels which influence patients' therapeutic itineraries. Our findings provide a basis to improve health outcomes in medically pluralistic settings, and underscore the importance of recognizing traditional healers as important stakeholders in community health.","/content/10.1101/19008508v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008508v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Public and Global Health

"Traditional Healers as Client Advocates in the HIV-endemic Region of Maputo, Mozambique: Results from a qualitative study","Traditional healers are commonly utilized throughout sub-Saharan Africa instead of, and in concert with, biomedical facilities. Traditional healers are trusted providers and prominent community members, and could be important partners in improving engagement with HIV services in endemic contexts. Our study sought to understand the roles of healers in the urban setting of Maputo, Mozambique, where HIV prevalence is high and testing rates are low. Qualitative data were gathered through minimally-structured interviews with 36 healers. Analysis followed an inductive, grounded theory approach. Data reveal three themes relevant to improving engagement with HIV services in this endemic region: 1) healers have positive attitudes towards biomedicine; 2) healers advocate for their sick clients; and 3) clients are reticent to present to biomedical facilities. Healers describe their roles as ""cooperative"" with biomedical providers to provide healthcare for their clients. Results suggest that healers could be considered critical enablers to effective HIV programs in communities. They have social and symbolic capital that positions them to beneficially influence clients, and are natural partners for interventions to improve uptake of HIV services.","/content/10.1101/19008490v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008490v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","HIV/AIDS

"Quantifying the success of measles vaccination campaigns in the Rohingya refugee camps","In the wake of the Rohingya population's mass migration from Myanmar, one of the world's largest refugee settlements was constructed in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh to accommodate nearly 900,000 new refugees. Refugee populations are particularly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks due to many population and environmental factors. A large measles outbreak, with over 2,500 cases, occurred among the Rohingya population between September and December 2017. Here, we estimate key epidemiological parameters and use a dynamic mathematical model of measles transmission to evaluate the effectiveness of the reactive vaccination campaigns in the refugee camps. We also estimate the potential for subsequent outbreaks under different vaccination coverage scenarios. Our modeling results highlight the success of the vaccination campaigns in rapidly curbing transmission and emphasize the public health importance of maintaining high levels of vaccination in this population, where high birth rates and historically low vaccination coverage rates create suitable conditions for future measles outbreaks.","/content/10.1101/19008417v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008417v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Epidemiology

"Forecasting Seizure Risk over Days","For persons with epilepsy, much suffering stems from the apparent unpredictability of seizures. Historically, efforts to predict seizures have sought to detect changes in brain activity in the seconds to minutes preceding seizures (pre-ictal period), a timeframe that limits preventative interventions. Recently, converging evidence from studies using chronic intracranial electroencephalography revealed that brain activity in epilepsy has a robust cyclical structure over hours (circadian) and days (multidien). These cycles organize pro-ictal states, hours- to days-long periods of heightened seizure risk, raising the possibility of forecasting seizures over horizons longer than the pre-ictal period. Here, using cEEG from 18 subjects, we developed point-process generalized linear models incorporating cyclical variables at multiple time-scales to show that seizure risk can be forecasted accurately over days in most subjects. Personalized risk-stratification days in advance of seizures is unprecedented and may enable novel preventative strategies.","/content/10.1101/19008086v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008086v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Neurology

"Can the impact of childhood adiposity on disease risk be reversed? A Mendelian randomization study","Objective: To evaluate whether early life adiposity has an independent effect on later life disease risk or whether its influence is mediated by adulthood body mass index (BMI). 
Design: Two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization.
Setting: The UK Biobank (UKB) prospective cohort study and four large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) consortia.
Participants: 453,169 participants enrolled in the UKB and a combined total of over 700,000 individuals from different GWAS consortia.
Exposures: Measured BMI during adulthood (mean age: 56.5) and self-reported adiposity at age 10.
Main outcome measures: Coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), breast cancer and prostate cancer.
Results: Individuals with genetically predicted higher BMI in early life had increased odds of CAD (OR:1.49, 95% CI:1.33-1.68) and T2D (OR:2.32, 95% CI:1.76-3.05) based on univariable MR (UVMR) analyses. However, there was little evidence of a direct effect (i.e. not via adult BMI) based on multivariable MR (MVMR) estimates (CAD OR:1.02, 95% CI:0.86-1.22, T2D OR:1.16, 95% CI:0.74-1.82). In the MVMR analysis of breast cancer risk, there was strong evidence of a protective direct effect for early BMI (OR:0.59, 95% CI:0.50-0.71), although adult BMI did not appear to have a direct effect on this outcome (OR:1.08, 95% CI:0.93-1.27). Adding age of menarche as an additional exposure provided weak evidence of a total causal effect (UVMR OR:0.98, 95% CI:0.91-1.06) but strong evidence of a direct causal effect, independent of early and adult BMI (MVMR OR:0.90, 95% CI:0.85-0.95). Weak evidence of a causal effect was observed in the MVMR analysis of prostate cancer (early life BMI OR:1.06, 95% CI:0.81-1.40, adult BMI OR:0.87, 95% CI:0.70-1.08).
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that increased CAD and T2D risk attributed to early life adiposity can be mitigated if individuals reduce their weight in later life. However, having a low BMI during childhood may increase risk of breast cancer regardless of changes to weight in later life, with timing of puberty also putatively playing an important role.","/content/10.1101/19008011v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008011v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Epidemiology

"Potential impact of outpatient stewardship interventions on antibiotic exposures of bacterial pathogens","The relationship between antibiotic stewardship and population levels of antibiotic resistance remains unclear. In order to better understand changes in selective pressure due to stewardship, we use publicly available data to estimate the effect of changes in prescribing on exposures to frequently used antibiotics experienced by potentially pathogenic bacteria that are asymptomatically colonizing the microbiome. We quantify this impact under four hypothetical stewardship strategies. In one scenario, we estimate that elimination of all unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use could avert 6 to 48% (IQR: 17 to 31%) of exposures across pairwise combinations of sixteen common antibiotics and nine bacterial pathogens. Across all scenarios, we find that successful stewardship interventions, facilitated by changes in clinician behavior and improved diagnostics, have the opportunity to substantially reduce exposures across a wide range of antibiotic-organism combinations. Concurrent approaches, such as vaccines aiming to reduce infection incidence, are needed to decrease exposures occurring in 'necessary' contexts.","/content/10.1101/19008029v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008029v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"PROBLEM BASED LEARNING APPLIED TO PRACTICE IN BRAZILIANS MEDICAL SCHOOL: A MINI SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","Background
Active learning is a well-established educational methodology in medical school worldwide. Although its implementation in Brazilian clinical settings is quite challenging. The objective of this study is to review the literature in a systematic manner to find and conduct a reflective analysis of how PBL has been applied in clinical teaching in Brazilian medicine schools.
Material & methods
A systematic literature search was conducted in three databases. A total of  250 papers related to PBL in Brazilian medical school were identified thought the databases search. Four studies were finally selected for the review. 
Results
Four fields of medicine were explored on the four selected papers: gynecology/family medicine, medical semiology, psychiatry, and pediatrics.  Overall, all the papers reported some level of strategic adaptability of the original PBL methodology to better applied in the Brazilian medical schools curricula and country peculiar characteristics. 
Conclusion
PBL application in Brazilian medical school suffers some level of alteration from the original format, to better adapted to the peculiarities of Brazilian students maturity, health system priorities and medical labor market.","/content/10.1101/19007955v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007955v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Medical Education

"Safety of Flexible Sigmoidoscopy in Pregnant Patients with known or suspected Inflammatory Bowel Disease","I.	Background and Aims
Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis and staging of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). However, there is limited safety data in pregnant populations, resulting in conservative society guidelines and practice patterns favoring diagnostic delay. The aim of this study is to investigate if the performance of flexible sigmoidoscopy is associated with adverse events in pregnant patients with known or suspected IBD.

II.	Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) between April 2008 and April 2019. Female patients aged between 18 and 48 years who were pregnant at the time of endoscopy were identified. All patient records were reviewed to determine disease, pregnancy course, and lifestyle factors. Two independent reviewers performed the data abstraction. Adverse events were assessed for temporal relation (defined as within 4 weeks) with endoscopy. Any discrepancies in the two reviewers' data were reviewed by a third independent investigator. Descriptive statistics of data were calculated, and comparison of continuous and categorical data were made using a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test, respectively. 

III.	Results
We report the outcomes of 48 pregnant patients across all trimesters who underwent lower endoscopy for suspected or established IBD. There were no hospitalizations or adverse obstetric events temporally associated with sigmoidoscopy. 78% of patients experienced a change in treatment following sigmoidoscopy. 12% of the patients with known IBD were found to have no endoscopic evidence of disease activity despite symptoms.

IV.	Conclusions 
Lower endoscopy in the pregnant patient with known or suspected IBD is low risk and affects therapeutic decision making. It should not be delayed in patients with appropriate indications.","/content/10.1101/19007997v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007997v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Gastroenterology

"Systematic review and network meta-analysis with individual participant data on Cord Management at Preterm Birth (iCOMP): study protocol","Introduction: Timing of cord clamping and other cord management strategies may improve outcomes at preterm birth. However, it is unclear whether benefits apply to all preterm subgroups such as those who usually receive immediate neonatal care. Previous and current trials compare various policies, including immediate cord clamping, time- or physiology-based deferred cord clamping, and cord milking. Individual participant data (IPD) enables exploration of different strategies within subgroups. Network meta-analysis (NMA) enables comparison and ranking of all available interventions using a combination of direct and indirect comparisons.
Objectives: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of cord management strategies for preterm infants on neonatal mortality and morbidity overall and for different participant characteristics using IPD meta-analysis; and 2) to evaluate and rank the effect of different cord management strategies for preterm births on mortality and other key outcomes using NMA.
Methods and analysis: We will conduct a systematic search of Medline, Embase, clinical trial registries, and other sources for all planned, ongoing and completed randomised controlled trials comparing alternative cord management strategies at preterm birth (before 37 weeks' gestation). IPD will be sought for all trials. First, deferred clamping and cord milking will be compared with immediate clamping in pairwise IPD meta-analyses. The primary outcome will be death prior to hospital discharge. Effect differences will be explored for pre-specified subgroups of participants. Second, all identified cord management strategies will be compared and ranked in an IPD NMA for the primary outcome and the key secondary outcomes intraventricular haemorrhage (any grade) and infant blood transfusions (any). Treatment effect differences by participant characteristics will be identified. Inconsistency and heterogeneity will be explored.
Ethics and dissemination: Approved by University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (2018/886). Results will be relevant to clinicians, guideline-developers and policy-makers, and will be disseminated via publications, presentations, and media releases.","/content/10.1101/19007708v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007708v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Obstetrics and Gynecology

"Mathematical modeling of directed acyclic graphs to explore competing causal mechanisms underlying epidemiological study data","Accurately estimating the effect of an exposure on an outcome requires understanding how variables relevant to a study question are causally related to each other. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are used in epidemiology to understand causal processes and determine appropriate statistical approaches to obtain unbiased measures of effect. Compartmental models (CMs) are also used to represent different causal mechanisms, by depicting flows between disease states on the population level. In this paper, we extend a mapping between DAGs and CMs to show how DAG-derived CMs can be used to compare competing causal mechanisms by simulating epidemiological studies and conducting statistical analyses on the simulated data. Through this framework, we can evaluate how robust simulated epidemiological study results are to different biases in study design and underlying causal mechanisms. As a case study, we simulated a longitudinal cohort study to examine the obesity paradox: the apparent protective effect of obesity on mortality among diabetic ever-smokers, but not among diabetic never-smokers. Our simulations illustrate how study design bias (e.g., reverse causation), can lead to the obesity paradox. Ultimately, we show the utility of transforming DAGs into in silico laboratories within which researchers can systematically evaluate bias, and inform analyses and study design.","/content/10.1101/19007922v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007922v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Epidemiology

"PERIPHERAL BLOOD AS TOOL TO DETERMINE GENE EXPRESSION PATTERNS IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHIATRIC, NEUROLOGICAL AND OTHER COMMON DISORDERS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS PROTOCOL","Introduction:  Common diseases are influenced by a variety of factors that can enhance one person's susceptibility to developing a specific condition. Complex traits have been investigated in several biological levels. One that reflects the high interconnectivity and interaction of genes, proteins and transcription factors is the transcriptome. In this study, we disclose the protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming at summarizing the available evidence regarding transcriptomic gene expression levels of peripheral blood samples comparing subjects with psychiatric, neurological and other common disorders to healthy controls.
Methods and analysis:  The investigation of the transcriptomic levels in the peripheral blood enables the unique opportunity to unravel the etiology of common diseases in patients  ex-vivo.  However, the experimental results should be minimally consistent across studies for them to be considered as the best approximation of the true effect. In order to test this, we will systematically identify all transcriptome studies that compared subjects with common disorders to their respective control samples. We will apply meta-analyses to assess the overall differentially expressed genes throughout the studies of each condition.
Ethics and dissemination:  The data that will be used to conduct this study are available online and have already been published following their own ethical laws. Therefore this study requires no further ethical approval. The results of this study will be published in
leading peer-reviewed journals of the area and also presented at relevant national and international conferences.","/content/10.1101/19007633v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007633v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"A machine learning approach for precision diagnosis of juvenile-onset SLE","Juvenile-Onset systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease characterised by systemic inflammation and organ damage, with disease onset often coinciding with puberty. JSLE is associated with more severe disease manifestations and a higher motility rate compared to adult SLE. Due to the heterogeneous clinical and immunological manifestations of JSLE, delayed diagnosis and poor treatment efficacy are major barriers for improving patient outcome. In order to define a unique immunophenotyping profile distinguishing JSLE patients from age matched healthy controls, immune-based machine learning (ML) approaches were applied. Balanced random forest analysis discriminated JSLE patients from healthy controls with an overall 91% prediction accuracy. The top-ranked immunological features were selected from the optimal ML model and were validated by partial least squares discriminant analysis and logistic regression analysis. Patients could be clustered into four distinct groups based on the top hits from the ML model, providing an opportunity for tailored therapy. Moreover, complex correlations between the JSLE immune profile and clinical features of disease were identified. Further immunological association studies are essential for developing data-driven personalised medicine approaches to aid diagnosis of JSLE for targeted therapy and improved patient outcomes.","/content/10.1101/19007765v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007765v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Rheumatology

As a first step in developing such a tool, we used a large-scale dataset from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), to examine the performance of a well-known adult diabetes risk self-assessment screener and published pediatric clinical screening guidelines in identifying youth with pre-diabetes/diabetes (pre-DM/DM) based on American Diabetes Association diagnostic biomarkers. We assessed the agreement between the adult screener/pediatric screening guidelines and biomarker diagnostic criteria by conducting comparisons using the overall data set and sub-datasets stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, and age. While the pediatric guidelines performed better than the adult screener in identifying youth with pre-DM/DM (sensitivity 43.1% vs 7.2%), both are inadequate for general deployment among youth. There were also notable differences in the performance of the pediatric guidelines across subgroups based on age, sex and race/ethnicity. In an effort to improve pre-DM/DM screening, we also evaluated data-driven machine learning-based classification algorithms, several of which performed slightly but statistically significantly better than the pediatric screening guidelines.","/content/10.1101/19007872v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007872v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Pediatrics

"Measuring Total Healthcare Utilization Among Intimate Partner Violence Survivors In Primary Care","Rising health care costs are influenced by health care utilization, which encompasses hospital, ambulatory and non-face-to-face episodes of care. In this study, we created a novel a health care utilization-scoring tool that was used to examine whether one psychosocial factor, intimate partner violence (IPV), leads to higher utilization of health care services when controlling for relevant confounders. We sought to fill gaps about how social and behavioral issues impact utilization, particularly non-face-to-face episodes of care.

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study in 2017 examining patients seen at 11 University-affiliated primary care clinics from January 2015 to December 2016 who were screened for IPV. A total of 31,305 patients were screened, of which 280 screened positive. We controlled for medical complexity by deriving the revised Charlson Comorbidity Index for each patient. We calculated a novel utilization score, which was a weighted sum of hospital, ambulatory and non-face-to-face encounters. Missed appointments were also measured.

IPV-positive and IPV-negative patients were similar with respect medical complexity. IPV-positive patients had significantly higher mean utilization scores (54 vs. 40, p<0.001) and more missed appointments (3 vs. 1.3, p<0.001). IPV was associated with increased total utilization (p=0.015), as well as non-face-to-face and ambulatory visits (p=0.025 and p=0.015, respectively) for female patients and was associated with more missed appointments for both males and females (p<.001).

These data support more inclusive population-specific interventions focusing on social determinants of health to reduce both face-to-face and non-face-to-face utilization, which may improve health care expenditures, outcomes and provider satisfaction.","/content/10.1101/19007377v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007377v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Primary Care Research

"A validation of machine learning-based risk scores in the prehospital setting","Background: The triage of patients in pre-hospital care is a difficult task, and improved risk assessment tools are needed both at the dispatch center and on the ambulance to differentiate between low- and high-risk patients. This study develops and validates a machine learning-based approach to predicting hospital outcomes based on routinely collected prehospital data.
Methods: Dispatch, ambulance, and hospital data were collected in one Swedish region from 2016 to 2017. Dispatch center and ambulance records were used to develop gradient boosting models predicting hospital admission, critical care (defined as admission to an intensive care unit or in-hospital mortality), and two-day mortality. Model predictions were used to generate composite risk scores which were compared to National Early Warning System (NEWS) scores and actual dispatched priorities in a similar but prospectively gathered dataset from 2018.
Results: A total of 38203 patients were included from 2016-2018. Concordance indexes (or area under the receiver operating characteristics curve) for dispatched priorities ranged from 0.51 to 0.66, while those for NEWS scores ranged from 0.66 to 0.85. Concordance ranged from 0.71 to 0.80 for risk scores based only on dispatch data, and 0.79 to 0.89 for risk scores including ambulance data. Dispatch data-based risk scores consistently outperformed dispatched priorities in predicting hospital outcomes, while models including ambulance data also consistently outperformed NEWS scores. Model performance in the prospective test dataset was similar to that found using cross-validation, and calibration was comparable to that of NEWS scores.","/content/10.1101/19007021v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007021v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Emergency Medicine

"A method for complete characterization of complex germline rearrangements from long DNA reads","Many genetic/genomic disorders are caused by genomic rearrangements. Standard methods can often characterize these variations only partly, e.g. copy number changes. We describe full characterization of complex chromosomal rearrangements, based on whole-genome-coverage sequencing of long DNA reads from four patients with chromosomal translocations. We developed a new analysis pipeline, which filters out rearrangements seen in humans without the same disease, reducing the number of loci per patient from a few thousand to a few dozen. For one patient with two reciprocal chromosomal translocations, we find that the translocation points have complex rearrangements of multiple DNA fragments involving 5 chromosomes, which we could order and orient by an automatic algorithm, thereby fully reconstructing the rearrangement. Some important properties of these rearrangements, such as sequence loss, are holistic: they cannot be inferred from any part of the rearrangement, but only from the fully-reconstructed rearrangement. In this patient, the rearrangements were evidently caused by shattering of the chromosomes into multiple fragments, which rejoined in a different order and orientation with loss of some fragments. Our approach promises to fully characterize many congenital germline rearrangement, provided they do not involve poorly-understood loci such as centromeric repeats.","/content/10.1101/19006379v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006379v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Postgraduate education among family and community physicians in Brazil: the TrajetÃ³rias MFC project","Neither primary health care or family and community medicine are recognized as knowledge areas in Brazil, for the purpose of postgraduate education (master's, Ph.D.) or research. Our objective was to describe the postgraduate education trajectories of family and community physicians in Brazil. In this observational, exploratory study, we used data from SBMFC and SisCNRM to compile the list of physicians and community physicians, and then downloaded their curricula vitae from the Lattes Platform, verifying all data for consistency. A master's degree was held by one in eight, and a Ph.D., by one in forty; most degrees were in collective health. Women (versus men) were less likely to hold master's degrees, and even less likely to hold Ph.D. degrees. Professional (versus academic) master's degrees and those in other areas (versus in medicine or collective health) were also associated with lower probability of obtaining a Ph.D. degree. Certified specialists (versus those with a medical residency) with a postgraduate degree were more likely to have earned it before becoming family and community physicians. We suggest that researchers in public health critically examine the relative benefits of different postgraduate trajectories for the professional performance of family and community physicians.","/content/10.1101/19005744v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005744v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Medical Education

"Methodology for tDCS integration with fMRI","Integration of tDCS with fMRI holds promise for investigation the underlying mechanism of stimulation effect. There are 118 published tDCS studies (up to 1st Oct 2018) that used fMRI as a proxy measure of neural activation to answer mechanistic, predictive, and localization questions about how brain activity is modulated by tDCS. FMRI can potentially contribute as: a measure of cognitive state-level variance in baseline brain activation before tDCS; inform the design of stimulation montages that aim to target functional networks during specific tasks; and act as an outcome measure of functional response to tDCS. In this systematic review we explore methodological parameter space of tDCS integration with fMRI. Existing tDCS-fMRI literature shows little replication across these permutations; few studies used comparable study designs. Here, we use a case study with both task and resting state fMRI before and after tDCS in a cross-over design to discuss methodological confounds. We further outline how computational models of current flow should be combined with imaging data to understand sources of variability in responsiveness. Through the case study, we demonstrate how modeling and imaging methodology can be integrated for individualized analysis. Finally, we discuss the importance of conducting tDCS-fMRI with stimulation equipment certified as safe to use inside the MR scanner, and of correcting for image artifacts caused by tDCS. tDCS-fMRI can address important questions on the functional mechanisms of tDCS action (e.g. target engagement) and has the potential to support enhancement of behavioral interventions, provided studies are designed rationally.","/content/10.1101/19006288v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006288v1.full.pdf","2019-10-03","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Science map of Cochrane systematic reviews receiving the most altmetric attention: network visualization and machine learning perspective","Introduction: We aim to visualize and analyze the science map of Cochrane systematic reviews with the high altmetric attention scores. Methods: On 10 May 2019, altmetric data of Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews obtained from Altmetric database (Altmetric LLP, London, UK). Bibliometric data of top 5% Cochrane systematic reviews further extracted from Web of Science. keyword co-occurrence, co-authorship and co-citation network visualization were then employed using VOSviewer software. Decision tree and random forest model were used to analyze citations pattern. Results: 12016 Cochrane systematic reviews with Altmetric attention are found (total mentions=259,968). Twitter was the most popular altmetric resource among these articles. Consequently, the top 5% (607 articles, mean altmetric score= 171.2, Confidence Level (CL) 95%= 14.4, mean citations= 42.1, CL 95%= 1.3) with the highest Altmetric score are included in the study. Keyword co-occurrence network visualization showed female, adult and child as the most accurate keywords respectively. At author level, Helen V Worthington had the greatest impact on the network. At organization and country levels, University of Oxford and U.K had the greatest impact on the network in turn. Co-citation network analysis showed that Lancet and Cochrane database of systematic reviews had the most influence on the network. However, altmetric score do not correlate with citations (r=0.15) (Figure 7), it does correlate with policy document mentions (r=0.61). Results of decision tree and random forest model (a machine learning algorithm) confirmed importance of policy document mentions. Discussion: Despite popularity of Cochrane systematic reviews in Twittersphere, disappointingly, they rarely shared and discussed in newly emerging academic tools (e.g. F1000 prime, Publons and PubPeer). Overall, Wikipedia mentions were low among Cochrane systematic reviews, considering the established partnership between Wikipedia and Cochrane collaboration. Newly emerging and groundbreaking concepts, e.g. genomic medicine, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence not that admired among hot topics.

"MicroRNA-mRNA networks define translatable molecular outcome phenotypes in osteosarcoma.","Background: There is a lack of well validated biomarkers in osteosarcoma, a rare, recalcitrant disease with variable outcome and poorly understood biologic behavior, for which treatment standards have stalled for decades. The only standard prognostic factor in osteosarcoma remains the amount of pathologic necrosis following pre-operative chemotherapy, which does not adequately capture the biologic complexity of the tumor and has not resulted in optimized patient therapeutic stratification. New, robust biomarkers are needed to understand prognosis and better reflect the underlying biologic and molecular complexity of this disease. 

Methods: We performed microRNA sequencing in 74 frozen osteosarcoma biopsy samples, the largest single center translationally analyzed cohort to date, and separately analyzed a multi-omic dataset from a large (n = 95) NCI supported national cooperative group cohort. Molecular patterns were tested for association with outcome and used to identify novel therapeutics for further study by integrative pharmacogenomic analysis. 

Results: MicroRNA profiles were found predict Recurrence Free Survival (5-microRNA profile, Median RFS 59 vs 202 months, log rank p=0.06, HR 1.87, 95% CI 0.96-3.66). The profiles were independently prognostic of RFS when controlled for metastatic disease at diagnosis and pathologic necrosis following chemotherapy in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression (5-microRNA profile, HR 3.31, 95% CI 1.31-8.36, p=0.01). Strong trends for survival discrimination were observed in the independent NCI dataset, and transcriptomic analysis revealed the downstream microRNA regulatory targets are also predictive of survival (median RFS 17 vs 105 months, log rank p=0.007). Additionally, DNA methylation patterns held prognostic significance. Through machine learning based integrative pharmacogenomic analysis, the microRNA biomarkers identify novel therapeutics for further study and stratified application in osteosarcoma.

Conclusions: Our results support the existence of molecularly defined phenotypes in osteosarcoma associated with distinct outcome independent of clinicopathologic features. We validated candidate microRNA profiles and their associated molecular networks for prognostic value in multiple independent datasets. These networks may define previously unrecognized osteosarcoma subtypes with distinct molecular context and clinical course potentially appropriate for future application of tailored treatment strategies in different patient subgroups.","/content/10.1101/19007740v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007740v1.full.pdf","2019-10-03","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Treatment advantage in HBV/HIV coinfection compared to HBV monoinfection in a South African cohort","Objective: Prompted by international targets for elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, we set out to study adults with chronic HBV (CHB) infection in South Africa. We sought to characterise individuals with HBV monoinfection vs. those coinfected with HBV/HIV, to evaluate the impact of therapy and to guide improvements in clinical care as guidelines for antiviral therapy change over time. 
Design: We prospectively recruited 112 adults with CHB, of whom 38 (34%) had HIV coinfection, over one year in a university hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. We recorded cross-sectional demographic, clinical and laboratory data.
Results: Adults with HBV monoinfection were comparable to those with HBV/HIV coinfection in terms of age, sex and body mass. HBeAg-positive status was more common among those with coinfection (p=0.01). Compared to HBV/HIV coinfection, HBV monoinfected patients were less likely to be on antiviral treatment and less likely to have been assessed by fibroscan (p<0.0001 in each case); they were also more likely to have detectable HBV viraemia (p=0.01), moderate/severe thrombocytopaenia (p=0.007), elevated bilirubin (p=0.002), and APRI score >2 (p=0.02), suggesting underlying liver disease. Three cases of hepatocellular carcinoma were reported, all in patients with HBV monoinfection. 
Conclusion: Individuals with HBV monoinfection are disadvantaged in terms of clinical assessment and appropriate antiviral therapy compared to those with HIV coinfection, associated with relatively worse liver health. Enhanced advocacy, education, resources and infrastructure are required to optimise interventions for CHB.","/content/10.1101/19007963v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007963v1.full.pdf","2019-10-02","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"A Personalized Multi-Component Lifestyle Intervention Program Leads to Improved Quality of Life in Persons with Chronic Kidney Disease","Introduction: Lifestyle interventions have been shown to produce favorable changes in some health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, few such studies, employing real world methods have been completed in patients with CKD.
Objective: This study tested the effectiveness of a comprehensive, multicomponent, lifestyle intervention, delivered through individualized counseling on a variety of health outcomes in pre-dialysis CKD patients.
Methods: Eligible patients were assigned randomly to the intervention (TR) or usual care group (UC). A six-month home-based program involving personalized counseling to increase physical activity to recommended levels among stage G3a to G4 CKD patients while exchanging plant proteins for animal proteins was implemented.  Physical function, cardiovascular function, dietary intake, medication use, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were assessed at baseline and after 1-month, 3-months (M3) and 6-months (M6).
Results: Forty-two, patients (age 60.2 Â± 9.2, BMI 34.5 Â± 7.8) participated in this study (TR=27 UC=15). The intervention reduced (p<0.05) brachial (bSBP) and central systolic blood pressures (cSBP) at month 3 (M3) but both were attenuated at month 6 (M6). Scores on the effect of kidney disease subscale of the HRQOL measure improved in the intervention group at M3 and M6. There was no change in the other measures of HRQOL or in any physical function scores.
Conclusions: This personalized multi-component lifestyle intervention enabled CKD patients to self-report fewer concerns with how CKD affected their daily lives independent of changes in physical function.

"Primary motor cortex has independent representations for ipsilateral and contralateral arm movements but correlated representations for grasping","Motor commands for the arms and hands generally originate in contralateral motor cortex anatomically. However, ipsilateral primary motor cortex shows activity related to arm movement despite the lack of direct connections. The extent to which the activity related to ipsilateral movement is independent from that related to contralateral movement is unclear based on conflicting conclusions in prior work. Here we present the results of bilateral arm and hand movement tasks completed by two human subjects with intracortical microelectrode arrays implanted in left primary motor cortex for a clinical brain-computer interface study. Neural activity was recorded while they attempted to perform arm and hand movements in a virtual environment. This enabled us to quantify the strength and independence of motor cortical activity related to continuous movements of each arm. We also investigated the subjects' ability to control both arms through a brain-computer interface system. Through a number of experiments, we found that ipsilateral arm movement was represented independently of, but more weakly than, contralateral arm movement. However, the representation of grasping was correlated between the two hands. This difference between hand and arm representation was unexpected, and poses new questions about the different ways primary motor cortex controls hands and arms.","/content/10.1101/19008128v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008128v1.full.pdf","2019-10-02","Neurology

"Optimizing the deployment of ultra-low volume and indoor residual spraying for dengue outbreak response","Recent years have seen rising incidence of dengue and large outbreaks of Zika and chikungunya, which are all caused by viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. In most settings, the primary intervention against Aedes-transmitted viruses is vector control, such as indoor, ultra-low volume (ULV) spraying. Targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS) has the potential to more effectively impact Aedes-borne diseases, but its implementation requires careful planning and evaluation. The optimal time to deploy these interventions and their relative epidemiological effects are not well understood, however. We used an agent-based model of dengue virus transmission calibrated to data from Iquitos, Peru to assess the epidemiological effects of these interventions under differing strategies for deploying them. Specifically, we compared strategies where spray application was initiated when incidence rose above a threshold based on incidence in recent years to strategies where spraying occurred at the same time(s) each year. In the absence of spraying, the model predicted 361,000 infections [inter-quartile range (IQR): 347,000 - 383,000] in the period 2000-2010. The ULV strategy with the fewest median infections was spraying twice yearly, in March and October, which led to a median of 172,000 infections [IQR: 158,000 - 183,000] over the 11-year study period, a 52% reduction from baseline. Compared to spraying once yearly in September, the best threshold-based strategy utilizing ULV had fewer median infections (254,000 vs. 261,000), but required more spraying (351 vs. 274 days). For TIRS, the best strategy was threshold-based, which led to the fewest infections of all strategies tested (9,900; [IQR: 8,720 - 11,400], a 94% reduction), and required fewer days spraying than the equivalent ULV strategy (280). Although spraying twice each year is likely to avert the most infections, our results indicate that a threshold-based strategy can become an alternative to better balance the translation of spraying effort into impact, particularly if used with a residual insecticide.","/content/10.1101/19007971v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007971v1.full.pdf","2019-10-02","Epidemiology

"Machine learning assisted DSC-MRI radiomics as a tool for glioma classification by grade and mutation status","Background: Machine learning assisted MRI radiomics, which combines MRI techniques with machine learning methodology, is rapidly gaining attention as a promising method for staging of brain gliomas. Our study assess the diagnostic value of such machine learning for DSC-MRI radiomics in classifying treatment-naive gliomas from a multi-center patient pool into WHO grades II-IV and across their isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status.
Methods: 333 patients from 6 tertiary centres, diagnosed histologically and molecularly with primary gliomas (IDH-mutant=151 or IDH-wildtype=182) were retrospectively identified. Raw DSC-MRI data was post-processed for normalised leakage-corrected relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps. Shape, intensity distribution (histogram) and rotational invariant Haralick texture features over the tumour mask were extracted. Differences in extracted features between IDH-wildtype and IDH-mutant gliomas and across three glioma grades were tested using the Wilcoxon two-sample test. A random forest algorithm was employed (2-fold cross-validation, 250 repeats) to predict grades or mutation status using the extracted features. 
Results: Features from all types (shape, distribution, texture) showed significant differences across mutation status. WHO grade II-III differentiation was mostly driven by shape features while texture and intensity feature were more relevant for the III-IV separation. Increased number of features became significant when differentiating grades further apart from one another. Gliomas were correctly stratified by IDH mutation status in 71% of the cases and by grade in 53% of the cases. In addition, 87% of the gliomas grades predicted with an error distance up to 1.
Conclusion: Despite large heterogeneity in the multi-center dataset, machine learning assisted DSC-MRI radiomics hold potential to address the inherent variability and presents a promising approach for non-invasive glioma molecular subtyping and grading.

"A Comparison of the Randomized Clinical Trial Efficacy and Real-World Effectiveness of Tofacitinib for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Cohort Study","Background: Real-world data are receiving attention from regulators, biopharmaceuticals and payors as a potential source of clinical evidence. However, the suitability of these data to produce evidence commensurate with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the best practices in their use remain unclear. We sought to compare the real-world effectiveness of Tofacitinib in the treatment of IBD against efficacy rates published by corresponding RCTs. 

Methods: Electronic health records at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) were queried and reviewed to identify 86 Tofacitinib-treated IBD patients through 4/2019. The primary endpoint was treatment effectiveness. This was measured by time-to-treatment-discontinuation and by the primary endpoints of RCTs in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). Endpoints were measured and analyzed following a previously published protocol and analysis plan.

Findings: 86 patients (68 with UC, 18 with CD) initiated Tofacitinib for IBD treatment. Most of the data needed to calculate baseline and follow-up disease activity indices were documented within the EHR (77% for UC, 91% for CD). Baseline characteristics of the UCSF and RCT cohorts were similar, except for a longer disease duration and 100% treatment failure of Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitors in the former. None of the UCSF cohort would have met the RCT eligibility criteria due to multiple reasons. 

The rate of achieving the RCT primary endpoints were highly similar to the published rates for both UC (16%, P=0.5) and CD (38%, P=0.8). However, treatment persistence was substantially higher: 69% for UC (week 52) and 75% for CD (week 26). 

Interpretation: An analysis of routinely collected clinical data can reproduce published Tofacitinib efficacy rates, but also indicates far greater treatment durability than suggested by RCTs including possible benefit in CD. These results underscore the value of real-world studies to complement RCTs.

We hypothesized that if clozapine-associated hypogammaglobulinaemia was clinically relevant this would manifest in referral patterns. 
Methods: Retrospective case note review of patients referred and assessed by Immunology Centre for Wales (ICW) between January 2005 and July 2018 with extraction of clinical and immunologic features for individuals with diagnosis of schizophrenia-like illness.
Results: 1791 adult patients were assessed at ICW during this period; 23 patients had a psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder. Principal indications for referral were findings of low calculated globulin and immunoglobulins. Clozapine was the single most commonly prescribed antipsychotic (17/23), disproportionately increased relative to reported use in the general schizophrenia population (OR 6.48, 95% CI: 1.79 to 23.5). Clozapine therapy was noted in 6/7 (86%) of patients subsequently requiring immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT). Marked reduction of class-switched memory B-cells (CSMB) and plasmablasts were observed in clozapine-treated individuals relative to healthy age-matched controls. Clozapine duration is associated with CSMB decline. One patient discontinued clozapine, with gradual recovery of IgG levels without use of IgRT. 
Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with enrichment of clozapine-treatment within schizophrenic individuals referred for ICW assessment over the last 13 years. These individuals displayed clinical patterns closely resembling the primary immunodeficiency CVID, however appears reversible upon drug cessation. This has diagnostic, monitoring and treatment implications for psychiatry and immunology teams and directs prospective studies to address causality and the wider implications for this patient group.","/content/10.1101/19007815v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007815v1.full.pdf","2019-10-02","Allergy and Immunology

"Spinal muscular atrophy diagnosis and carrier screening from whole-genome sequencing data","Purpose: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), caused by loss of the functional SMN1 gene but retention of the paralogous SMN2 gene, is a leading genetic cause of early childhood death. Due to the near identical sequences of SMN1 and its paralog SMN2, analysis of this region by standard NGS-based pipelines has been challenging historically. Preconception population-wide SMA screening of potential parents to quantify the copy number (CN) of SMN1 is recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics. Methods: We developed a novel informatics method that accurately identifies the CN of SMN1 and SMN2 using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This algorithm calculates the CNs of SMN1 and SMN2 using read depth and eight informative reference genome differences between SMN1 and SMN2. Results: We characterized SMN1/2 in a total of 12,747 genomes sequenced to high depths (>30x) across five ethnic populations. Across these samples we identified a total of 251 (1317) samples with whole gene losses (gains) of SMN1 and 6241 (374) samples with losses (gains) of SMN2. We calculated a pan-ethnic carrier frequency of 2%, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, we validated our CN calls and showed that all (48/48) SMN1 and 98% (47/48) of SMN2 CN calls agreed with those measured with digital PCR. Conclusion: This WGS-based SMN copy number caller can be used to identify both carrier and affected status of SMA, enabling SMA testing to be offered as a comprehensive test in neonatal care and also an accurate screening tool for carrier status in large-scale WGS sequencing projects.","/content/10.1101/19006635v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006635v1.full.pdf","2019-10-02","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Subacute effects of the psychedelic ayahuasca on the salience and default mode networks","Background: Recent years have seen a growing interest in the therapeutic use of psychedelic substances for the treatment of anxiety and depression in patients with affective and mood disorders. Neuroimaging studies have just begun to explore how brain networks supporting perceptual and higher-order cognitive and emotional functions are affected during the acute effects of psychedelics. Even less is known on the neural correlates of the subacute effects taking place one to a few days after the psychedelic experience. This study explores the subacute changes of primary sensory brain networks and networks supporting higher-order affective and self-referential functions after a single session with the psychedelic ayahuasca.
Methods: We leveraged task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging data one day before and one day after a randomized placebo-controlled trial exploring the effects of ayahuasca in naive healthy participants (21 placebo/22 ayahuasca). We derived functional connectivity maps of the salience, default mode, visual and sensorimotor networks using a seed-to-whole brain connectivity approach, and statistically assessed post-session functional connectivity changes between the ayahuasca and placebo groups. Connectivity changes were subsequently associated with scores of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale assessed during the acute session.
Results: Our findings revealed increased functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex of the salience network and decreased functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex of the default mode network one day after the session in the ayahuasca group. No connectivity changes between groups were found in primary sensory networks. Subacute increased connectivity of the salience network correlated positively with altered somesthesia scores assessed during the acute effects of ayahuasca, while decreased connectivity of the default mode network correlated negatively with altered volition scores.
Conclusion: These findings provide preliminary evidence for subacute functional changes induced by the psychedelic ayahuasca on higher-order cognitive brain networks known to support interoceptive, affective, and self-referential processes.","/content/10.1101/19007542v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007542v1.full.pdf","2019-09-29","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"A Quantitative and Narrative Evaluation of Goodman and Gilmans Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics","Objective: Goodman and Gilmans The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (GGPBT) has been a cornerstone in the education of pharmacists, physicians, and pharmacologists for decades. The objectives of this report were to describe and evaluate the 13th edition of GGPBT including 1) author characteristics; 2) recency of citations; 3) conflict of interest (CoI) disclosure, and 4) expert evaluation of chapters. 

Methods: Contributors (N = 115) sex, professional degrees, and presence of undisclosed potential CoI as reported by the Center for Medicare and Medicaids Open Payments (2013 to 2017) were examined. Year of publication of citations were extracted relative to comparison textbooks (Katzungs Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (KatBCP) and DiPiros Pharmacotherapy: A Pathophysiologic Approach (DiPPAPA). Content experts in pharmacy and pharmacology education provided chapter reviews.

Results: The percent of GGPBT contributors that were female (20.9%) was equivalent to those in KatBCP (17.0%).  Citations in GGPBT (11.5 + 0.2 years) were significantly older than those in KatBCP (10.4 + 0.2) and DiPPAPA (9.1 + 0.1, p < .0001). Contributors to GGPBT received three million in undisclosed remuneration from pharmaceutical companies (Maximum author = $743,718). In contrast, DiPPAPA made CoI information available. However, self-reported disclosures were not uniformly congruent with Open Payments reported data. Reviewers noted several strengths but also some areas for improvement.

Conclusion: GGPBT will continue to be an important component of the biomedical curriculum. Areas of improvement include more diverse authorship, improved conflict of interest transparency, and greater inclusion of more recent citations.","/content/10.1101/19007385v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007385v1.full.pdf","2019-09-29","Medical Education

"Travel time to health facilities as a marker of geographical accessibility across heterogeneous land coverage in Peru","The geographical accessibility to health facilities is conditioned by the topography and environmental conditions overlapped with different transport facilities between rural and urban areas. To better estimate the travel time to the most proximate health facility infrastructure and determine the differences across heterogeneous land coverage types, this study explored the use of a novel cloud-based geospatial modeling approach and use as a case study the unique geographical and ecological diversity in the Peruvian territory. Geospatial data of 145,134 cities and villages and 8,067 health facilities in Peru were gathered with land coverage types, roads infrastructure, navigable river networks, and digital elevation data to produce high-resolution (30 m) estimates of travel time to the most proximate health facility across the country. This study estimated important variations in travel time between urban and rural settings across the 16 major land coverage types in Peru, that in turn, overlaps with socio-economic profiles of the villages. The median travel time to primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare facilities was 1.9, 2.3, and 2.2 folds higher in rural than urban settings, respectively. Also, higher travel time values were observed in areas with a high proportion of the population with unsatisfied basic needs. In so doing, this study provides a new methodology to estimate travel time to health facilities as a tool to enhance the understanding and characterization of the profiles of accessibility to health facilities in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), calling for a service delivery redesign to maximize high quality of care.","/content/10.1101/19007856v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007856v1.full.pdf","2019-09-29","Public and Global Health

"The global burden of pressure ulcers among patients with spinal cord injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Background: Pressure ulcer one of the common challenging public health problems affecting patient with spinal cord injury is the formation of lesion and ulceration on the skin specially in the bony prominence areas. It has a significant impact to the patient and health care system. Moreover it has psychological physical social burden and decrease the quality of life (QoL) of patients. Despite its serious complications limited evidence is available on the global magnitude of pressure ulcers among patient with spinal cord injury. Hence the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the global magnitude of pressure ulcers among patient with spinal cord injury.
Methods: PubMed Scopus Google Scholar Africa journal online PsycINFO and web-science were systematically searched online to retrieve related articles. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed. The random-effects model was fitted to estimate the summary effect. To investigate heterogeneity across the included studies I2 test was employed. Publication bias was examined using funnel plot and Egger regression test statistic. All statistical analysis was done using STATA version 14 software for windows. 
Results: Twenty-four studies which comprises of 600 078 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The global pooled magnitude of pressure ulcer among patients with spinal cord injury was 32.36% (95% CI (28.21- 36.51%)). Based on the subgroup analysis, the highest magnitude of pressure ulcer was observed in Africa 41.19% (95% CI: 31.70- 52.18).
Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that about one in three patients with spinal cord injury had pressure ulcers. This implies that the overall global magnitude of pressure ulcer is relatively high. Therefore, policymakers (FMoH) and other concerned bodies need give special attention to reduce the magnitude of pressure ulcers in patient with spinal cord injury.","/content/10.1101/19007237v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007237v1.full.pdf","2019-09-29","Nursing

"Havana Syndrome Among Canadian Diplomats: Brain Imaging Reveals Acquired Neurotoxicity","BACKGROUND: In late 2016, US diplomats stationed in Havana began presenting with a variety of neurological manifestations that proved difficult to diagnose. Though previous studies suggested a likely association with brain injury, the mechanism of injury, brain regions involved, and etiology remained unknown. 

METHODS: We conducted a multimodal study examining 26 Canadian diplomats and their family members, the majority of whom presented with symptoms similar to their American counterparts while residing in Havana. Assessments included a medical history, self-reported symptom questionnaires, cognitive assessments, blood tests, and brain imaging assessments (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)). Individuals showing signs of brain injury underwent further neurological, visual, and audio-vestibular assessments. Eight participants were tested both before and after living in Havana.

RESULTS: Our assessment documents multiple functional and structural impairments, including significant spatial memory impairment, abnormal brain-stem evoked potentials, degradation of fibre tracts in the fornix and posterior corpus callosum, blood-brain barrier injury to the right basal forebrain and anterior insula, and abnormal paroxysmal slowing events of cortical activity. Subsequent mass-spectrometry and blood analyses documented reduced serum cholinesterase activity and the presence of organophosphates (Temephos) and pyrethroid metabolites (3-phenoxybenzoic acid or 3-BPA).

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm brain injury, specify the regions involved, and raise the hypothesis of overexposure to cholinesterase inhibitors as a plausible etiology. If correct, our hypothesis bears public health ramifications (see Discussion) and suggests a course of action for reducing exposure in the future.

"Acquisition of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) carriage after exposure to systemic antimicrobials during travel: systematic review and meta-analysis.","Background: International travel is an important risk factor for colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE). Antimicrobial use during travel likely amplifies this risk, yet to what extent, and whether it varies by antimicrobial class, has not been established. Methods: We conducted a systematic review that included prospective cohorts reporting both receipt of systemic antimicrobials and acquired ESBL-PE isolated from stool or rectum during international travel. We performed a random effects meta-analysis to estimate odds of acquiring ESBL-PE due to antimicrobials during travel, overall and by antimicrobial class. Results: Fifteen studies were included. The study population was mainly female travellers from high income countries recruited primarily from travel clinics. Participants travelled most frequently to Asia and Africa with 10% reporting antimicrobial use during travel. The combined odds ratio (OR) for ESBL-PE acquisition during travel was 2.37 for antimicrobial use overall (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69 to 3.33), but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies. Fluoroquinolones were the antibiotic class associated with the highest combined OR of ESBL-PE acquisition, compared to no antimicrobial use (OR 4.68, 95% CI, 2.34 to 9.37). Conclusions: The risk of ESBL-PE colonization during travel is increased substantially with exposure to antimicrobials, especially fluoroquinolones. While a small proportion of colonized individuals will develop a resistant infection, there remains the potential for onward spread among returning travellers. Public health efforts to decrease inappropriate antimicrobial usage during travel are warranted.","/content/10.1101/19007781v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007781v1.full.pdf","2019-09-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Machine learning-based prediction of response to PARP inhibition across cancer types.","PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are FDA approved for the treatment of BRCA1/2 deficient breast and ovarian cancer, but a growing body of pre-clinical evidence suggests the drug class holds therapeutic potential in other cancer types, independent of BRCA1/2 status. Large-scale pharmacogenomic datasets offer the opportunity to develop predictors of response to PARPis in many cancer types, expanding their potential clinical applicability. Response to the PARPi olaparib was used to identify a multi-gene PARPi response signature in a large in vitro dataset including multiple cancer types, such as breast, ovarian, pancreatic, lung cancer, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, using machine learning approaches. The signature was validated on multiple independent in vitro datasets, also testing for response to another PARPi, rucaparib, as well as two clinical datasets using the cisplatin response as a surrogate for PARPi response. Finally, integrative pharmacogenomic analysis was performed to identify drugs which may be effective in PARPi resistant tumors. A PARPi response signature was defined as the 50 most differentially transcribed genes between PARPi resistant and sensitive cell lines from several different cancer types. Cross validated predictors generated with LASSO logistic regression using the PARPi signature genes accurately predicted PARPi response in a training set of olaparib treated cell lines (80-89%), an independent olaparib treated in vitro dataset (66-77%), and an independent rucaparib treated in vitro dataset (80-87%). The PARPi signature also significantly predicted in vitro breast cancer response to olaparib in another separate experimental dataset. The signature also predicted clinical response to cisplatin and survival in human ovarian cancer and osteosarcoma datasets. Robust transcriptional differences between PARPi sensitive and resistant tumors accurately predict PARPi response in vitro and cisplatin response in vivo for multiple tumor types with or without known BRCA1/2 deficiency. These signatures may prove useful for predicting response in patients treated with PARP inhibitors.","/content/10.1101/19007757v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007757v1.full.pdf","2019-09-27","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Whole genome sequencing identifies putative associations between genomic polymorphisms and clinical response to the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam","In the context of pharmacogenomics, whole genome sequencing provides a powerful approach for identifying correlations between response variability to specific drugs and genomic polymorphisms in a population, in an unbiased manner. In this study, we employed whole genome sequencing of DNA samples from patients showing extreme response (n=72) and non-response (n=27) to the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam, in order to identify genomic variants that underlie response to the drug. No common SNPs (MAF>5%) crossed the conventional genome-wide significance threshold of 5e-8. However, we found common polymorphisms in genes SPNS3, HDC, MDGA2, NSG1 and RASGEF1C, which collectively predict clinical response to levetiracetam in our cohort with ~91% predictive accuracy (~94% positive predictive value, ~85% negative predictive value). Among these genes, HDC, NSG1, MDGA2 and RASGEF1C are potentially implicated in synaptic neurotransmission. SPNS3 is an atypical solute carrier transporter, homologous to SV2A, the known molecular target of levetiracetam. Furthermore, we performed gene- and pathway-based statistical analysis on sets of rare and low-frequency variants (MAF<5%) and we identified associations between genes or pathways and response to levetiracetam. Our findings include a) the genes PRKCB and DLG2, which are involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission, a known target of anticonvulsants, including levetiracetam; b) the genes FILIP1 and SEMA6D, which are involved in axon guidance and modelling of neural connections; and c) pathways with a role in synaptic neurotransmission, such as WNT5A-dependent internalization of FZD4 and disinhibition of SNARE formation. Targeted analysis of genes involved in neurotransmitter release and transport further supports the possibility of association between drug response and genes NSG1 and DLG2. In summary, our approach to utilise whole genome sequencing on subjects with extreme response phenotypes is a feasible route to generate plausible hypotheses for investigating the genetic factors underlying drug response variability in cases of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy.","/content/10.1101/19007674v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007674v1.full.pdf","2019-09-27","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Interleukin-6 signaling effects on ischemic stroke and other cardiovascular outcomes: a Mendelian Randomization study","Background: Studies in humans and experimental models highlight a role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cardiovascular disease. Indirect evidence suggests that inhibition of IL-6 signaling could lower risk of coronary artery disease. However, whether such an approach would be effective for ischemic stroke and other cardiovascular outcomes remains unknown.
Methods: In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 204,402 European individuals, we identified genetic proxies for downregulated IL-6 signaling as genetic variants in the IL-6 receptor (IL6R) locus that were associated with lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a downstream effector of IL-6 signaling. We then applied two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore associations with ischemic stroke and its major subtypes (large artery stroke, cardioembolic stroke, small vessel stroke) in the MEGASTROKE dataset (34,217 cases and 404,630 controls), with coronary artery disease in the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D dataset (60,801 cases and 123,504 control), and with other cardiovascular outcomes in the UK Biobank (up to 321,406 individuals) and in phenotype-specific GWAS datasets. All effect estimates were scaled to the CRP-decreasing effects of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-6R. 
Results: We identified 7 genetic variants as proxies for downregulated IL-6 signaling, which showed effects on upstream regulators (IL-6 and soluble IL-6R levels) and downstream effectors (CRP and fibrinogen levels) of the pathway that were consistent with pharmacological blockade of IL-6R. In MR, proxies for downregulated IL-6 signaling were associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.89, 95%CI: 0.82-0.97) and coronary artery disease (OR: 0.84, 95%CI: 0.77-0.90). Focusing on ischemic stroke subtypes, we found significant associations with risk of large artery (OR: 0.76, 95%CI: 0.62-0.93) and small vessel stroke (OR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.59-0.86), but not cardioembolic stroke (OR: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.74-1.22). Proxies for IL-6 signaling inhibition were further associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction, aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation and carotid plaque.
Conclusions: We provide evidence for a causal effect of IL-6 signaling on ischemic stroke, particularly large artery and small vessel stroke, and a range of other cardiovascular outcomes. IL-6R blockade might represent a valid therapeutic target for lowering cardiovascular risk and should thus be investigated in clinical trials.","/content/10.1101/19007682v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007682v1.full.pdf","2019-09-27","Epidemiology

"Genetic Diversity of the cagA gene of Helicobacter pylori strains from Sudanese Patients with Different Gastroduodenal Diseases","Background: There is an increase in the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in Sudan, accompanied by a high incidence of upper gastrointestinal malignancy. The cytotoxin-associated gene cagA gene is a marker of a pathogenicity island (PAI) in H. pylori and plays a crucial role in determining the clinical outcome of Helicobacter infections.
Objective:  This study aimed to determine the frequency and heterogeneity of the cagA gene of H. pylori and correlate the presence of cagA gene with clinical outcomes.
Materials and methods: Fifty endoscopy biopsies were collected from Fedail and Soba hospitals in Khartoum state. DNA was extracted using the Guanidine chloride method followed by PCR to amplify 16S rRNA and cagA gene of H. pylori using specific primers. DNA amplicons of cagA gene were purified and sequenced. Bioinformatics and statistical analysis were done to characterize and to test the association between cagA gene and gastric complications.
Results: CagA gene was detected in 20/37(54%) of the samples that were found positive for H. pylori. There was no association between endoscopy finding and the presence of the cagA gene (p = 0.225). Specific amino acid variations were found at seven loci related to strains from a patient with duodenitis, gastric ulcer, and gastric atrophy (R448H, T457K, S460L, IT463-464VA, D470E, A482Q, KNV490-491-492TKT) while mutations in cancerous strain were A439P, T457P, and H500Y.
Conclusion: Disease-specific variations of cagA of H. pylori strains, in the region of amino acid residues 428-510, were evident among Sudanese patients with different gastroduodenal diseases. A novel mutation (K458N) was detected in a patient with duodenitis, which affects the positive electrostatic surface of cagA. Phylogenetic analysis showed a high level of diversity of cagA from Sudanese H. pylori strains.","/content/10.1101/19007435v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007435v1.full.pdf","2019-09-27","Gastroenterology

"Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Blocking Agents Reduce Risk for Alzheimer's Disease in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriasis","This large, retrospective case-control study of electronic health records from 56 million unique adult patients examined whether or not treatment with a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blocking agent reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, and other inflammatory diseases which are mediated in part by TNF and for which a TNF blocker is an approved treatment.   The analysis compared the diagnosis of AD as an outcome measure in patients receiving at least one prescription for a TNF blocking agent (etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab) or for methotrexate.  RA increased the risk for AD (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.06, 95% Confidence Interval: (2.02-2.10), P-value <0.0001) as did psoriasis (AOR = 1.37 (1.31-1.42), P <0.0001), ankylosing spondylitis (AOR = 1.57 (1.39-1.77), P <0.0001) , inflammatory bowel disease (AOR = 2.46 (2.33-2.59), P < 0.0001), ulcerative colitis (AOR = 1.82 (1.74-1.91), P <0.0001), and Crohn's disease (AOR = 2.33 (2.22-2.43), P <0.0001). The risk for AD in patients with RA was reduced by treatment with etanercept (AOR = 0.34 (0.25-0.47), P <0.0001), adalimumab (AOR = 0.28 (0.19-0.39), P < 0.0001), and infliximab (AOR = 0.52 (0.39-0.69), P <0.0001).  Methotrexate also reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease (AOR = 0.64 (0.61-0.68), P <0.0001), while further risk reduction was achieved in patients with a prescription history for both a TNF blocker and methotrexate.  Etanercept and adalimumab also reduced the risk for AD in patients with psoriasis: AOR = 0.47 (0.30-0.73 and 0.41 (0.20-0.76), respectively.  There was no effect of gender or race, while younger patients showed greater benefit from a TNF blocker than did older patients.  This study identifies a subset of patients in whom systemic inflammation contributes to risk for AD through a pathological mechanism involving TNF and who therefore may benefit from treatment with a TNF blocking agent.","/content/10.1101/19007666v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007666v1.full.pdf","2019-09-27","Neurology

"A metabolite-based machine learning approach to diagnose Alzheimer's-type dementia in blood: Results from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease biomarker discovery cohort","INTRODUCTION: Machine learning (ML) may harbor the potential to capture the metabolic complexity in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Here we set out to test the performance of metabolites in blood to categorise AD when compared to CSF biomarkers.
METHODS: This study analysed samples from 242 cognitively normal (CN) people and 115 with AD-type dementia utilizing plasma metabolites (n=883). Deep Learning (DL), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) were used to differentiate AD from CN. These models were internally validated using Nested Cross Validation (NCV).
RESULTS: On the test data, DL produced the AUC of 0.85 (0.80-0.89), XGBoost produced 0.88 (0.86-0.89) and RF produced 0.85 (0.83-0.87). By comparison, CSF measures of amyloid, p-tau and t-tau (together with age and gender) produced with XGBoost the AUC values of 0.78, 0.83 and 0.87, respectively.
DISCUSSION: This study showed that plasma metabolites have the potential to match the AUC of well-established AD CSF biomarkers in a relatively small cohort. Further studies in independent cohorts are needed to validate whether this specific panel of blood metabolites can separate AD from controls, and how specific it is for AD as compared with other neurodegenerative disorders.","/content/10.1101/19007146v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007146v1.full.pdf","2019-09-27","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Assessing psychiatric comorbid disorders of cognition: A machine learning approach using UK Biobank data","Background: Using UK Biobank data from baseline to the imaging study, our aim was to investigate whether participants with comorbid psychiatric disorders suffer from higher risk of impaired cognition over time compared to those without. There are several conventional statistical techniques to examine whether this pattern indicates the increased risk of comorbidity of the aforementioned, however, they carry certain inherent limitations. Machine learning (ML) has shown specific advantages in examining potential predictors simultaneously in an unbiased manner, especially its ability to identify patterns of information within useful features for the prediction of an outcome of interest. We applied ML techniques on UK Biobank data to examine whether anxiety and/or depression are important longitudinal predictors of impaired cognition.
Methods: We used data from UK Biobank (n = 1.158) across three time waves to longitudinally assess the effects of comorbidity (anxiety and depression, measured through self-report scales) on cognition. Theta (T) measures for each mental health scale were computed using item response theory (IRT) and intraindividual variability of reaction time performance (IIV) - raw standard deviation - was used as a measure of cognitive performance. First, comorbidity information was summarized to show the variation of impaired cognition for participants with and without psychiatric disorders. A machine learning (ML) approach was then applied to examine if psychiatric disorders and other putative covariate markers may be important predictors of long-term cognitive decline. 
Results: For participants with anxiety, the percentage of having impaired cognition constantly increases through time from 35.09% to 42.15%; in contrast, an increase with less magnitude is found for participants without anxiety from 36.10% to 40.03%. Likewise, for participants with depression, the percentage of having impaired cognition constantly increases through time from 35.49% to 41.67%; in contrast, an increase with less magnitude is found for participants without depression from 35.64% to 40.52%. Using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve it was observed that the anxiety model achieved the best performance among all models, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.68, followed by the depression model with an AUC of 0.64. The cardiovascular and diabetes model and the demographics model had relatively weak performance in predicting cognition, with an AUC of 0.60 and 0.57, respectively.  
Conclusions: Using data from UK Biobank, this study provides empirical evidence which suggests that psychiatric disorders are important comorbidities of cognitive decline. Furthermore, when other comorbidities were included in the model these were not as important on long-term effect. When the recurrent neural networks were trained for the psychiatric disorder features (anxiety and depression) they showed improved performance in predicting cognition in comparison with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and demographic factors. These findings suggest that mental health disorders (anxiety and depression) have a deleterious effect on long-term cognition, and may be considered an important comorbid disorder of cognitive decline. The implications of this work is that the important predictive effect of poor mental health on longitudinal cognitive decline should be considered in both research and clinical settings.","/content/10.1101/19006189v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006189v1.full.pdf","2019-09-27","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"EventEpi â€” A Natural Language Processing Framework for Event-Based Surveillance","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 60% of all outbreaks are detected using informal sources.
  In many public-health institutes, including the WHO and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), dedicated groups of epidemiologists sift through numerous articles and newsletters to detect relevant events. This media screening is one important part of event-based surveillance (EBS). Reading the articles, discussing their relevance, and putting key information into a database is a time-consuming process. To support EBS, but also to gain insights into what makes an article and the event it describes relevant, we developed a natural-language-processing framework for automated information extraction and relevance scoring. First, we scraped relevant sources for EBS as done at RKI (WHO Disease Outbreak News and ProMED) and automatically extracted the articles' key data: disease, country, date, and confirmed-case count. For this, we performed named entity recognition in two steps: EpiTator, an open-source epidemiological annotation tool, suggested many different possibilities for each. We trained a naive Bayes classifier to find the single most likely one using RKI's EBS database as labels. Then, for relevance scoring, we defined two classes to which any article might belong: The article is relevant if it is in the EBS database and irrelevant otherwise. We compared the performance of different classifiers, using document and word embeddings. Two of the tested algorithms stood out: The multilayer perceptron performed best overall, with a precision of 0.19, recall of 0.50, specificity of 0.89, F1 of 0.28, and the highest tested index balanced accuracy of 0.46. The support-vector machine, on the other hand, had the highest recall (0.88) which can be of higher interest for epidemiologists. Finally, we integrated these functionalities into a web application called EventEpi where relevant sources are automatically analyzed and put into a database. The user can also provide any URL or text, that will be analyzed in the same way and added to the database.
  Each of these steps could be improved, in particular with larger labeled datasets and fine-tuning of the learning algorithms. The overall framework, however, works already well and can be used in production, promising improvements in EBS. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/aauss/EventEpi.","/content/10.1101/19006395v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006395v2.full.pdf","2019-09-26","Health Informatics

"Risk factors for heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction among Medicare beneficiaries: Applications of competing risks analysis and gradient boosted model.","Background: The differential impact of various demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions on development of heart failure (HF) with preserved (pEF) and reduced ejection fraction (rEF) is not well studied among the elderly. 
Methods and Results: Using Medicare claims data linked to electronic health records, we conducted an observational cohort study of individuals = 65 years of age without HF. A Cox proportional hazards model accounting for competing risk of HFrEF and HFpEF incidence was constructed. A gradient boosted model (GBM) assessed the relative influence (RI) of each predictor in development of HFrEF and HFpEF. Among 138,388 included individuals, 9,701 developed HF (IR= 20.9 per 1,000 person-year). Males were more likely to develop HFrEF than HFpEF (HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.81-2.37 vs. 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02-1.20, P for heterogeneity < 0.01). Atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension had stronger associations with the risk of HFpEF (HR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.80-2.26 and 1.66, 95% CI: 1.23-2.22) while cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction were more strongly associated with HFrEF (HR = 4.37, 95% CI: 3.21-5.97 and 1.94, 95% CI: 1.23-3.07). Age was the strongest predictor across all HF subtypes with RI from GBM >35%. Atrial fibrillation was the most influential comorbidity for development of HFpEF (RI = 8.4%) while cardiomyopathy was most influential for HFrEF (RI = 20.7%). 
Conclusions: These findings of heterogeneous relationships between several important risk factors and heart failure types underline the potential differences in the etiology of HFpEF and HFrEF.","/content/10.1101/19003509v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003509v2.full.pdf","2019-09-26","Epidemiology

"A Hybrid Machine Learning Framework to Predict Early Risk of Mortality in Paralytic Ileus Patients using Electronic Health Records.","Background and Objective: Paralytic Ileus (PI) is the pseudo-obstruction of the intestine secondary to intestinal muscle paralysis. PI is caused by several reasons such as overuse of medications, spinal injuries, inflammation, abdominal surgery, etc. We have developed an early
mortality prediction framework that can help intensivist, surgeons, and other medical professionals to optimize clinical management for PI patients in terms of optimal treatment strategy and resource planning.
Methods: We used a publicly available ICU database called MIMIC III v1.4, extracted patients that had paralytic ileus as a primary diagnosis over the age of 18 years old. We developed the FLAIM Framework a two-phase model (Phase I: Statistical testing and Phase II: Machine Learning application) that compared to traditional methods of machine learning. We used five different machine learning algorithms to test the validity of our Framework. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework by comparing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, and area under the curve (AUC) for each model.
Results: The most considerable improvement in AUC of 7.78% was observed due to the application of the proposed FLAIM method. Additionally, almost for all the machine learning models, an increase in accuracy was also found. With the FLAIM framework, we recorded an
accuracy of 81.30% and AUC of 81.38% under the support vector machine (with RBF kernel) model in predicting mortality during a hospital stay for the PI patients.
Discussion: Our results show promising clinical outcome prediction and application for individual patients admitted to the ICU with paralytic ileus after the first 24 hours of admission.","/content/10.1101/19006254v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006254v2.full.pdf","2019-09-26","Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine

"Natural Language Processing for Mimicking Clinical Trial Recruitment in Critical Care: A Semi-automated Simulation Based on the LeoPARDS Trial","Clinical trials often fail on recruiting an adequate number of appropriate patients. Identifying eligible trial participants is a resource-intensive task when relying on manual review of clinical notes, particularly in critical care settings where the time window is short. Automated review of electronic health records has been explored as a way of identifying trial participants, but much of the information is in unstructured free text rather than a computable form. We developed an electronic health record pipeline that combines structured electronic health record data with free text in order to simulate recruitment into the LeoPARDS trial. We applied an algorithm to identify eligible patients using a moving 1-hour time window, and compared the set of patients identified by our approach with those actually screened and recruited for the trial. We manually reviewed clinical records for a random sample of additional patients identified by the algorithm but not identified for screening in the original trial. Our approach identified 308 patients, of whom 208 were screened in the actual trial. We identified all 40 patients with CCHIC data available who were actually recruited to LeoPARDS in our centre. The algorithm identified 96 patients on the same day as manual screening and 62 patients one or two days earlier. Analysis of electronic health records incorporating natural language processing tools could effectively replicate recruitment in a critical care trial, and identify some eligible patients at an earlier stage. If implemented in real-time this could improve the efficiency of clinical trial recruitment.","/content/10.1101/19005603v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005603v2.full.pdf","2019-09-26","Health Informatics

"AETIONOMY, a Cross-Sectional Study Aimed at validating a new taxonomy of Neurodegenerative Diseases: Study design and subject characteristics","Background: Although advances in the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) have led to improvements in classification and diagnosis and most importantly to new therapies, the unmet medical needs remain significant due to high treatment failure rates. The AETIONOMY project funded by the Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI) aims at using multi-OMICs and bioinformatics to identify new classifications for NDDs based on common molecular pathophysiological mechanisms in view of improving the availability of personalised treatments. 

Objectives: The purpose of the AETIONOMY cross-sectional study is to validate novel patient classification criteria provided by these tools.

Methods: This was a European multi centre, cross-sectional, clinical study conducted at 6 sites in 3 countries. Standardised clinical data, biosamples from peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, skin biopsies, and data from a multi-OMICs approach were collected in patients suffering from Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, as well as healthy controls. 

Results: From September 2015 to December 2017 a total of 421 participants were recruited including 95 Healthy Controls. Nearly 1,500 biological samples were collected. The study achieved its objective with respect to Parkinson disease (PD) recruitment, however it was unable to recruit many new Alzheimer Disease (AD) patients. Overall, data from 413 evaluable subjects (405 PD and 8 AD) are available for analysis. PD patients and controls were well matched with respect to age (mean 63.4 years), however, close gender matching was not achieved. Approximately half of all PD patients and one At-Risk subject were taking dopamine agonists; rates of Levodopa usage were slightly higher (~60%). Median MDS-UPDRS Part III Scores (OFF state) ranged from 45 (SD 18) in those with Genetic PD to 2 (SD 3) in Healthy Controls. The standardised methodologies applied resulted in a high-quality database with very few missing data.

Conclusion: This is one of the collaborative multi-OMICs studies in individuals suffering from PD and AD involving a control group. It is expected that the integration of data will provide new biomarker-led descriptions of clusters of patient subgroups.","/content/10.1101/19004804v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004804v2.full.pdf","2019-09-26","Neurology

"Childhood immune imprinting to influenza A shapes birth year-specific risk during seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 epidemics","Across decades of co-circulation in humans, influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have caused seasonal epidemics characterized by different age distributions of cases and mortality. H3N2 causes the majority of relatively severe, clinically attended cases in high-risk elderly cohorts, and the majority of overall deaths, whereas H1N1 causes fewer deaths overall, and cases shifted towards young and middle-aged adults. These contrasting age profiles may result from differences in childhood exposure to H1N1 and H3N2 or from differences in evolutionary rate between subtypes. Here we analyze a large epidemiological surveillance dataset to test whether childhood immune imprinting shapes seasonal influenza epidemiology, and if so, whether it acts primarily via immune memory of a particular influenza subtype or via broader immune memory that protects across subtypes. We also test the impact of evolutionary differences between influenza subtypes on age distributions of cases. Likelihood-based model comparison shows that narrow, within-subtype imprinting shapes seasonal influenza risk alongside age-specific risk factors. The data do not support a strong effect of evolutionary rate, or of broadly protective imprinting that acts across subtypes. Our findings emphasize that childhood exposures can imprint a lifelong immunological bias toward particular influenza subtypes, and that these cohort-specific biases shape epidemic age distributions. As a result, newer and less ""senior"" antibody responses acquired later in life do not provide the same strength of protection as responses imprinted in childhood.  Finally, we project that the relatively low mortality burden of H1N1 may increase in the coming decades, as cohorts that lack H1N1-specific imprinting eventually reach old age.","/content/10.1101/19001834v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001834v2.full.pdf","2019-09-26","Epidemiology

"Hidden heterogeneity and its influence on dengue vaccination impact","The CYD-TDV vaccine was recently developed to combat dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease that afflicts millions of people each year throughout the tropical and subtropical world. Its rollout has been complicated by recent findings that vaccinees with no prior exposure to dengue virus (DENV) experience an elevated risk of severe disease in response to their first DENV infection subsequent to vaccination. As a result of these findings, guidelines for use of CYD-TDV now require serological screening prior to vaccination to establish that an individual does not fall into this high-risk category. These complications mean that the public health impact of CYD-TDV vaccination is expected to be higher in areas with higher transmission. One important practical difficulty with tailoring vaccination policy to local transmission contexts is that DENV transmission is spatially heterogeneous, even at the scale of neighborhoods or blocks within a city. This raises the question of whether models based on data that average over spatial heterogeneity in transmission could fail to capture important aspects of CYD-TDV impact in spatially heterogeneous populations. We explored this question with a deterministic model of DENV transmission and CYD-TDV vaccination in a population comprised of two communities with differing transmission intensities. Compared to the full model, a version of the model based on the average of the two communities failed to capture benefits of targeting the intervention to the high-transmission community, which resulted in greater impact in both communities than we observed under even coverage. In addition, the model based on the average of the two communities substantially overestimated impact among vaccinated individuals in the low-transmission community. In the event that the specificity of serological screening is not high, this result suggests that models that ignore spatial heterogeneity could overlook the potential for harm to this segment of the population.","/content/10.1101/19006783v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006783v2.full.pdf","2019-09-26","Epidemiology

"The consistent burden in published estimates of delirium occurrence in medical inpatients over four decades: a systematic review and meta-analysis study","Introduction
Delirium is associated with a wide range of adverse patient safety outcomes. We sought to identify if trends in healthcare complexity were associated with changes in reported delirium in adult medical patients in the general hospital over the last four decades. 

Methods
We used identical criteria to a previous systematic review, including studies using DSM and ICD-10 criteria for delirium diagnosis. Random effects meta-analysis pooled estimates across studies, meta-regression estimated temporal changes, funnel plots assessed publication bias.

Results
Overall delirium occurrence was 23% (95% CI 19%-26%) (33 studies). There was no change between 1980-2019, nor was case-mix (average age of sample, proportion with dementia) different. There was evidence of increasing publication bias over time. 

Discussion
The incidence and prevalence of delirium in hospitals appears to be stable, though publication bias may mask true changes. Nonetheless, delirium remains a challenging and urgent priority for clinical diagnosis and care pathways.","/content/10.1101/19005165v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005165v2.full.pdf","2019-09-26","Geriatric Medicine

"Framework for rational donor selection in fecal microbiota transplant clinical trials","Early clinical successes are driving enthusiasm for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the transfer of healthy gut bacteria through whole stool, as emerging research is linking the microbiome to many different diseases. However, preliminary trials have yielded mixed results and suggest that heterogeneity in donor stool may play a role in patient response. Thus, clinical trials may fail because an ineffective donor was chosen rather than because FMT is not appropriate for the indication. Here, we describe a conceptual framework to guide rational donor selection to increase the likelihood that FMT clinical trials will succeed. We argue that the mechanism by which the microbiome is hypothesized to be associated with a given indication should inform how healthy donors are selected for FMT trials, categorizing these mechanisms into four disease models and presenting associated donor selection strategies. We next walk through examples based on previously published FMT trials and ongoing investigations to illustrate how donor selection might occur in practice. Finally, we show that typical FMT trials are not powered to discover individual taxa mediating patient responses, suggesting that clinicians should develop targeted hypotheses for retrospective analyses and design their clinical trials accordingly. Moving forward, developing and applying novel clinical trial design methodologies like rational donor selection will be necessary to ensure that FMT successfully translates into clinical impact.","/content/10.1101/19000307v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000307v2.full.pdf","2019-09-26","Gastroenterology

"Prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is a global health care problem and financially costly. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is common and frequent cause of morbidity and disability. Despite its serious complications,limited evidence is available on the magnitude of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patient with diabetes mellitus. Hence the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus in Africa.
Methods: PubMed Scopus Google Scholar Africa journal online WHO afro library and Cochrane review were systematically searched online to retrieve related articles. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed. Heterogeneity across the included studies was evaluated by inconsistency index (I2). Publication bias was examined by funnel plot and Egger regression test. The random-effect model was fitted to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among diabetes mellitus patients. All statistical analysis was done using STATA version 14 software for windows.
Results: Twenty-three studies which comprises of 269 691 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was 46% (95% CI:36.21-55.78%). Based on the subgroup analysis the highest magnitude of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was reported in West Africa 49.4% (95% CI: 32.74, 66.06).
Conclusion: This study revealed that the overall prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is relatively high in Africa. Hence, diabetic peripheral neuropathy needs situation based intervention and preventive strategy depending on their country context. Furthermore further meta-analysis study is needed to identify associated factors for the occurrence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

"Predicting Under-five mortality across 21 Low and Middle-Income Countries using Deep Learning Methods","Objectives:
To explore the efficacy of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in predicting under-five mortality in LMICs and to identify significant predictors of under-five mortality (U5M).
Design:
This is a cross-sectional, proof-of-concept study.
Settings and participants  
We analysed data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The data was drawn from 21 Low-and-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) countries (N = 1,048,575). Eligible mothers in each household were asked information about their children and the reproductive care they received during the pregnancy.
Primary and secondary outcome measures:
The primary outcome measure was under-five mortality; secondary outcome was comparing the efficacy of deep learning algorithms: Deep Neural Network (DNN); Convolution Neural Network (CNN); Hybrid CNN-DNN with Logistic Regression (LR) for the prediction of child survival. 
Results:
We found that duration of breast feeding, household wealth index and the level of maternal education are the most important predictors of under-five mortality. We found that deep learning techniques are superior to LR for the classification of child survival: LR sensitivity = 0.47, specificity = 0.53; DNN sensitivity = 0.69, specificity = 0.83; CNN sensitivity = 0.68, specificity = 0.83; CNN-DNN sensitivity = 0.71, specificity = 0.83.
Conclusion:
Our findings provide an understanding of interventions that needs to be prioritized, in order to reduce levels of U5M in LMICs. It also demonstrates that deep learning models are more efficacious than a traditional analytical approach.","/content/10.1101/19007583v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007583v1.full.pdf","2019-09-25","Public and Global Health

"Towards accurate and unbiased imaging based differentiation of Parkinson's Disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Corticobasal Syndrome","The early and accurate differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders is still a significant challenge for clinicians. In recent years, a number of studies have used MRI data combined with machine learning and statistical classifiers to successfully differentiate between different forms of Parkinsonism. However, several questions and methodological issues remain, to minimise bias and artefact-driven classification. In this study we compared different approaches for feature selection, as well as different MRI modalities, with well matched patient groups and tightly controlling for data quality issues related to patient motion. Our sample was drawn from a cohort of 69 healthy controls, and patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n=35, PD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Richardson's syndrome (n=52, PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (n=36, CBS). Participants underwent standardised T1-weighted MPRAGE and diffusion-weighted MRI. We compared two different methods for feature selection and dimensionality reduction: whole-brain principal components analysis, and an anatomical region-of-interest based approach. In both cases, support vector machines were used to construct a statistical model for pairwise classification of healthy controls and patients. The accuracy of each model was estimated using a leave-two-out cross-validation approach, as well as an independent validation using a different set of subjects. Our cross-validation results suggest that using principal components analysis (PCA) for feature extraction provides higher classification accuracies when compared to a region-of-interest based approach. However, the differences between the two feature extraction methods were significantly reduced when an independent sample was used for validation, suggesting that the principal components analysis approach may be more vulnerable to overfitting with cross-validation. Both T1-weighted and diffusion MRI data could be used to successfully differentiate between subject groups, with neither modality outperforming the other across all pairwise comparisons in the cross-validation analysis. However, features obtained from diffusion MRI data resulted in significantly higher classification accuracies when an independent validation cohort was used. Overall, our results support the use of statistical classification approaches for differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders. However, classification accuracy can be affected by group size, age, sex and movement artifacts. With appropriate controls and out-of-sample cross validation, diagnostic biomarker evaluation including MRI based classifiers can be an important adjunct to clinical evaluation.","/content/10.1101/19007575v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007575v1.full.pdf","2019-09-25","Radiology and Imaging

"Information and genetic counselling for psychiatric risks in children with rare genomic disorders","Purpose: Genomic medicine has transformed the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Evidence of increased psychiatric comorbidity associated with genomic copy number and single nucleotide variants (CNV and SNV) may not be fully considered when providing genetic counselling. We explored parents' experiences of genetics services and how they obtained information concerning psychiatric manifestations.
Methods: Parents of children diagnosed with genomic variants completed an online survey exploring, (i) how they experienced the genetic diagnosis, and (ii) how they acquired information about psychiatric, developmental and physical manifestations.
Results: Two-hundred and 86 respondents completed the survey. Thirty percent were unsatisfied with receiving genetic diagnoses. Satisfaction was predicted if communication was by geneticists (p = 0.004); provided face-to-face (p = 0.003); clearly explained (p < 0.001); and accompanied by support (p = 0.017). Parents obtained psychiatric information from non-professional sources more often than developmental (f 0.26, p < 0.001) and physical manifestations (f 0.21, p = 0.003), which mostly came from health professionals. Information from support organisations was more helpful than from geneticists (odds ratio [OR] 21.0, 95% CI 5.1 - 86.8, p < 0.001); paediatricians (OR 11.0, 1.4 - 85.2, p = 0.004); and internet sites (OR 15.5, 3.7 - 64.8, p < 0.001).
Conclusion: A paucity of professional information about psychiatric risks after genetic diagnosis may impede early diagnosis and intervention for children with high genotypic risks. Planned integration of genomic testing into mainstream services should include genetic counselling training to address the full spectrum of developmental, physical and psychiatric manifestations and timely provision of high-quality information.","/content/10.1101/19007294v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007294v1.full.pdf","2019-09-25","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

Methods: One hundred and thirty two microscopy confirmed patients were randomly allocated (ratio 1:1) to two groups, terbinafine (T) and terbinafine plus griseofulvin (T+G). Doses given were as follows: T, oral terbinafine (6 mg/kg/day, maximum 500 mg/day, once daily); T+G, terbinafine (as above) plus oral griseofulvin (children [<18 years] 10 mg/kg/day, adults [18 years or more] 10 mg/kg/day, but not <500 mg and not >1000 mg per day, in two divided doses). Patients were treated for 8 weeks or cure, whichever occurred earlier.
Results: At 4 weeks, none of the patients were cured in both groups. At 6 weeks, 1(1.5%) and 4 (6.1%) patients were cured in T and T+G groups, respectively (P=0.417). At 8 weeks, 17 (25.8%) and 19 (28.8%) patients were cured in T and T+G groups, respectively (P=0.845). For cure rate at 8 weeks, number needed to treat (NNT) for T+G (versus T), was 33. 
Conclusions: Addition of griseofulvin to terbinafine does not increase effectiveness of terbinafine in current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India.","/content/10.1101/19007617v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007617v1.full.pdf","2019-09-25","Dermatology

"A Genome-Wide Association Study of the Frailty Index Highlights Synaptic Pathways in Aging","Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome, strongly associated with disability, mortality and hospitalisation. The mechanisms underlying frailty are multifactorial and not well understood, but a genetic basis has been suggested with heritability estimates between 19 and 45%. Understanding the genetic determinants and biological mechanisms underpinning frailty may help to delay or even prevent frailty. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a frailty index (FI) in European descent participants from UK Biobank (n=164,610, aged 60-70 years). FI calculation was based on 49 self-reported items on symptoms, disabilities and diagnosed diseases. We identified 26 independent genetic signals at 24 loci associated with the FI (p<5*10-8). Many of these loci have previously been associated with traits such as body mass index, cardiovascular disease, smoking, HLA proteins, depression and neuroticism; however, three appear to be novel. The estimated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability of the FI was 14% (0.14, SE 0.006). A genetic risk score for the FI, derived solely from the UK Biobank data, was significantly associated with FI in the Swedish TwinGene study (n=10,616, beta: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02-0.20, p=0.015). In pathway analysis, genes associated with synapse function were significantly enriched (p<3*10-6). We also used Mendelian randomization to identify modifiable traits and exposures that may affect the risk of frailty, with a higher educational attainment genetic risk score being associated with a lower risk of frailty. Risk of frailty is influenced by many genetic factors, including well-known disease risk factors and mental health, with particular emphasis on synapse maintenance pathways.","/content/10.1101/19007559v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007559v1.full.pdf","2019-09-25","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Estimates of the global burden of Japanese Encephalitis and the impact of vaccination from 2000-2015","Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne disease, known for its high death and disability rate among symptomatic cases. Many effective vaccines are available for JE, and the use of a recently developed and inexpensive vaccine has been increasing over the recent years particularly with Gavi support. Estimates of the local burden and the past impact of vaccination are therefore increasingly needed, but difficult due to the limitations of JE surveillance. In this study, we implemented a mathematical modelling method combined with age-stratifed case data which can overcome some of these limitations. We estimate in 2015 JE infections caused 100,308 cases (95%CI: 61,720 - 157,522) and 25,125 deaths (95%CI: 14,550 - 46,031), and that between 2000 and 2015 307,774 JE cases (95%CI: 167,442- 509,583) were averted due to vaccination. Our results highlight areas that could have the greatest benefit from starting vaccination or from scaling up existing programs and will be of use to support local and international policymakers in making vaccine allocation decisions.","/content/10.1101/19006940v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006940v1.full.pdf","2019-09-25","Epidemiology

"Systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between Epstein-Barr virus, Multiple Sclerosis, and other risk factors","Background: EBV infection is thought to play a central role in the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). If causal, it represents a target for interventions to reduce MS risk. Objective: To examine the evidence for interaction between EBV and other risk factors, and explore mechanisms via which EBV infection may influence MS risk. Methods: Pubmed was searched using the terms multiple sclerosis AND Epstein Barr virus, multiple sclerosis AND EBV, clinically isolated syndrome AND Epstein Barr virus and clinically isolated syndrome AND EBV. All abstracts were reviewed for possible inclusion. Results: 262 full-text papers were reviewed.  There was evidence of interaction on the additive scale between anti-EBV antibody titre and HLA genotype (AP 0.48, p<1x10-4; RERI 3.84, p<5x10-3; S 1.68, p=0.06). Previous IM was associated with increased OR of MS in HLA-DRB1*1501 positive but not HLA-DRB1*1501 negative persons. Smoking was associated with a greater risk of MS in those with high anti-EBV antibodies (OR 2.76) but not low anti-EBV antibodies (OR 1.16).  No interaction between EBV and risk factors was found on a multiplicative scale. Conclusions:  EBV appears to interact with at least some established MS risk factors. The mechanism via which EBV influences MS risk remains unknown.","/content/10.1101/19007450v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007450v1.full.pdf","2019-09-25","Neurology

"Anteroposterior balance reactions of children with and without cerebral palsy: a cross-sectional, observational study of children age 5-12 years.","Aim: To compare anterior and posterior standing balance reactions, as measured by single-stepping thresholds, of children with and without cerebral palsy (CP).

Method: Seventeen ambulatory children with CP and 28 typically developing children, all 5-12 years of age, were recruited for this cross-sectional, observational study. Balance reaction skill was quantified as anterior and posterior single-stepping thresholds, or the treadmill-induced perturbations that consistently elicited a step in that direction. In order to understand underlying mechanisms of between-group differences in stepping thresholds, dynamic stability was quantified using the minimum margin of stability. Ankle muscle activation latency, magnitude, and co-contraction were assessed with surface electromyography.

Results: We observed large between-group differences in anterior, but not posterior, thresholds. Between-group differences were most evident in older children, with typically developing children having larger anterior thresholds than those with CP. In response to near-threshold anterior perturbations, older typically developing children recovered from more instability than their CP peers. Older children had no between-group differences in ankle muscle activity.

Interpretation: The effects of CP on balance reactions are age- and direction-specific. In response to an anterior perturbation, older typically developing children recovered from more instability than their peers with CP.","/content/10.1101/19006585v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006585v1.full.pdf","2019-09-25","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Investigating the added value of biomarkers compared with self-reported smoking in predicting future e-cigarette use: Evidence from a longitudinal UK cohort study","Introduction
Biomarkers can be used to assess smoking behaviour more accurately and objectively than self-report. This study assessed the association between cotinine (a biomarker of smoke exposure) and later e-cigarette use among a population who were unexposed to e-cigarettes in youth.
Methods
Young people in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children took part in the study. We observed associations between cotinine at 15 years (measured between 2006 and 2008 before the wide availability of e-cigarettes) and self-reported ever use of e-cigarettes at 22 (measured between 2014 and 2015 when e-cigarettes were widely available) using logistic regression. A range of potential confounders were adjusted for (age, sex, body mass index, alcohol use and passive smoke exposure). Additionally, we adjusted for the young people's self-reported smoking status/history to explore potential misreporting and measurement error.
Results
In a sample of N=1,194 young people, cotinine levels consistent with active smoking at 15 years were associated with increased odds of e-cigarette ever use at 22 years (OR=7.24, 95% CI 3.29 to 15.93) even when self-reported active smoking status at age 16 (OR=3.14, 95% CI 1.32 to 7.48) and latent classes of smoking behaviour from 14 to 16 (OR=2.70, 95% CI 0.98 to 7.44) were included in the model. 
Conclusions
Cotinine levels consistent with smoking in adolescence were strongly associated with increased odds of later e-cigarette use, even after adjusting for reported smoking behaviour at age 16 and smoking transitions from 14 to 16.","/content/10.1101/19006247v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006247v1.full.pdf","2019-09-24","Epidemiology

"Genetics of Unexplained Sudden Cardiac Death in Adult Caucasian and African American Individuals Living in the State of Maryland","Background: Unexplained-sudden cardiac death (SCD) describes SCD with no cause identified after a comprehensive autopsy and toxicologic examination. Genetic testing helps to diagnose inherited cardiac diseases in unexplained-SCD, however, the relationship between pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants of inherited cardiomyopathies and primary electrical disorders (PED) and risk of unexplained-SCD in adults living the United States has never been systematically examined.
Methods: We performed sequencing of 29 cardiomyopathy and 39 arrhythmia genes in 413 African-Americans and Caucasians (>18 years-old) who died of unexplained-SCD (median age; 41 years-old, 37% females, 50% African-Americans) and whose hearts were found to have no gross pathological finding upon referral to our institution for pathologic consultation from the State of Maryland Medical Examiner. We examined P/LP variants in these genes to study the association between presence of these variants and unexplained-SCD.
Results: 143/413 (34.6%) subjects had variants considered P/LP for cardiomyopathy and/or PED (i.e. Brugada Syndrome (BrS), long QT syndrome (LQTS), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)).  In total, 102 (24.7%) subjects harbored 86 P/LP variants for cardiomyopathies and 60 (14.5%) subjects carried 76 P/LP variants for PED.  The following pathogenic variants were identified: 68 P/LP variants for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in 79/413 (19.1%) subjects, 18 P/LP variants for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 22/413 subjects (5.3%), and 76 P/LP variants in 60/413 (14.5%) for PED.  There were greater than 121.0- and 138.5- fold median enrichments (431.4- and 200.0- fold cumulative enrichments) in these cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia variants in victims of unexplained SCD versus the general population, respectively.  Among these P/LP positive carriers, combinations of conditions were found, including 14/413 (2.4%) having both HCM and PED variants, and 5/413 (1.2%) with DCM and PED variants.  African Americans (AA) and Caucasians were equally likely to harbor P/LP variants (32.7% versus 36.6%, p=0.5), but AA had a higher frequent variants of unknown significance. 
Conclusions: This study represents the largest examination reported on the association between cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia P/LP genetic variants and unexplained-SCD in adults with no gross abnormality on rigorous pathological examination.  Nearly one-third of those with unexplained-SCD were carriers of P/LP variants.  Our findings with respect to both the association of unexplained SCD with cardiomyopathy genes and race-specific genetic variants suggest new avenues of study for this poorly understood entity.","/content/10.1101/19007344v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007344v1.full.pdf","2019-09-23","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Clinical Trial Evidence Supporting FDA Approval of Novel Therapeutic Agents Over Three Decades, 1995-2017: Cross-Sectional Analysis","Objective: To evaluate whether characteristics of pivotal efficacy trials supporting US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of novel therapeutic agents have changed over the past three decades.
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Setting and population: Publicly available data on novel therapeutics approved by the FDA between 1995-1997, 2005-2007, and 2015-2017.
Main outcome measures: Use of randomization, blinding, types of comparators and primary endpoints, number of treated patients, and trial duration in pivotal trials supporting novel therapeutic approval, both individually and aggregated by each indication approval. Analyses were repeated stratifying by use of orphan designation and use of special regulatory programs.
Results: There were 273 novel therapeutics approved by the FDA in these 3 periods (107 in 1995-1997, 57 in 2005-2007, 109 in 2015-2017), representing 339 indications (157, 64, and 118, respectively). Overall, the proportion of indication approvals supported by at least 2 pivotal trials decreased (80.6% in 1995-1997, 60.3% in 2005-2007, 52.8% in 2015-2017; p<0.001). The proportion supported by only single-arm pivotal trials increased (4.0% in 1995-1997, 12.7% in 2005-2007, 17.0% in 2015-2017; p=0.001), as did the proportion supported by at least one pivotal trial of 6 months duration (25.8% in 1995-1997, 34.9% in 2005-2007, 46.2% in 2015-2017; p=0.001). When stratified by use of special regulatory programs, pivotal trial characteristics changed over time in divergent ways, both individually and when aggregated by indication approvals. 
Conclusion: More recent FDA approvals of novel therapeutics were based on fewer pivotal trials, with less rigorous designs but longer trial durations. These findings reinforce the importance of the FDA's strategy for requiring ongoing evaluation of therapeutic safety and efficacy after approval.","/content/10.1101/19007047v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007047v1.full.pdf","2019-09-23","Health Policy

"Epigenomic prediction of cardiovascular disease risk and interactions with traditional risk metrics","Epigenome-wide association studies for cardiometabolic risk factors have discovered multiple loci associated with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, few studies have sought to directly optimize a predictor of CVD risk. Furthermore, it is challenging to train multivariate models across multiple studies in the presence of study- or batch effects. Here, we analyzed existing DNA methylation data collected using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 microarray to create a predictor of CVD risk across three cohorts: Women's Health Initiative, Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort, and Lothian Birth Cohorts. We trained Cox proportional hazards-based elastic net regressions for incident CVD separately in each cohort, and used a recently-introduced cross-study learning approach to integrate these individual predictions into an ensemble predictor. The methylation-based risk score (MRS) predicted CVD time-to-event in a held-out fraction of the Framingham dataset (HR per SD = 1.28, p = 2e-3) and predicted myocardial infarction status in the independent REGICOR dataset (OR per SD = 2.14, p = 9e-7). These associations remained after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and were similar to those from elastic net models trained on a directly merged dataset. Additionally, we investigated interactions between the MRS and both genetic and biochemical CVD risk, showing preliminary evidence of an enhanced predictive power in those with less traditional risk factor elevation. This investigation provides proof-of-concept for a genome-wide, CVD-specific epigenomic risk score and suggests that the DNA methylation data may enable the discovery of high-risk individuals that would be missed by alternative risk metrics.","/content/10.1101/19006965v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006965v1.full.pdf","2019-09-23","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"medExtractR: A medication extraction algorithm for electronic health records using the R programming language","Objective: We developed medExtractR, a natural language processing system to extract medication dose and timing information from clinical notes. Our system facilitates creation of medication-specific research datasets from electronic health records.
Materials and Methods: Written using the R programming language, medExtractR combines lexicon dictionaries and regular expression patterns to identify relevant medication information ('drug entities'). The system is designed to extract particular medications of interest, rather than all possible medications mentioned in a clinical note. MedExtractR was developed on notes from Vanderbilt University's Synthetic Derivative, using two medications (tacrolimus and lamotrigine) prescribed with varying complexity, and with a third drug (allopurinol) used for testing generalizability of results. We evaluated medExtractR and compared it to three existing systems: MedEx, MedXN, and CLAMP.
Results: On 50 test notes for each development drug and 110 test notes for the additional drug, medExtractR achieved high overall performance (F-measures > 0.95). This exceeded the performance of the three existing systems across all drugs, with the exception of a couple specific entity-level evaluations including dose amount for lamotrigine and allopurinol.
Discussion: MedExtractR successfully extracted medication entities for medications of interest. High performance in entity-level extraction tasks provides a strong foundation for developing robust research datasets for pharmacological research. However, its targeted approach provides a narrower scope compared with existing systems.
Conclusion: MedExtractR (available as an R package) achieved high performance values in extracting specific medications from clinical text, leading to higher quality research datasets for drug-related studies than some existing general-purpose medication extraction tools.","/content/10.1101/19007286v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007286v1.full.pdf","2019-09-23","Health Informatics

"Use of consensus term and definition for delayed cerebral ischaemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage","Background and purpose:  In 2010, a multidisciplinary research group proposed a consensus term and definition for the complication of delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). We assessed the use of this term and its definition as an endpoint in observational studies and clinical trials.
Methods:  Firstly, we performed a MEDLINE abstract search from Jan 2008 to Dec 2017 for observational cohort studies and clinical trials to investigate the used terminology over the years. Next, we studied trends in citations of the original paper citing the consensus definitions since publication in 2010.
Results:  The number of publications citing the 2010 consensus definitions has steadily increased from 18 in 2011 to 54 in 2017. Between 2010 and 2017, 527 papers were published with delayed cerebral ischemia, or another term to describe the same complication, as an endpoint. However, the term delayed cerebral ischemia was used only in 131/527 (25%) of papers and only 14/81 (17%) of clinical trials/cohort studies published in 2017 cited the consensus definitions when outlining study endpoints.
Conclusions:  Despite publication of consensus terminology and definitions for DCI in 2010, the majority of cohort studies and clinical trials in patients with SAH are not using these. Researchers and editors should be reminded of the importance of using these consensus terminology and definitions in future studies, which will promote the comparability of results between studies, understand the true impact of an intervention, aggregate results in meta- analyses, and construct guidelines with a high level of evidence.","/content/10.1101/19007260v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007260v1.full.pdf","2019-09-23","Neurology

"Neonatal platelet count trends during inhaled nitric oxide therapy","Recent debate has focused on the significance of platelets generated in lung tissue. Here, we retrospectively analyzed platelet count changes in neonates requiring inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) pulmonary vasodilation therapy for pulmonary hypertension. There were no clinically significant changes in platelet count upon iNO initiation or during iNO therapy. Unexpectedly, platelet counts increased after iNO cessation. These findings argue against a clinically meaningful untapped pulmonary repository of megakaryocytes and platelets in this context, although acute platelet count increases might be expected after discontinuing iNO in some patients. Further work is needed to clarify the underlying etiology for these observations, and to better delineate the mechanisms for platelet count increases after recovery from lung injury.","/content/10.1101/19007229v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007229v1.full.pdf","2019-09-23","Hematology

"Neuropsychological stratification of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: building affect into clinically relevant neuro-biomarkers of breathlessness","Background: Chronic breathlessness profoundly affects quality of life for its sufferers. Often, reported breathlessness is inconsistent with airway pathophysiology and objective disease markers. While a mechanistic understanding of this discordance has thus far remained elusive, factors such as mood, attention and expectation have all been implicated as important perceptual modulators. Therefore, here we have developed a model capable of exploring these relationships aiding patient stratification and revealing clinically-relevant neuro-biomarkers.
Methods: A cohort of 100 participants with mild-to-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) underwent a comprehensive assessment that included functional brain imaging while viewing and rating breathlessness-related word cues, self-report questionnaires and clinical measures. 
Results: Using an exploratory factor analysis across psychological and physiological measures, we identified two distinctive neuropsychological behavioural profiles that differed across four key factors corresponding to mood, symptom burden, and two capability measures. These profiles stratified participants into high and low symptom groups, which did not differ in spirometry values. The low symptom load group demonstrated greater FMRI activity to breathlessness-related word cues in the anterior insula. 
Conclusions: Our findings reveal two clear groups of individuals within our COPD cohort, divided by behavioural rather than clinical factors. Furthermore, indices of depression, anxiety, vigilance and perceived capability were linked to differences in brain activity within key regions thought to be involved in monitoring bodily sensations (interoception). These findings demonstrate the complex relationship between affect and interoceptive processing, providing the foundations for the development of targeted treatment programmes that harness clinical and symptom-relevant biomarkers.","/content/10.1101/19006684v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006684v1.full.pdf","2019-09-23","Respiratory Medicine

"Efficacy and safety of erythropoietin for traumatic brain injury: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","Objective
Recent studies regarding the effects of erythropoietin (EPO) for treating traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been inconsistent. This study conducts a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the safety and efficacy of EPO for TBI patients at various follow-up time points. 
Methods
A literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library for RCTs studying EPO in TBI patients published through March 2019. Non-English manuscripts and non-human studies were excluded. The assessed outcomes include mortality, neurological recovery and associated adverse effects. Dichotomous variables are presented as risk ratios (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). 
Results
A total of seven RCTs involving 1197 TBI patients were included in this study. Compared to the placebo arm, treatment with EPO did not improve acute hospital mortality or short-term mortality. However, there was a significant improvement in mid-term (6 months) follow-up survival rates. EPO administration was not associated with neurological function improvement. Regarding adverse effects, EPO treatment did not increase the incidence of thromboembolic events or other associated adverse events.
Conclusions 
This meta-analysis indicates a slight mortality benefit for TBI patients treated with EPO at mid-term follow-up. EPO does not improve in-hospital mortality, nor does it increase adverse events including thrombotic, cardiovascular and other associated complications. Our analysis did not demonstrate a significant beneficial effect of EPO intervention on the recovery of neurological function. Future RCTs are required to further characterize the use of EPO in TBI.

"Self-reported Morisky 8 item medication adherence scale to statins concords with pill count method and correlates with serum lipid profile parameters and Serum HMGCoA Reductase levels","Background: It is imperative that non-compliance to statins be identified and addressed to optimize the clinical benefit of statins. Patient self-reporting methods are convenient to apply in clinical practice but need to be validated. 
Objective: We studied the concordance of a patient self-report method, MMAS (Morisky eight item medication adherence scale) with pill count method in measuring adherence to statins and their correlation with extended lipid profile parameters and serum HMGCoA-R (hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) enzyme levels.
Methods: MMAS and pill count method were used to measure the adherence to statins in patients on statins for any duration. Patients were subjected to estimation of extended lipid profile and serum HMGCoA-R levels at the end of 3 months follow-up.
Results: Out of a total of 200 patients included in the study, 117 patients had low adherence (score less than 6 on MMAS) whereas 65 and 18 patients had medium (score 6 to less than 8) and high adherence (score of 8) respectively. Majority of patients who had low adherence to statins by MMAS were nonadherent by pill count method yielding concordance of 96.5%. Medium or high adherence to statins by MMAS method had concordance of 89.1% with pill count method. The levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein- cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and HMGCoA-R were significantly negatively correlated with compliance measured by pill count and MMAS with similar correlation coefficients. HMGCoA-R levels demonstrated a plateau phenomenon with levels being 9-10 ng/ml when compliance to statin therapy was greater than 60% by pill count and greater than 6 on Morisky scale.
Conclusion: In conclusion, MMAS and pill count methods showed concordance in measuring adherence to statins. These methods need to be explored further for their interchangeability as surrogates for biomarker levels.","/content/10.1101/19006148v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006148v1.full.pdf","2019-09-23","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Excess Pneumonia Mortality During a Legionnaires' Disease Outbreak in Flint, Michigan","Introduction: From June 2014-October 2015, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) reported a Legionnaires' disease (LD) outbreak in Genesee County, Michigan, of which Flint is the county seat. MDHHS' final case count for the outbreak was 90 cases, including 10 deaths among Genesee County residents. As LD is not routinely tested for as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia, the size of the outbreak may have been underestimated. Specifically, some LD cases may have been classified as pneumonias of other or unexplained etiologies.

Objective: To estimate excess pneumonia deaths in Genesee County during the 2014-15 LD outbreak and compare this with reported LD death tolls.

Methods: We used data from the CDC WONDER database, which contains monthly county-level counts of death certificates, on all pneumonia deaths among residents of Genesee and a set of similar counties from 2011-2017. We calculated excess pneumonia deaths in Genesee during the period of the LD outbreak (May 2014-October 2015). We used data from the Genesee County Vital Records Division to map pneumonia deaths by census tract to assess geographic overlap with reported LD cases. 

Results: We estimated 70.0 excess pneumonia deaths (90% uncertainty interval (UI): 36 to 103) in Genesee County during the LD outbreak. This is substantially higher than the 10 LD deaths among Genesee County residents reported by MDHHS. Areas of high pneumonia mortality overlapped with those with high LD incidence and were primarily located in western Flint and northwestern non-Flint Genesee County.

Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the LD outbreak was larger than reported. Earlier detection and response to this outbreak may have facilitated identification of these additional cases.","/content/10.1101/19005942v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005942v1.full.pdf","2019-09-23","Epidemiology

"Rate and predictors of Treatment Failure among pediatric population taking Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy in Ethiopia","Background: Though the unprecedented global effort at scaling up universal access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has decreased the progression of HIV, treatment failure (TF) among pediatric patients receiving ART against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is becoming a global public health concern which may impact on treatment outcome. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the rate and predictors of treatment failure (TF) among HIV-infected pediatric patients taking ART in Ethiopia. Methods: A prospective and retrospective follow-up study was conducted from March 2016 to 2017. Retrospective clinical and laboratory data were captured from patients medical record.  Socio-demographics and explanatory variables of participants were collected using pre-tested structured questionnaire and study participants were followed for three to six month after baseline viral load has been done to classify virologic failure (VF). TF was ascertained from population who virally failed with the denominator of population taking ART. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regressions were conducted to assess predictors TF. Statistical significance was set at P-value less than 0.05. Results: A total of 554 pediatrics patients taking ART from 40 selected health facilities were included in the study. Viral load suppression (VLS) (VL<1000 copies/ml) among pediatric population taking ART in Ethiopia were found to be 344 (62.1%). From those who was not virally suppressed at baseline of the study 210 (37.9%), 99 (51.6%) were re-suppressed after  three to six month of enhanced adherence and counseling, leading the overall virologic failure (VF) among pediatric population taking ART in Ethiopia to be 93 (17.3%). The mean CD4 count was improved from 490 cells/ml at ART initiation to 921 cells/ml after 80 months of ART exposure. Moreover, the clinical outcome was improved from 42% to 89% at ART initiation and after 80 month of ART experience. CD4 count, clinical stage, Hemoglobin and weight were found to be predictors of VF. Moreover; family HIV and disclosure status, duration on ART, age, being orphan, stigma and medication adherence have significant association with VF. Conclusions: The low level of VLS (62.1%) and the high level of VF (18.3%) could explain the challenge on the national ART program among pediatric population. The significant improvement on immunologic and clinical outcome could indicate the success of ART on treatment outcome among pediatric population. CD4 count, clinical stage, Hemoglobin and weight could be good predictors of TF among pediatric population. Improving disclosure status, stigma and medication adherence could improve the treatment outcome of pediatric population taking ART in Ethiopia.","/content/10.1101/19005538v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005538v1.full.pdf","2019-09-23","HIV/AIDS

"Bayesian estimation of IVW and MR-Egger models for two-sample Mendelian randomization studies","We present our package, mrbayes, for the open source software environment R. The package implements
Bayesian estimation of IVW and MR-Egger models, including the radial MR-Egger model, for
summary-level data Mendelian randomization analyses. We have implemented a choice of prior distributions
for the model parameters, namely; weakly informative, non-informative, a joint prior for the
MR-Egger model slope and intercept, and a pseudo-horseshoe prior, or the user can specify their own
prior. We show how to use the package through an applied example investigating the causal effect of
BMI on insulin resistance. In future work, we plan to provide functions for alternative MCMC estimation

"Generating Evidence for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Clinical Guidelines Using EHR Data","Objectives: The aim of this research was to develop data-driven models using electronic health records (EHRs) to conduct clinical studies for predicting clinical outcomes through probabilistic analysis that considers temporal aspects of clinical data. We assess the efficacy of antibiotics treatment and the optimal time of initiation for in-hospitalized diagnosed with acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) as an application to probabilistic modeling.

Materials and Methods: We developed a semi-automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modeling and simulation approach that encodes clinical conditions as computable definitions of health states and exact time duration as input for parameter estimations using raw EHR data. We applied the MCMC approach to the MIMIC-III clinical database, where ICD-9 diagnosis codes (491.21, 491.22, and 494.1) were used to identify data for 697 AECOPD patients of which 25.9% were administered antibiotics.

Results: The average time to antibiotic administration was 27 hours, and 32% of patients were administered vancomycin as the initial antibiotic. The model simulations showed a 50% decrease in mortality rate as the number of patients administered antibiotics increased. There was an estimated 5.5% mortality rate when antibiotics were initially administrated after 48 hours vs 1.8% when antibiotics were initially administrated between 24 and 48 hours. 

Discussion: Our findings suggest that there may be a mortality benefit in initiation of antibiotics early in patient with severe respiratory failure in settings of COPD exacerbations warranting an ICU admission. 

Conclusion: Probabilistic modeling and simulation methods that considers temporal aspects of raw clinical patient data can be used to adequately generate evidence for clinical guidelines.","/content/10.1101/19006023v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006023v1.full.pdf","2019-09-20","Respiratory Medicine

"Genome-wide association and multi-omic analyses reveal new mechanisms for Heart Failure","Heart failure is a major medical and economic burden in the healthcare system affecting over 23 million people worldwide. Although recent pedigree studies estimate heart failure heritability around 26%, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have had limited success in explaining disease pathogenesis. We conducted the largest meta-analysis of heart failure GWAS to-date and replicated our findings in a comparable sized cohort to identify one known and two novel variants associated with heart failure. Leveraging heart failure sub-phenotyping and fine-mapping, we reveal a putative causal variant found in a cardiac muscle specific regulatory region that binds to the ACTN2 cardiac sarcolemmal gene and affects left ventricular adverse remodeling and clinical heart failure in response to different initial cardiac muscle insults. Via genetic correlation, we show evidence of broadly shared heritability between heart failure and multiple musculoskeletal traits. Our findings extend our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying heart failure.","/content/10.1101/19006510v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006510v2.full.pdf","2019-09-20","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"A polygenic predictor of treatment-resistant depression using whole exome sequencing and genome-wide genotyping","Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) occurs in ~30% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) but the genetics of TRD was previously poorly investigated. Whole exome sequencing and genome-wide genotyping were performed in 1320 MDD patients. Response to the first pharmacological treatment was compared to non-response to one treatment and non-response to two or more treatments (TRD). Differences in the risk of carrying damaging variants were tested. A score expressing the burden of variants in genes and pathways was calculated weighting each variant for its functional (Eigen) score and frequency, considering rare variants only and rare + common variants. Gene- and pathway-based scores were used to develop predictive models of TRD and non-response using gradient boosting in 70% of the sample (training) which were tested in the remaining 30% (testing), evaluating also the addition of clinical predictors. Independent replication was tested in STAR*D and GENDEP using exome array-based data. After quality control 1209 subjects were included. TRD and non-responders did not show higher risk to carry damaging variants compared to responders. Genes/pathways associated with TRD included those modulating cell survival and proliferation, neurodegeneration and immune response. Significant prediction of TRD vs. response was observed in the testing sample which was improved by the addition of clinical factors. Some models were replicated, with a weaker prediction, in STAR*D and GENDEP when considering also clinical factors and in the extremes of the genetic score distribution. These results suggested relevant biological mechanisms implicated in TRD and a new methodological approach to the prediction of TRD.","/content/10.1101/19007161v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007161v1.full.pdf","2019-09-20","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Machine learning based prediction of antibiotic sensitivity in patients with critical illness","Rising antibiotic resistance inflicts a heavy burden on healthcare, both clinically and economically. Owing to the time required to obtain culture and sensitivity test results, quite often the clinicians rely on their experience and static clinical guidelines to prescribe antibiotics. Such empirical treatment often fails to account for patient-specific attributes and changes in the antibiotic resistance patterns with time and location. The aim of this study was to analyze the patient and hospital specific features regarding their prognostic relevance to treat bacterial infections of patients in the intensive care units (ICUs). We performed a single-center retrospective cohort analysis across 25526 positive cultures recorded in MIMIC-III critical care database. We retrieved a number of clinically relevant relationships from association analysis between patient factors and bacterial strains. For instance, higher elapsed time from patient admission to sample collection for culture showed strong association with blood stream infection caused by Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus, indicating that these infections are possibly hospital acquired. To predict antibiotic sensitivity at the level of individual patients we developed an ensemble of machine learning algorithms. The model provided superior prediction accuracy (about 87%) and area under the ROC curve (around 0.91 on an average) for the four most common sample types as compared to a number of off-the-shelf techniques. We demonstrate the predictive power of commonly recorded patient attributes in personalised prediction of antibiotic efficacy.","/content/10.1101/19007153v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007153v1.full.pdf","2019-09-20","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"STOP-Bang questionnaire should be used in all adults with Down Syndrome to screen for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea","Abstract
Study Objectives
To determine the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults with Down syndrome (DS), to investigate factors related to OSA severity and to identify which sleep questionnaire is the most appropriate for the screening of OSA in this population.
Methods
Cross-sectional study that consecutively included 60 adults with DS. All patients underwent type III polysomnography and clinical and laboratory data were collected; sleep assessment questionnaires were applied. Multiple linear regression models evaluated the associations between OSA severity (measured by the respiratory event index - REI) and clinical and laboratory data and sleep questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, BERLIN and STOP-Bang questionnaires).
Results
Results show that 60 (100%) adults with DS had OSA, with moderate-severe OSA identified in 49 (81.6%). At the multivariate linear regression, REI significantly correlated with hematocrit levels, BMI and STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ) results (P <0.001). The positive STOP-Bang =3 points) showed 100% of sensitivity (95%CI: 92.75-100%), 45.45% of specificity (95%CI: 16.75-76.62), positive predictive value of 89.09% (95%CI: 82.64-93.34%), negative predictive value of 100%, accuracy of 90% (95%CI: 79.49-96.24%) and OR of 24.29.
Conclusions
Adults with DS have a very high prevalence of OSA. Hematocrit levels, BMI and SBQ showed a strong correlation with OSA severity. The SBQ performed well in identifying moderate to severe OSA in this population. Considered together, these results point to the need to perform OSA screening in all adults with DS, and STOP-Bang may play a role in this screening.

"A rapid review of patient and family perspectives on inappropriateness of intensive care treatments at the end of life","Aim
To understand patient/family perspective of inappropriate intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and treatment.

Methods
Rapid literature review of English language articles published between 2001 and 2017 in Medline or PsycInfo. 

Results
Thirteen articles covering 6,194 elderly patients or surrogate decision-makers from four countries were eligible. Perceived inappropriateness of ICU treatments was mainly expressed as dissatisfaction with clinicians as surrogate decision-makers, inconsistency with patient/family values, family distrust of physicians predictions on poor prognosis, and inadequate communication on over-aggressive treatment causing suffering. Consultation on opinion before ICU admission varied from 1% to 53.6%, and treatment goals from 1.4 to 31.7%. Satisfaction with the decision-making process in ICU was higher for those who had certain level of control and involvement in the process.  

Conclusions 
The patient/family perspective on inappropriateness of ICU treatments involves preferences, values and social constructs beyond medical criteria. Earlier consultation with families before ICU admission, and patient education on outcomes of life-sustaining therapies may help reconcile these provider-patient disagreements.   

Keywords: professional-patient relations, intensive care, end-of-life, review.

Take-home message

The patient/family perspective on inappropriateness of ICU at the end of life often differs from the clinicians opinion due to the non-medical frame of mind. To improve satisfaction with communication on treatment goals, consultation on patient values and inclusion of social constructs in addition to clinical prediction are a good start to reconcile differences between physician and health service users viewpoint.","/content/10.1101/19007138v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007138v1.full.pdf","2019-09-20","Geriatric Medicine

"Prospective metrological validation of multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis against volumetric imaging to identify sarcopenia in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.","Importance: Depleted skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia) is associated with decreased survival and cancer control in head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. There is a need for validated measures of body composition that can be implemented in routine clinical workflow.
Objective: To validate the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for body composition analysis and diagnosis of sarcopenia in head and neck cancer patients.
Design: In this prospective observational cohort study, baseline 50 patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy (RT) were enrolled between February 2016 and March 2017. Baseline BIA measures of skeletal muscle (SM) mass, fat-free mass (FMM), and fat mass (FM) were compared to CT-based estimates of body composition using linear regression. Sex-specific BIA-derived thresholds for sarcopenia were defined by the maximum Youden Index on receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves of BIA against CT-defined sarcopenia. Changes in body composition across treatment were compared against changes in body weight using linear regression.
Participants: In total, 50 patients with pathologically confirmed stage I to IVB non-metastatic head and neck cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy were enrolled.
Setting: Single academic referral center.
Main Outcome and Measure: The primary outcome was relative agreement between baseline lean body mass and fat body mass predicted from BIA measurement and CT imaging.
Results: Of the 48 evaluable patients 16 (33.3%) were sarcopenic at baseline based on CT analysis. BIA measures of body composition were strongly correlated with CT measures: SM mass (r = 0.97; R2 = 0.94; p < 0.0001), FFM (r = 0.97; R2 = 0.94; p < 0.0001) and FM (r = 0.95; R2 = 0.90; p < 0.0001). Relationship with normalized indices of SM mass, FFM, and FM was similar between BIA and CT, but not BIA and body mass index (BMI). Patients lost a mean of 5.7 +/- 5.8 kg during treatment, of which 1.5 +/- 1.9 kg was SM, 2.6 +/- 3.3 kg was FFM, and 2.2 +/- 2.6 kg was FM. Eight additional patients developed sarcopenia by the end of RT.
Conclusions: BIA provides accurate estimates of body composition in head and neck cancer patients. Implementation of BIA in clinical practice may identify patients with sarcopenia.

"Investigating the clinico-anatomical dissociation in the behavioral variant of Alzheimer's disease","Objective: We previously found temporoparietal â€œAlzheimer-typicalâ€ atrophy in patients with the behavioral variant of Alzheimer's disease (bvAD) with relative sparing of frontal regions. Here, we aimed to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of bvAD based on alternative neuroimaging markers.	 
Methods: We retrospectively included 150 participants at the University of California San Francisco and University of Berkeley, including 29 bvAD, 28 â€œtypicalâ€ amnestic-predominant AD (tAD), 28 behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and 65 cognitively normal participants. Patients with bvAD were compared with other groups on glucose metabolism and metabolic connectivity on [18F]FDG-PET, and subcortical gray matter volumes and white matter hyperintensity volumes (WMHV) on MRI. A receiver-operating-characteristic-analysis was performed to determine the measures yielding the highest contrast between groups. 	
Results: bvAD and tAD showed predominant temporoparietal hypometabolism compared to controls, and did not differ in direct contrasts. However, overlaying statistical maps from contrasts between patients and controls revealed broader frontoinsular hypometabolism in bvAD compared to tAD, partially overlapping with bvFTD. Metabolic connectivity analyses indicated greater anterior default mode network (DMN) involvement in bvAD compared to tAD, mimicking bvFTD. Analyses of subcortical volume and WMHV showed no relevant group differences. The top-3 discriminative measures for bvAD vs. bvFTD were: metabolism in posterior (bvAD<bvFTD), anterior DMN (bvAD>bvFTD) and parietal cortex (bvAD<bvFTD; AUC: 0.80-0.91, p<0.01), while the top-3 discriminators for bvAD vs. tAD were amygdalar volume (bvAD>tAD), anterior DMN (bvAD<tAD) and salience network metabolism (bvAD<tAD; AUC: 0.66-0.75, p<0.05). 
Conclusion: Subtle frontoinsular hypometabolism and anterior DMN involvement may underlie the prominent behavioral phenotype in bvAD.","/content/10.1101/19006676v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006676v1.full.pdf","2019-09-20","Neurology

We conducted logistic regression analyses within a Difference-in-Difference framework and adjusted for age, sex, a marker of deprivation and survey weighting for non-response.  Among children aged 13-15 years, self-reported levels of regular exposure to smoke in cars were 3.4% in 2012, 2.2% in 2014 and 1.3% in 2016 for Scotland and 6.3%, 5.9% and 1.6% in England.

"Nothing About Us Without Us: A Scoping Review and Priority-Setting Partnership in Type 1 Diabetes and Exercise","Objectives: Examine the characteristics of patient engagement (PE) practices in exercise-based randomized trials in type 1 diabetes (T1D), and facilitate T1D stakeholders in determining the top ten list of priorities for exercise research.
Design: Two methodological approaches were employed: a scoping review and a modified James Lind Alliance priority-setting partnership.
Methods: Published (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Central databases) and grey literature (www.clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to identify randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions lasting minimum four weeks and available in English. We extracted information on PE and patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) to identify if patient perspectives had been implemented. Based on results, we set out to determine exercise research priorities as a first step towards a patient-engaged research agenda. An online survey was distributed across Canada to collect research questions from patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. We qualitatively analyzed submitted questions and compiled a long-list that a twelve-person stakeholder steering committee used to identify the top ten priority research questions.
Results: Of 9,962 identified sources, 19 published trials and 4 trial registrations fulfilled inclusion criteria. No evidence of PE existed in any included study. Most commonly measured PROMs were frequency of hypoglycemia (n=7) and quality of life (n=4). The priority-setting survey yielded 194 submitted research questions. Steering committee rankings identified 10 priorities focused on lifestyle factors and exercise modifications to maintain short-term glycemic control. 
Conclusion: Recent exercise-based randomized trials in T1D have not included PE and PROMs. Patient priorities for exercise research have yet to be addressed with adequately designed clinical trials.","/content/10.1101/19006452v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006452v1.full.pdf","2019-09-20","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Predicting Cost-Effectiveness of Generic Versus Brand Dabigatran Using Pharmacometric Estimates among Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in the United States","Generic entry of newer anticoagulants is expected to decrease the costs of atrial fibrillation management. However, when making switches between brand and generic medications, bioequivalence failures are possible. The objectives of this study were to predict and compare the lifetime cost-effectiveness of brand dabigatran with hypothetical future generics. Markov micro-simulations were modified to predict the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years of patients on either brand or generic dabigatran from a U.S. private payer perspective. Event rates for generics were predicted using previously developed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models. The analyses showed that generic dabigatran with lower-than-brand systemic exposure was dominant. Meanwhile, generic dabigatran with extremely high systemic exposure was not cost-effective compared to the brand reference. Cost-effectiveness of generic medications cannot always be assumed as shown in this example. Combined use of pharmacometric and pharmacoeconomic models can assist in decision making between brand and generic pharmacotherapies.","/content/10.1101/19006346v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006346v1.full.pdf","2019-09-20","Pharmacology and Therapeutics

"Zika Virus Infection: Review Of Neuroimage Studies And The Relationship Between Findings And Time Of Infection","AIM: To conduct a systematic literature review on neuroimage findings in children with microcephaly by Zika virus (ZIKV). 
METHOD: We performed a literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science for full-text articles reporting neuroimage exam of computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. 
RESULTS: Were identified 2,214 publications. Of these 2,170 were excluded by the analysis of titles and abstracts, resulting in 7 articles included. The abnormalities presented in neuroimage showed the highest occurrence in the first trimester: decreased brain volume + increased extra-axial CSF space (100%), subcortical calcifications (89.1%), microcephaly (89.1%), ventriculomegaly (72.9%), malformation of cortical development (40.5%), basal ganglia calcifications (40.5%), megacisterna magna (39.1%). In relation to the second trimester of ZIKV infection, the most common were as follows: decreased brain volume + increased extra-axial CSF space (100%), subcortical calcifications (100%), microcephaly (85.7%), ventriculomegaly (71.4%), malformation of cortical development (71.4%), basal ganglia calcifications (19%), megacisterna magna (4.7%). In relation to the neuroimage abnormalities detected in the 3rd trimester 2 cases were found.

"Does in utero HIV-exposure influence infant development and immune outcomes? Findings from a pilot study in Pretoria, South Africa.","HIV-infected infants show altered growth, brain development, and immune function. Yet, it remains unclear how detrimental fetal exposure to maternal HIV infection is to the development of the uninfected infant.  A pilot study was conducted at Kalafong Hospital in Pretoria, South Africa, to better understand how maternal HIV infection influences infant outcomes. We hypothesised that in utero HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU) infants would have poorer postnatal development and altered innate immune composition compared to HIV-unexposed, uninfected infants (HUU). Infant growth, neurodevelopment (Guide for Monitoring Child Development [GMCD]) and levels of monocyte subsets (CD14, CD16, and CCR2 expression [flow cytometry]) were measured in infants at birth and 12-weeks. HEU infants had lower head circumference and elevated CCR2+ (% and median fluorescence intensity) on monocytes at birth compared to HUU. Most infants met GMCD milestones at 1-3 and 3-5 months. Our findings that HEU infants had reduced head circumference and increased levels of migratory monocytes at birth, which has been associated with poor motor and cognitive outcomes, is consistent with our motor results within 5 months of age. Elevated levels of migratory monocytes may initiate pro-inflammatory pathways that target the brain, impacting neurodevelopment and lifelong health.","/content/10.1101/19003889v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003889v1.full.pdf","2019-09-20","HIV/AIDS

"A structured approach to evaluating life course hypotheses: Moving beyond analyses of exposed versus unexposed in the omics context","Background: Life course epidemiology provides a framework for studying the effects of time-varying exposures on health outcomes. The structured life course modeling approach (SLCMA) is a theory-driven analytic method that empirically compares multiple prespecified life course hypotheses characterizing time-dependent exposure-outcome relationships to determine which theory best fits the observed data. However, the statistical properties of inference methods used with the SLCMA have not been investigated with high-dimensional omics outcomes. 

Methods: We performed simulations and empirical analyses to evaluate the performance of the SLCMA when applied to genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm). In the simulations, we compared five statistical inference tests used by SLCMA (n=700).  For each, we assessed the familywise error rate (FWER), statistical power, and confidence interval coverage to determine whether inference based on these tests was valid in the presence of substantial multiple testing and small effect sizes, two hallmark challenges of inference from omics data. In the empirical analyses, we applied the SLCMA to evaluate the time-dependent relationship of childhood abuse with genome-wide DNAm (n=703). 

Results: In the simulations, selective inference and max-|t|-test performed best: both controlled FWER and yielded moderate statistical power. Empirical analyses using SLCMA revealed time-dependent effects of childhood abuse on DNA methylation. 

Conclusions: Our findings show that SLCMA, applied and interpreted appropriately, can be used in the omics setting to examine time-dependent effects underlying exposure-outcome relationships over the life course.  We provide recommendations for applying the SLCMA in high-throughput settings, which we hope will encourage researchers to move beyond analyses of exposed versus unexposed.","/content/10.1101/19007062v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007062v1.full.pdf","2019-09-19","Epidemiology

"Scaffolding the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Brain Using Transcranial Direct Current and Random Noise Stimulation","Background: Various methods have been attempted to effectively ameliorate psychiatric and neurological conditions in children and adults. One of the attractive ideas is to develop interventions to create a lasting, rather than only an immediate, effect. Such a concept has important implications including increased independency of the patient, reducing the load on the caregiver and the health system, and the economic burden at the micro and macro level. 
Methods: We used a randomized double-blind active-controlled crossover study of 19 unmedicated children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who completed five-day executive functions training while receiving either transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or random noise stimulation (tRNS). Both stimulation protocols have previously shown potential for inducing lasting benefits in adults, while tDCS was examined in multiple ADHD studies and has been highlighted as a promising method for treating neuropsychological deficits. 
Results: tRNS yielded a clinical improvement as indicated by the reduced ADHD rating scale (ADHD-RS) score from baseline, and in comparison to the changes observed in tDCS. Moreover, the effect of brain stimulation one week after completion of treatment yielded further improvement, suggesting a neuroplasticity-related effect. Finally, tRNS improved working memory compared to tDCS, and a larger tRNS effect on ADHD-RS was predicted for those patients who showed the greatest effect in working memory. 
Conclusions: Our results provide a promising direction toward a novel intervention in ADHD, which is shown to have a lasting effect via the modulating of neuroplasticity, rather than a merely immediate effect like in current medical interventions.","/content/10.1101/19005983v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005983v1.full.pdf","2019-09-19","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Symbolic transfer entropy reveals the age structure of pandemic influenza transmission from high-volume influenza-like illness data","Existing methods to infer the relative roles of age groups in epidemic transmission can normally only accommodate a few age classes, and/or require data that are highly specific for the disease being studied. Here, symbolic transfer entropy (STE), a measure developed to identify asymmetric transfer of information between stochastic processes, is presented as a way to determine which age groups drive an epidemic. STE provides a ranking of which age groups dominate transmission, rather than a reconstruction of the explicit between-age-group transmission matrix. Using simulations, we establish that STE can identify which age groups dominate transmission, even when there are differences in reporting rates between age groups and even if the data is noisy. Then, the pairwise STE is calculated between time series of influenza-like illness for 12 age groups in 884 US cities during the autumn of 2009. Elevated STE from 5-19 year-olds indicates that school-aged children were the most important transmitters of infection during the autumn wave of the 2009 pandemic in the US. The results may be partially confounded by higher rates of physician-seeking behaviour in children compared to adults, but it is unlikely that differences in reporting rates can explain the observed differences in STE.","/content/10.1101/19005710v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005710v1.full.pdf","2019-09-19","Epidemiology

"GWAS including 82,707 subjects identifies functional coding variant in OPRM1 gene associated with opioid use disorder","One way to address the current crisis in opioid use is to improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms of opioid use disorder (OUD). We completed a primary GWAS of electronic health record-defined OUD in European-ancestry participants in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) sample, which included 8,529 affected subjects and 71,200 opioid-exposed controls. In the MVP alone, there were no genome-wide significant (GWS) associations. We then subjected the MVP and additional OUD GWAS results from the Yale-Penn and SAGE samples to meta-analysis (in total, 10,544 OUD cases and 72,163 opioid-exposed controls). A functional coding variant (rs1799971, encoding Asn40Asp) in OPRM1 (mu opioid receptor gene, the main biological target for opioid drugs) reached GWS (p=1.51x10-8); then replicated in two independent samples (each at p<0.05). The final meta-analyzed p-value for this variant in all samples was 7.81x10-10. SNP-based heritability of OUD was 11.3%. OUD was genetically correlated with 83 traits, including multiple substance use traits, psychiatric illnesses, cognitive performance, and others. Mendelian Randomization revealed possible causal effects on OUD risk from tobacco smoking, major depression, neuroticism, and cognitive performance. Despite the inclusion of data from the MVP, discovery of a significant association depended on including other purpose-collected samples as well. Recruitment of additional opioid dependent subjects for future studies - especially of non-European ancestry - is a crucial next step.","/content/10.1101/19007039v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007039v1.full.pdf","2019-09-18","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Predicting individual clinical trajectories of depression with generative embedding","Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) show heterogeneous treatment response and highly variable clinical trajectories: while some patients experience swift and enduring recovery, others show relapsing-remitting or chronic disease course. Predicting individual clinical trajectories at an early disease stage is a key challenge for psychiatry and might facilitate individually tailored interventions. So far, however, reliable predictors at the single-patient level are absent. Here, we evaluated the utility of a machine learning strategy - generative embedding - which combines an interpretable generative model with a discriminative classifier. Specifically, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of emotional face perception in 85 MDD patients from the multi-site longitudinal NEtherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) who had been followed up over two years and classified into three subgroups with distinct clinical trajectories. Combining a generative model of effective (directed) connectivity with support vector machines (SVMs), it was possible to predict whether a given patient will experience chronic depression vs. fast remission with a balanced accuracy of 79%. Gradual improvement vs. fast remission could still be predicted above-chance, but less convincingly, with a balanced accuracy of 61%. Importantly, generative embedding outperformed conventional (descriptive) measures such as functional connectivity or local BOLD activity, which did not predict clinical trajectories with above-chance accuracy. Furthermore, the predictive performance of generative embedding could be assigned to a specific network property: the dynamic modulation of connections by the emotional content of the trial-by-trial stimuli. Our findings suggest that a mechanistically informed generative model of a neuronal circuit underlying emotional face perception may have predictive utility for distinguishing disease courses in MDD patients.","/content/10.1101/19006650v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006650v1.full.pdf","2019-09-18","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Physical activity and risk of breast and endometrial cancers: a Mendelian randomization study","Importance: The causality of the association between physical activity and risk of breast and endometrial cancers is uncertain because available evidence is based exclusively on observational studies, which are potentially susceptible to confounding and reverse causation. Objective: To investigate whether increased physical activity is causally associated with decreased risk of breast and endometrial cancers, using a two-sample Mendelian randomization study design. Design, Setting, and Participants: Genome-wide association studies of physical activity, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer, published up to April 31, 2019, were identified using PubMed and the GWAS catalog. Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) known at P<5x10-8 to be associated with accelerometer-assessed or self-reported physical activity served as instrumental variables. Genetic summary data from four large consortia provided SNP-outcome associations [Breast Cancer Association Consortium; Discovery, Biology and Risk of Inherited Variants in Breast Cancer Consortium; Endometrial Cancer Association Consortium]. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were risk of breast cancer and risk of endometrial cancer. Secondary outcomes were estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and ER- breast cancers. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per mean acceleration in milli-gravities of accelerometer-assessed physical activity and per one standard deviation (1-SD) increase in metabolic-equivalent (MET)-minutes/week of self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were computed using the inverse variance weighted method. A series of sensitivity analyses addressed the potential impact of heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and outliers. Results: Summary data were available for 122,977 breast cancers and 12,270 endometrial cancers. Genetic predisposition to increased accelerometer-assessed physical activity was associated with lower risk of breast and endometrial cancers. The associations (ORs [95% CI] per 1-SD increase in mean acceleration) were 0.88 (0.85-0.91) for breast cancer and 0.90 (0.83-0.97) for endometrial cancer. In addition, genetic predisposition to increased accelerometer-assessed physical activity was associated with lower risk of ER+ breast cancer. We found no evidence for an association between genetic predisposition to self-reported physical activity and risk of total breast cancer, breast cancer subtypes, or endometrial cancer. Conclusion and Relevance: This first Mendelian randomization study shows that objectively-assessed physical activity plays a causal role in protecting against breast and endometrial cancers.","/content/10.1101/19005892v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005892v1.full.pdf","2019-09-18","Epidemiology

"Bi-directional effects between loneliness and substance use: Evidence from a Mendelian randomisation study","Aims: Loneliness and social isolation are associated with cigarette smoking and problematic alcohol use. Observational evidence suggests these associations arise because loneliness increases substance use, however there is potential for reverse causation (problematic drinking causing damage to social networks, leading to loneliness). With conventional epidemiological methods, controlling for (residual) confounding and reverse causality is difficult. In this study, we apply Mendelian randomisation (MR) to assess bi-directional causal effects between loneliness on the one hand and smoking behaviour and alcohol (ab)use on the other. 
Design: We applied bi-directional MR using summary-level data of the largest available genome-wide association studies of loneliness (n=511,280), smoking (initiation (n=249,171), cigarettes-per-day (n=249,171) and cessation (n=143,852)), alcoholic drinks-per-week (n=226,223) and alcohol dependence (n=46,568), using independent samples. For each relationship, we selected genetic variants predictive of the exposure variable as instruments and tested their association with the outcome variable. Effect estimates for individual variants were combined with inverse-variance weighted regression (gene-outcome/gene-exposure association) and the robustness of these findings was assessed with five different sensitivity methods. 
Findings: There was weak evidence of increased loneliness leading to higher likelihood of initiating smoking and smoking more cigarettes, and a lower likelihood of quitting smoking. Additionally, there was evidence that initiating smoking increases loneliness. We found no evidence of a causal effect between loneliness and alcohol (ab)use. 
Conclusions: We report tentative evidence for causal, bidirectional, increasing effects between loneliness and cigarette smoking. These findings improve our understanding of the interrelatedness of smoking and loneliness, however, replication with better powered genetic instruments is recommended.","/content/10.1101/19006767v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006767v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Epidemiology

"Plasminogenuria is associated with podocyte injury, edema, and kidney dysfunction in incident glomerular disease","Urinary plasminogen/plasmin, or plasmin(ogen)uria, has been demonstrated in proteinuric patients and exposure of cultured podocytes to plasminogen results in injury via oxidative stress pathways. A causative role for plasmin(ogen) as a â€œsecond hitâ€ in kidney disease progression has yet to be demonstrated in vivo, and the association between plasmin(ogen)uria and kidney function in glomerular diseases remains unclear. We performed comparative studies in a puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephropathy rat model treated with amiloride, an inhibitor of plasminogen activation, and measured changes in plasmin(ogen)uria and urinary endothelin-1 (ET1). In a glomerular disease biorepository cohort (n=128), we measured time-of- biopsy albuminuria, proteinuria, and plasmin(ogen)uria for correlations with renal outcomes. Increased glomerular plasmin(ogen) was found in PAN rats and FSGS patients. PAN nephropathy was associated with increases in plasmin(ogen)uria, proteinuria, and urinary ET1. Amiloride was protective against PAN- induced glomerular injury, reducing urinary ET1 and oxidative stress. In patients, we found associations between plasmin(ogen)uria and edema status as well as eGFR. Our study demonstrates a role for plasmin(ogen)-induced podocyte injury in the PAN nephropathy model, with amiloride having podocyte- protective properties. In one of largest glomerular disease cohorts to study plasminogen, we validated previous findings while suggesting a potentially novel relationship between plasmin(ogen)uria and eGFR. Together, these findings suggest a role for plasmin(ogen) in mediating glomerular injury and as a viable targetable biomarker for podocyte-sparing treatments.","/content/10.1101/19006809v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006809v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Nephrology

"Does Pecs II Block Reduce the Incidence of Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome (PMPS)? A Cross Sectional Study","Background and Objectives: Post mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is a chronic pain condition that develops after breast cancer surgery. The objective of this study was to determine if Pecs II block administered prior to general anesthesia (GA) reduced the incidence of PMPS after mastectomy and axillary clearance (MAC) when compared with conventional analgesic therapy.

Methods: This cross sectional study compared incidence and severity of PMPS in 288 women who underwent unilateral MAC. Questionnaire survey was done via personal and telephone interview with 145 patients who received conventional analgesic therapy versus 143 patients who received Pecs II block. Outcomes assessed included incidence, severity and chronic pain symptom and sign score of PMPS.

Results: We found a significantly lower incidence of PMPS in patients who received Pecs II block compared with conventional analgesic therapy [49.7% vs. 63.4%, OR 0.57 (0.36-0.91), P = 0.018], which was a 22% relative risk reduction (RR 0.78). Severity of PMPS in Pecs II group was also significantly reduced as shown by lower static and dynamic pain scores at operative site (P < 0.001). Furthermore, Pecs II group reported significantly lower Chronic Pain Symptom and Sign Score (P = 0.002) compared to conventional group.

Conclusions: Pecs II block prior to MAC significantly reduced the incidence of PMPS, severity of chronic pain at operative site and number of chronic pain symptoms and signs related to PMPS.","/content/10.1101/19006924v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006924v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Pain Medicine

"Noise-Assisted MEMD-Based Phase-Connectivity Analysis to Personalize Closed-Loop DBS Therapy in Epilepsy Patients","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment that has been explored for controlling seizures in patients with intractable epilepsy. Many clinical and pre-clinical studies using DBS therapy determine stimulation parameters through trial and error. The same stimulation parameters are often applied to the whole cohort, which consequently produces mixed results of responders and non-responders. In this paper, an adaptive non-linear analytical methodology is proposed to extract stimulation frequency and location(s) from endogenous brain dynamics of epilepsy patients, using phase-synchrony and phase-connectivity analysis, as seizures evolve. The proposed analytical method was applied to seizures recorded using depth electrodes implanted in hippocampus and amygdala in three patients. A reduction in phase-synchrony was observed in all patients around seizure onset. However, phase-synchrony started to gradually increase from mid-ictal and achieved its maximum level at seizure termination. This result suggests that hyper-synchronization of the epileptic network may be a crucial mechanism by which the brain naturally terminates seizure. Stimulation frequency and locations that matched the network phase-synchrony at seizure termination were extracted using phase-connectivity analysis. One patient with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) had a stimulation frequency ~15 Hz with the stimulation locations confined to the hippocampus. The other two patients with extra-temporal lobe epilepsy (ETE) had stimulation frequency ~90 Hz with at least one stimulation location outside of hippocampus. These results suggest that DBS parameters should vary based on the patient's underlying pathology. The proposed methodology provides an algorithm for tuning DBS parameters for individual patients in an effort to increase the clinical efficacy of the therapy.","/content/10.1101/19006908v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006908v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Neurology

"Secrets of the hospital underbelly: abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes in hospital wastewater reflects hospital antimicrobial use and inpatient length of stay","Introduction
Hospital wastewater is a potential major source of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This study uses metagenomics to ask how abundances of AMR genes in hospital wastewater are related to clinical activity. 
Methods
Sewage was collected over a 24-hour period from multiple wastewater collection points representing different specialties within a tertiary hospital site and simultaneously from community sewage works. High throughput shotgun sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq4000. AMR gene abundances were correlated to hospital antimicrobial usage (AMU), data on clinical activity and resistance prevalence in clinical isolates.
Findings
Microbiota and AMR gene composition varied between each collection point and overall AMR gene abundance was higher in hospital wastewater than in community influent. The composition of AMR genes correlated with microbiota composition (Procrustes analysis, p=0.002). Increased antimicrobial consumption at a class level was associated with higher AMR gene abundance within that class in wastewater (incidence rate ratio 2.80, C.I. 1.2-6.5, p=0.016). Prolonged average patient length of stay was associated with higher total AMR gene abundance in wastewater (incidence rate ratio 2.05, C.I. 1.39-3.01, p=0.0003). AMR gene abundance at a class level within hospital wastewater did not reflect resistance patterns in the 181 clinical isolates grown from hospital inpatients over the time of wastewater sampling.
Conclusions
Hospital antimicrobial consumption and patient length of stay are important drivers of AMR gene outflow into the environment. Using metagenomics to identify the full range of AMR genes in hospital wastewater could represent a useful surveillance tool to monitor hospital AMR gene outflow and guide environmental policy on AMR.","/content/10.1101/19006858v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006858v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Correlates of better linear growth among children in sub-Saharan Africa: Cross sectional survey analysis of positive deviants in poor households","Objectives:  To examine the sociodemographic correlates associated with better linear growth among children under 5 years living in poor households 
Design: Cross-sectional
Setting: Ghana, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Mozambique
Participants: Singleton children aged 0 to 59 months, born to mothers aged 15 to 49 years. Information on children was obtained through face-to-face interviews with mothers.
Primary outcome measure:  Child height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ), categorised into HAZ=-2 standard deviations (SD) (better growth/not stunted) and HAZ=-2 SD (stunted/poor growth). 
Results: A unit change in maternal years of education was associated with increased odds of better growth among children living in poor households in DRC [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)= 1.03, 95% CI=1.01,1.07)], Ghana (aOR=1.06, 95% CI=1.01,1.11), Kenya (aOR=1.03, 95% CI= 1.01, 1.05) and Nigeria (aOR=1.08, 95%=1.06,1.10). Maternal antenatal attendance of at least four visits was associated positively with better child growth in DRC (aOR=1.32, 95% CI=1.05, 1.67) and Ghana (aOR=1.67, 95% CI=1.19, 2.33). The association did not reach statistical significance in the remaining three countries. In Ghana, Mozambique and DRC, breastfeeding was associated significantly with the likelihood of better linear growth when only socio-demographic correlates were included in the models, but disappeared after the inclusion of child level covariates. In Nigeria, maternal normal weight was associated with increased odds (aOR=1.24, 95% CI=1.08, 1.43) of better growth among children living in poor households, so was overweight (aOR=1.51, 95% CI= 1.24, 1.83). In all the countries except Ghana, child biological factors such as sex and age were associated with reduced odds of better linear growth.
Conclusions: The socio-demographic factors included in this analysis have the potential to promote linear growth of children under 5 years living in poor households. Interventions aimed at promoting linear growth among children living in poverty should target at enhancing these factors.

"Understanding pretreatment loss to follow-up of tuberculosis patients: an explanatory qualitative study in Chennai, India","Introduction: Pretreatment loss to follow-up (PTLFU)--dropout of patients after diagnosis but before registration in treatment--is a major gap in TB care delivery in India and globally. Patient and healthcare worker (HCW) perspectives are critical for developing interventions to address this problem.

Methods: We prospectively tracked newly diagnosed smear-positive TB patients from 22 TB diagnostic centers in Chennai, one of the largest cities in India. Patients who did not start therapy within 14 days, or who died or were lost to follow-up before official registration in treatment, were classified as PTLFU cases. We conducted qualitative interviews with all trackable PTLFU patients, or family members of patients who had died. We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with three types of HCWs involved in TB care. Interview and FGD recordings were transcribed, coded, and analyzed with the support of Dedoose 8.0.35 software to identify key themes. We created categories into which these themes clustered, identified relationships among thematic categories, and assembled findings into a broader explanatory model for PTLFU. 

Results: We conducted six FGDs comprising 53 HCWs and 33 individual patient or family member interviews. Themes clustered into five categories. Examining relationships among these categories revealed two pathways leading to PTLFU as part of a broader explanatory model. In the first pathway, administrative and organizational health system barriers--including the complexity of navigating the system, healthcare worker absenteeism, and infrastructure failures--resulted in patients feeling frustration or resignation, leading to disengagement from care. Health system barriers experienced by patients were in turn shaped by constraints that made it difficult for HCWs to do their jobs effectively. In the second pathway, negative or judgmental HCW attitudes and behaviors towards patients contributed to patient distrust of the health system, resulting in refusal of further care.

Conclusion: Health system barriers contribute substantially to PTLFU directly and by amplifying patient-related challenges to engaging in care. Interventions should focus on removing administrative hurdles patients face in the health system, improving the quality of the HCW-patient interaction, and alleviating constraints HCWs face in being able to provide optimal patient-centered care.","/content/10.1101/19006312v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006312v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Healthy ageing men have normal reproductive function but display germline-specific molecular changes","Children of older fathers have higher risk for certain diseases. Nevertheless, how ageing specifically affects male germ cells is so far not completely understood. In a cohort of 197 healthy men (18-84 years), we found that semen and reproductive parameters remained normal over six decades. Along with an age-dependent increase in telomere length in sperm (r=0.41, p>0.001), we found accelerated DNA fragmentation, more prominent after the sixth decate of life, and with around 60% of men older than 66 showing abnormal levels of DNA breaks. At the epigenetic level, by whole genome bisulfite sequencing we identified 236 sperm-specific differentially methylated regions between the youngest and oldest group, affecting mostly regions associated with homeobox genes and nervous system development. Therefore, we propose that during ageing, male germ cells are affected by an intrinsic and specific ageing process, distinguishable from the soma. These age-dependent changes might have consequences for fertility and offspring of older men.","/content/10.1101/19006221v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006221v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Sexual and Reproductive Health

"Evaluation of the causal effects of blood lipid levels on gout with summary level GWAS data: two-sample Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis","Objective: Many observational studies have identified that gout patients are often comorbid with dyslipidemia, which is typically characterized by a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and an increase in triglycerides (TG). However, the relationship between dyslipidemia and gout is still unclear.
Methods: We first performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the causal effect of four lipid traits on gout and serum urate based on summary association statistics available from large scale genome-wide association studies (up to ~100,000 for lipid, 69,374 for gout and 110,347 for serum urate). We adopted multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the causal effect independently. We also assessed the mediated effect by serum urate between lipids and gout with a mediation analysis. The MR results were validated with extensive sensitive analyses.
Results: Genetically lower HDL was positively associated with the risk of gout and serum urate concentration. Each standard deviation (SD) (~12.26 mg/dL) increase was genetically associated with an odds ratio of gout of 0.75 (95% CI 0.62 ~ 0.91, p = 3.31E-3) and with a 0.09 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.12 ~ -0.05, p = 7.00E-04) decrease in serum urate concentration. Genetically higher TG was positively associated with the serum urate concentration. Each SD (~112.33 mg/dL) increase was genetically associated with a 0.10 mg/dL (95% CI: 0.06 ~ 0.14, p = 9.87E-05) increase in serum urate concentration. Those results were robust against various sensitive analyses. In addition, the multivariable Mendelian randomization confirmed the independent effect of HDL and TG on the gout/serum urate after adjustment for the other lipids. Finally, the mediation analysis showed that both HDL and TG could indirectly affect gout morbidity via the pathway of serum urate. The mediation effect accounted for about 13.0% or 28.0% of the total effect of HDL and TG, respectively.
Conclusion: Our study confirmed the causal associations between HDL/TG and gout/ serum urate. Furthermore, the effect of HDL or TG on gout could also be mediated by serum urate.

Design: Repeated cross-sectional analysis that applied data-driven temporal variability methods to assess month-by-month changes in routinely-collected medical data. A measure of difference between months was calculated based on joint distributions of age, gender, socio-economic status and recorded cardiovascular diseases. Distances between months were used to identify temporal trends in data recording. Setting: 400 English primary care practices from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD GOLD) and 451 hospital trusts from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Main outcomes: The proportion of patients (CPRD GOLD) and hospital admissions (HES) with a recorded cardiovascular disease (CPRD GOLD: coronary heart disease, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, stroke; HES: International Classification of Disease ICD codes I20-I69/G45). Results: Both databases showed gradual changes in cardiovascular disease recording between 2001 and 2008. The recorded prevalence of included cardiovascular diseases in CPRD GOLD increased by 47%-62%, which partially reversed after 2008. For hospital records in HES, there was a relative decrease in angina pectoris (-34.4%) and unspecified stroke (-42.3%) over the same time period, with a concomitant increase in chronic coronary heart disease (+14.3%). Multiple abrupt changes in the use of myocardial infarction codes in hospital were found in March/April 2010, 2012 and 2014, possibly linked to updates of clinical coding guidelines. Conclusions: Identified temporal variability could be related to potentially non-medical causes such as updated coding guidelines. These artificial changes may introduce temporal correlation among diagnoses inferred from routine data, violating the assumptions of frequently used statistical methods. Temporal variability measures provided an objective and robust technique to identify, and subsequently account for, those changes in electronic health records studies without any prior knowledge of the data collection process.","/content/10.1101/19006098v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006098v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Health Systems and Quality Improvement

"Calibration of individual-based models to epidemiological data: a systematic review","Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of the calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread.
 
We identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based methods to calibrate IBMs in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology that were published between 2013 and 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. We also recorded the reporting of model validation.
  
The PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the criteria for review. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative measure of GOF with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy, which was an optimisation algorithm (14 articles) or a sampling algorithm (26 articles). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32 articles) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12 articles). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25 articles) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Thirty-two (38%) articles reported on model validation.
 
Less than half of the articles reviewed used algorithmic parameter-search strategies. Only one-third of articles quantified the uncertainty around calibrated parameter values and could incorporate this uncertainty into their model projections. There was no consensus on which algorithmic calibration method to use. Only 38% of the articles performed model validation. The adoption of better-documented algorithmic calibration and validation methods could improve both the reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology.","/content/10.1101/19006056v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006056v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Epidemiology

"Burden of Multiple Sclerosis in Eastern Mediterranean Region (1990-2016): Findings From the 2016 Global Burden of Disease Study","Background:  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is among the leading causes of disability in Young Adults worldwide. Current estimates of MS burden in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) are necessary for planning effective interventions. To estimate Prevalence, incidence, mortality, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in EMR by country age, and sex from 1990 to 2016. 
Methods: We estimated regional and country-specific prevalence, incidence, mortality, DALYs, YLLs, and YLDs for MS. DALYs were computed as the sum of YLDs and YLLs.
Results: Total DALYs in EMR countries was 12,810 in 1990 for males and increased to 36,391 in 2016 and from 18,962 to 53,851 for females. Lowest DALYs in both sexes were observed in Somalia (248) while the highest were in Iran (26,394). YLDs in males increased from 6,511 in 1990 to 19,515 in 2016, and in females from 12,247 to 33,937. The highest age-standardized prevalence, incidence, YLDs and DALYs were in Iran (72.11, 2.49, 18.03, and 32.5, respectively). 
Conclusions: Our findings provide valuable information to guide the development and implementation of measures to address the rising burden of MS and it consequences in the EMR countries.","/content/10.1101/19005918v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005918v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Public and Global Health

"Checklists to Detect Potential Predatory Biomedical Journals: A Systematic Review","Background: We believe there is a large number of checklists to help authors detect predatory journals. It is uncertain whether these checklists contain similar content.

Purpose: Perform a systematic review to identify checklists to detect potential predatory journals and to examine their content and measurement properties. 

Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, Web of Science and Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts (January 2012 to November 2018), university library websites (January 2019), YouTube (January 2019).

Study Selection: Original checklists used to detect potential predatory journals published in English, French or Portuguese, with instructions in point form, bullet form, tabular format or listed items, not including lists or guidance on recognizing ""legitimate"" or ""trustworthy"" journals.

Data Extraction: Pairs of reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed checklist quality and a third reviewer resolved conflicts. 

Data Synthesis: Of 1528 records screened, 93 met our inclusion criteria. The majority of included checklists were in English (n = 90, 97%), could be completed in fewer than five minutes (n = 68, 73%), had an average of 11 items, which were not weighted (n = 91, 98%), did not include qualitative guidance (n = 78, 84%) or quantitative guidance (n = 91, 98%), were not evidence-based (n = 90, 97%) and covered a mean of four (of six) thematic categories. Only three met our criteria for being evidence-based.
 
Limitations: Limited languages and years of publication, searching other media. 

Conclusions: There is a plethora of published checklists that may overwhelm authors looking to efficiently guard against publishing in predatory journals. The similarity in checklists could lead to the creation of evidence-based tools serving authors from all disciplines.","/content/10.1101/19005728v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005728v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Medical Education

"Dose-dependent degeneration of non-cancerous brain tissue in post-radiotherapy patients: A diffusion tensor imaging study","Background and purpose: Radiation-induced changes in brain tissue may relate to post-radiotherapy (RT) cognitive decline. Our aim is to investigate changes of the brain microstructural properties after exposure to radiation during clinical protocols of RT using diffusion MRI (dMRI).
Methods and Materials: The susceptibility of tissue changes to radiation was investigated in a clinically heterogenic cohort (age, pathology, tumor location, type of surgery) consisting of 121 scans of 18 patients (10 females). The imaging dataset included 18 planning CTs and 103 dMRI scans (range 2-14, median = 6 per patient) assessing pre-operative, post-operative pre-RT and post-RT states. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics were estimated from all scans for a region-of-interest based linear relation analysis between mean dose and change in DTI metrics, while partial volume effects were regressed out.
Results: The largest regional dose dependency with mean diffusivity appear in the white matter of the frontal pole in the left hemisphere by an increase of 2.61 %/(Gy x year). Full brain-wise, pooled results for white matter show fractional anisotropy to decrease by 0.85 %/(30Gy x year); mean diffusivity increase by 9.17 %/(30Gy x year); axial diffusivity increase by 7.30%/(30Gy x year) and radial diffusivity increases by 10.63%/(30Gy x year).
Conclusions: White matter is susceptible to radiation with some regional variability where diffusivity metrics demonstrate the largest relative sensitivity. This suggests that dMRI is a promising tool in assessing microstructural changes after RT, which can help in understanding treatment-induced cognitive decline.","/content/10.1101/19005157v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005157v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Oncology

"Reactions to an Online Demonstration of the Effect of Increased Fruit and Vegetable Consumption on Appearance: Survey","Background. Inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption causes a considerable disease burden and premature mortality. Despite considerable public health promotion of a healthy diet the average consumption is still below recommended levels. Fruit and vegetable consumption influences human skin colour, increasing red/yellow/orange pigment in the skin. Given that this colour is deemed attractive and healthy looking, the appearance benefit may provide motivation to eat more fruit and vegetables. Such appearance motivation could be particularly effective in young individuals who currently eat least fruit and vegetables. 

Objectives. To assess how widely the impact of diet on skin colour is known within the UK. To compare the strength of motivation to eat fruit and vegetables based on health and appearance benefits and to compare the effect of different UK demographics on motivation. 

Methods. Four groups of UK residents (N = 200 each group) were recruited through the Prolific online platform. Groups comprised younger (aged 18 to 24) and older adults (aged 40 to 60) of low and high self-reported socioeconomic status (1 to 5 and 6 to 10 on a 10 point rating scale). Facial images simulating the skin colour associated with low and high fruit and vegetable diets were shown to participants. Questionnaires were used to assess (1) background knowledge of the health and skin colour effects of dietary fruit and vegetables; (2) the specific motivational impact of the skin colour illustration and (3) the relative importance of motivation to consume fruit and vegetables arising from health and skin colour appearance benefits.

Results. (1) 61% of all participants were unaware of the dietary skin colour association.
(2) 57% of participants found the simple demonstration of the dietary impact on skin colour positively motivating to eat more fruit and vegetables. The visual demonstration was equally motivating for participants of high and low self-reported socioeconomic status (P = .63) and different ethnic backgrounds (White N = 453, Black N = 182, Asian N = 87, P = .22). Health benefits from a diet high in fruit and vegetables were regarded as more motivating than skin colour appearance benefits. The appearance benefits of a high fruit and vegetable diet (compared to the health benefits) were relatively more important for the younger participants (Mann-Whitney U = 96,263, P < .001) and for women (N = 489) than for men (N = 310, U = 83,763, P = .01). 

Conclusions. These findings indicate that promotion of the skin colour effects of diets high in fruit and vegetables could provide additional motivation for a healthier diet. Our study indicates the wide appeal of appearance benefits from dietary fruit and vegetable (across ethnicity and socioeconomic status) and particularly amongst young adults where inadequate diet is most prevalent.","/content/10.1101/19004523v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004523v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Public and Global Health

"CX3CR1 as a Respiratory Syncytial Virus Receptor in Pediatric Human Lung","Objectives: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause of severe respiratory illness in young children. Data on the host factors that contribute to infection of young children by RSV are limited. The human chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, has recently been implicated as an RSV receptor in adult epithelial cells in vitro. Here we evaluate a role for CX3CR1 in pediatric lung RSV infections. 
Study Design: CX3CR1 transcript levels were assessed in pediatric airways using existing RNAseq data characterizing gene expression in the upper and lower airways. Tissue localization and cell specific expression of CX3CR1 in pediatric lung tissue was confirmed using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The role of CX3CR1 in RSV infection was also investigated in vitro using a novel, physiological model of pediatric epithelial cells.   
Results: Low levels of CX3CR1 transcript were often, but not always, expressed in both the upper (62%) and lower airways (36%) of pediatric subjects between 1 month and 8 years of age. CX3CR1 transcript and protein expression was detected in epithelial cells of intact, normal human pediatric lung tissues. In vitro, CX3CR1 expression was readily detected on primary cultures of differentiated pediatric/infant human lung epithelial cells. RSV demonstrated preferential infection of CX3CR1 positive cells, and blocking CX3CR1/RSV interaction significantly decreased productive viral infection in vitro.  
Conclusions: CX3CR1 is present in the airways of pediatric subjects where it may serve as a receptor for RSV infection. Furthermore, CX3CR1 appears to play a mechanistic role in mediating viral infection of pediatric airway epithelial cells in vitro.","/content/10.1101/19002394v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002394v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Pediatrics

"Deep-learning-based Prediction of Late Age-Related Macular Degeneration Progression","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Previous genetic and epidemiological studies have shown that the AMD progression are affected by genetic variants and environmental factors. AMD severity is mainly diagnosed by color fundus images and recent studies have shown the success of machine learning methods in predicting AMD progression using image data. However, none of the studies have utilized both genetics and image data for predicting AMD progression. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a large-scale clinical trial from the National Eye Institute, includes massive genome-wide genotyping data, longitudinal color fundus photographs, and disease severity assessment over a period of 12 years, providing an unprecedented opportunity to investigate prediction models for AMD progression. In this report, we jointly used genotypes and fundus images to dynamically predict an eye as having progressed to late AMD (e.g., whether the time to progression to late AMD for the eye exceeds 3 years from the current visit) with a modified deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In total, we used 31,262 color fundus images centered on the macula from 1,351 subjects with corresponding genotypes and phenotypes available at baseline and follow-up visits. The first part of this model was derived from a CNN to extract features. Our results showed that the color fundus photos coupled with genotypes could predict late AMD progression with an averaged area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.83-0.86). The results using fundus images alone showed an AUC of 0.81 (95%CI: 0.80-0.83). We have validated our results in an independent dataset of 200 Caucasians extracted from UK Biobank and the results showed an AUC of 0.9 (95%CI: 0.85-0.94) for predicting whether the eye progresses to late AMD exceeding the 3 years. We implemented our model in a cloud-based application for individual risk assessment.","/content/10.1101/19006171v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006171v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Ophthalmology

"GWAS-based Machine Learning for Prediction of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Risk","Numerous independent susceptibility variants have been identified for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Since advanced AMD is currently incurable, an accurate prediction of a person's AMD risk using genetic information is desirable for early diagnosis and clinical management. In this study, genotype data of 32,215 Caucasian individuals with age above 50 years from the International AMD Genomics Consortium in dbGAP were used to establish and validate prediction models for AMD risk using four different machine learning approaches: neural network, lasso regression, support vector machine, and random forest. A standard logistic regression model was also considered using a genetic risk score. To identify feature SNPs for AMD prediction models, we selected the genome-wide significant SNPs from GWAS. All methods achieved good performance for predicting normal controls versus advanced AMD cases (AUC=0.81~0.82 in a separate test dataset) and normal controls versus any AMD (AUC=0.78~0.79).  By applying the state-of-art machine learning approaches on the large AMD GWAS data, the predictive models we established can provide an accurate estimation of an individual's AMD risk profile across the person's lifespan based on a comprehensive genetic information.","/content/10.1101/19006155v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006155v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Ophthalmology

"How do maternal HIV infection and the early nutritional environment influence the development of infants exposed to HIV in utero?","Malnutrition and infectious disease often coexist in socially inequitable contexts. Malnutrition in the perinatal period adversely affects offspring development and lifelong non-communicable disease risk. Less is known about the effects of infectious disease exposure during critical windows of development and health, and links between in utero HIV-exposure in the absence of neonatal infection, perinatal nutritional environments, and infant development are poorly defined. In a pilot feasibility study at Kalafong Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa, we aimed to better understand relationships between maternal HIV infection and the early nutritional environment of in utero HIV exposed uninfected (HEU) infants. We also undertook exploratory analyses to investigate relationships between food insecurity and infant development. Mother-infant dyads were recruited after delivery and followed until 12 weeks postpartum. Household food insecurity, nutrient intakes and dietary diversity scores did not differ between mothers living with or without HIV. Maternal reports of food insecurity were associated with lower maternal nutrient intakes 12 weeks postpartum, and in infants, higher brain-to-body weight ratio at birth and 12 weeks of age, and attainment of fewer large movement and play activities milestones at 12 weeks of age, irrespective of maternal HIV status. Reports of worry about food runout were associated with increased risk of stunting for HEU, but not unexposed, uninfected infants. Our findings suggest that food insecurity, in a vulnerable population, adversely affects maternal nutritional status and infant development. In utero exposure to HIV may further perpetuate these effects, which has implications for early child development and lifelong human capital.","/content/10.1101/19003871v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003871v2.full.pdf","2019-09-14","HIV/AIDS

"Influenza-associated mortality for different causes of death during the 2010-2011 through the 2014-2015 influenza seasons in Russia","Background: There is limited information on the volume of influenza-associated mortality in Russia.

Methods: Using previously developed methodology (Goldstein et al., Epidemiology 2012), we regressed the monthly rates of mortality for respiratory causes, circulatory causes, and for certain infectious and parasitic diseases (available from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat)) linearly against the monthly proxies for the incidence of influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B (obtained using data from the Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza (RII) on levels of ILI/ARI consultations and the percent of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B), adjusting for the baseline rates of mortality not associated with influenza circulation and temporal trends.

Results: For the 2010/11 through the 2014/15 seasons, influenza circulation was associated with an average annual 11106 (95% CI (4321,17892)) deaths for circulatory causes, 4552 (3744,5360) deaths for respiratory causes, and 343 (63,624) deaths for certain infectious and parasitic diseases, with influenza A/H3N2 being responsible for the majority of influenza-associated respiratory deaths and influenza B making a substantial contribution to influenza-associated mortality for circulatory causes.

Conclusions: Influenza circulation is associated with a substantial mortality burden in Russia, particularly for circulatory deaths. Those results support the potential utility of influenza vaccination (with the role played by influenza B in circulatory mortality pointing to the benefit of quadrivalent influenza vaccines), as well as of administration of antiviral drugs for high-risk individuals during periods of active influenza circulation.","/content/10.1101/19005470v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005470v2.full.pdf","2019-09-14","Epidemiology

"The Mezurio smartphone application: Evaluating the feasibility of frequent digital cognitive assessment in the PREVENT dementia study","Background: Smartphones may significantly contribute to the detection of early cognitive decline at scale by enabling remote, frequent, sensitive, economic assessment. Several prior studies have sustained engagement with participants remotely over a period of a week; extending this to a period of a month would clearly give greater opportunity for measurement. However, as such study durations are increased, so too is the need to understand how participant burden and scientific value might be optimally balanced.
Objectives: We explore the 'little but often' approach to assessment employed by the Mezurio app, interacting with participants every day for over a month. We aim to understand whether this extended remote study duration is feasible, and which factors might promote sustained participant engagement over such study durations. 
Methods: Thirty-five adults (aged 40-59 years) with no diagnosis of cognitive impairment were prompted to interact with the Mezurio smartphone app platform for up to 36 days, completing short, daily episodic memory tasks in addition to optional executive function and language tests. A subset (n=20) completed semi-structured interviews focused on their experience using the app. 
Results: Average compliance with the schedule of learning for subsequent memory test was 80%, with 88% of participants still actively engaged by the final task. Thematic analysis of participants' experiences highlighted schedule flexibility, a clear user-interface, and performance feedback as important considerations for engagement with remote digital assessment.
Conclusions: Despite the extended study duration, participants demonstrated high compliance with the tasks scheduled and were extremely positive about their experiences. Long durations of remote digital interaction are therefore definitely feasible, but only when careful attention is paid to the design of the user experience.","/content/10.1101/19005124v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005124v2.full.pdf","2019-09-14","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"The Implementation, Diagnostic Yield and Clinical Outcome of Genetic Testing on an Inpatient Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Service","Objective: Diagnostic genetic testing is recommended for children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).  However, many children with NDDs do not receive genetic testing.  One approach to improve access to genetic services for these patients is to offer testing on the inpatient child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) service. 
Methods: We implemented systematic genetic testing on an inpatient CAP service by providing medical genetics education to CAP fellows. We compared the genetic testing rates pre- and post-education. We compared the diagnostic yield to previously published studies and the demographics of our cohort to inpatients who received genetic testing on other clinical services. We assessed rates of outpatient genetics follow-up post-discharge.
Results: The genetic testing rate on the inpatient CAP service was 1.6% (2/125) before the educational intervention and 10.7% (21/197) afterwards (OR = 7.26, 95% CI = 1.72-65.12, p = 0.0015). Diagnostic yield for patients on the inpatient service was 4.3% (1/23), lower than previously reported. However, 34.8% (8/23) of patients had variants of unknown significance (VUSs). 39.1% (9/23) of children who received genetic testing while inpatients were underrepresented minorities, compared to 7.7% (1/13) of patients who received genetic testing on other clinical services (OR = 7.35, CI = 0.81-365.00, p = 0.057).  43.5% of patients were lost to outpatient genetics follow-up. 
Conclusion: Medical genetics education for fellows on an inpatient CAP service can improve genetic testing rates. Genetic testing for inpatients may primarily identify VUSs instead of well-known NDD risk variants. Genetic testing on the inpatient CAP service may improve access to genetic services for underrepresented minorities, but assuring outpatient follow-up can be challenging.","/content/10.1101/19004846v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004846v2.full.pdf","2019-09-14","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Transmission Dynamics of and Insights from the 2018-2019 Measles Outbreak in New York City: A Modeling Study","In 2018-2019, New York City experienced the largest measles outbreak in the US in nearly three decades. To identify key factors contributing to this outbreak to aid future public health interventions, here we developed a model-inference system to infer the transmission dynamics of measles in the affected community, based on incidence data. Our results indicate that delayed vaccination of young children aged 1-4 years enabled the initial spread of measles and that increased infectious contact among this age group, likely via gatherings intended to expose unvaccinated children (i.e. ""measles parties""), further aggravated the outbreak and led to widespread of measles beyond this age group. We found that around half of infants were susceptible to measles by age 1 (the age-limit to receive the first vaccine dose in the US); as such, infants experienced a large number of infections during the outbreak. We showed that without the implemented vaccination campaigns, the outbreak severity including numbers of infections and hospitalizations would be 10 times higher and predominantly affect infants and children under 4. These results suggest that recommending the first vaccine dose before age 1 and the second dose before age 4 could allow pro-vaccine parents to vaccinate and protect infants and young children more effectively, should high level of vaccine hesitancy persist.  In addition, enhanced public health education is needed to reduce activities that unnecessarily expose children to measles and other infections.","/content/10.1101/19005298v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005298v2.full.pdf","2019-09-14","Epidemiology

"Explaining the outcomes of the 'Clean India' campaign: institutional behaviour and sanitation transformation in India","Introduction: Whilst many less developed countries are struggling to provide universal access to safe sanitation, in the last five years India has almost reached its target of eliminating open defaecation. The object of this study was to understand how the Indian Government effected this sanitation transformation.
Methods: The study employed interviews with 17 actors in the Governments Clean India programme across the national capital and four states which were analysed using a theory of change grounded in Behaviour Centred Design. 
Results: The Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) claims to have improved the coverage of toilets in rural India from 39% to over 95% of households between 2014 and mid 2019. From interviews with relevant actors we constructed a theory of change for the programme in which high-level political support and disruptive leadership changed environments in districts, which led to psychological changes in district officials, which, in turn, led to changed behaviour concerning sanitation programming. The Prime Ministers setting of the ambitious goal to eliminate open defecation by the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi (October 2019) galvanised government bureaucracy, while early success in 100 flagship districts reduced the scepticism of government employees, a cadre of 500 young professionals placed in districts imparted new ideas and energy, social and mass media was used to engage and motivate the public and key players, and new norms of ethical behaviour were demonstrated by leaders. As a result, district officials engaged emotionally with the programme and felt pride at their achievements in ridding villages of open defecation. 
Conclusions: Though many challenges remain, Governments seeking to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of universal access to safe sanitation can emulate the success of Indias Swachh Bharat Mission.","/content/10.1101/19004689v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004689v2.full.pdf","2019-09-14","Public and Global Health

"Genetic liability to schizophrenia is associated with exposure to traumatic events in childhood","Background: There is a wealth of literature on the observed association between childhood trauma and psychotic illness. However, the relationship between childhood trauma and psychosis is complex and could be explained, in part, by gene-environment correlation.
Methods: The association between schizophrenia polygenic scores (PGS) and experiencing childhood trauma was investigated using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Schizophrenia PGS were derived in each cohort for children, mothers, and fathers where genetic data were available. Measures of trauma exposure were derived based on data collected throughout childhood and adolescence (0-17 years; ALSPAC) and at age 8 years (MoBa).
Results: Within ALSPAC, we found a positive association between schizophrenia PGS and exposure to trauma across childhood and adolescence; effect sizes were consistent for both child or maternal PGS. We found evidence of an association between the schizophrenia PGS and the majority of trauma subtypes investigated, with the exception of bullying. These results were comparable in MoBa. Within ALSPAC, genetic liability to a range of additional psychiatric traits was also associated with a greater trauma exposure.
Conclusions: Results from two international birth cohorts indicate that genetic liability for a range of psychiatric traits is associated with experiencing childhood trauma. GWAS of psychiatric phenotypes may also reflect risk factors for these phenotypes. Our findings also suggest that youth at higher genetic risk might require greater resources/support to ensure they grow-up in a healthy environment.","/content/10.1101/19006577v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006577v1.full.pdf","2019-09-13","Epidemiology

"Gender dependent pharmacotherapy for blocking transition to chronic back pain: a proof of concept randomized trial","Preventing transition to chronic back pain (CBP) is an ideal strategy that would rescue patients from years to a lifetime of suffering with pain. Recent studies suggest involvement of sexually-dimorphic dopaminergic-motivational circuits in the transition to chronic pain (tCBP), and hints the combination of carbidopa/levodopa and naproxen (LDP+NPX) may block tCBP. We tested these concepts in early onset BP, who were stratified by risk for tCBP using brain properties. Those identified as low-risk entered a no-treatment arm. The rest were randomized into a double-blind, placebo and naproxen (PLC+NPX) controlled trial of oral LDP+NPX for 12 weeks, and a post-treatment 12-weeks follow-up. 59 participants completed the study. Both treatments resulted in ~50% pain relief for ~75%, sustained post-treatment. LDP+NPX was highly effective in females (>80% pain relief), it modified BP personality, and was related to objective brain functional changes. Although performed in a small group of early onset BP, multiple subjective and objective measures consistently suggest that these long-duration treatments persistently, and gender-dependently, block tCBP.","/content/10.1101/19006627v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006627v1.full.pdf","2019-09-13","Pain Medicine

"Village-scale persistence and elimination of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis","Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is one of several neglected tropical diseases that is targeted for elimination by the World Health Organization. Recent years have seen a substantial decline in the number of globally reported cases, largely driven by an intensive process of screening and treatment. However, this infection is highly focal, continuing to persist at low prevalence even in small populations. Regional elimination, and ultimately global eradication, rests on understanding the dynamics and persistence of this infection at the local population scale. Here we develop a stochastic model of gHAT dynamics, which is underpinned by screening and reporting data from one of the highest gHAT incidence regions, Kwilu Province, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We use this model to explore the persistence of gHAT in villages of different population sizes and subject to different patterns of screening. Our models demonstrate that infection is expected to persist for long periods even in relatively small isolated populations. We further use the model to assess the risk of recrudescence following local elimination and consider how failing to detect cases during active screening events informs the probability of elimination. These quantitative results provide insights for public health policy in the region, particularly highlighting the difficulties in achieving and measuring the 2030 elimination goal.","/content/10.1101/19006502v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006502v1.full.pdf","2019-09-13","Epidemiology

"Multifocal breast cancers are more prevalent in BRCA2 versus BRCA1 mutation carriers","Multifocal breast cancer is generally considered to be where two or more breast tumours are present within the same breast, but are clearly separated with no intervening in situ or invasive disease. It is seen in ~10% of breast cancer cases. This study investigates multifocality prevalence in BRCA1/2 mutant patients via cross-sectional analysis. Data from 211 women with BRCA1/2 mutations (91 BRCA1), (120 BRCA2), with breast cancer were collected including age, tumour focality, size, type, grade, and receptor profile. The prevalence of multifocality within this group was 25%, but within subgroups, prevalence amongst BRCA2 carriers was more than double that of BRCA1 carriers (p=0.001). Women affected by multifocal tumours had proportionately higher oestrogen receptor positivity (p=0.001), lower triple negativity (p=0.004), and were more likely to be younger at diagnosis compared with those with unifocal tumours (p=0.039). Odds of a BRCA2 carrier developing multifocal cancer were almost four-fold higher than a BRCA1 carrier (OR: 3.71, CI: 1.77 to 7.78, p=0.001). BRCA2 carriers show much greater multifocality than those carrying BRCA1. Multifocal tumours are strongly associated with being both BRCA2 mutant and oestrogen receptor positive.","/content/10.1101/19006478v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006478v1.full.pdf","2019-09-13","Surgery

"Intrinsic capacity as a framework for Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE); insights from the 10/66 Dementia Research Group cohort studies in Latin America, India and China","Background
The World Health Organization has reframed health and healthcare for older people around achieving the goal of healthy ageing. Recent evidence-based guidelines on Integrated Care for Older People focus on maintaining intrinsic capacity, addressing declines in mobility, nutrition, vision and hearing, cognition, mood and continence aiming to prevent or delay the onset of care dependence. The target group (with one or more declines in intrinsic capacity) is broad, and implementation at scale may be challenging in less-resourced settings. Planning can be informed by assessing the prevalence of intrinsic capacity, characterising the target group, and validating the general approach by evaluating risk prediction for incident dependence and mortality.  

Methods
Population-based cohort studies in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico, India and China. Sociodemographic, behaviour and lifestyle, health, healthcare utilisation and cost questionnaires, and physical assessments were administered to all participants, with ascertainment of incident dependence, and mortality, three to five years later.   

Results
In the 12 sites in eight countries, 17,031 participants were surveyed at baseline. Intrinsic capacity was least likely to be retained for locomotion (71.2%), vision (71.3%), cognition (73.5%), and mood (74.1%). Only 30% retained full capacity across all domains, varying between one quarter and two-fifths in most sites. The proportion retaining capacity fell sharply with increasing age, and declines affecting multiple domains were more common. Poverty, morbidity (particularly dementia, depression and stroke), and disability were concentrated among those with DIC, although only 10% were frail, and a further 9% had needs for care. Hypertension and lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease, healthcare utilization and costs were more evenly distributed in the general older population. 15,901 participants were included in the mortality cohort (2,602 deaths/ 53,911 person years of follow-up), and 12,965 participants in the dependence cohort (1900 incident cases/ 38,377 person-years). DIC (any decline, and number of domains affected) strongly and independently predicted incident dependence and death. Relative risks were higher for those who were frail, but were also substantially elevated for the much larger sub-groups yet to become frail. Mortality was mainly concentrated in the frail and dependent sub-groups.
Conclusions
Our findings support the strategy to focus on optimizing intrinsic capacity in pursuit of healthy ageing. Most needs for care arise in those with declines in intrinsic capacity who are yet to become frail. Implementation at scale requires community-based screening and assessment, and a stepped-care approach to intervention. Community healthcare workers roles would need redefinition to engage, train and support them in these tasks. ICOPE could be usefully integrated into community programmes orientated to the detection and case management of chronic diseases including hypertension and diabetes.","/content/10.1101/19006403v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006403v1.full.pdf","2019-09-12","Health Systems and Quality Improvement

"Alcohol use and cognitive functioning in young adults: an observational and Mendelian randomisation study","Background and Aims: There have been few prospective studies of association between alcohol use and cognitive functioning in young people. We aim to examine whether alcohol use is a risk factor for deficient cognitive functioning in young adults. 
Design: Longitudinal latent class analysis was used to derive patterns of binge drinking. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between binge drinking and subsequent cognitive functioning. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) tested evidence for the causal relationship between alcohol use and cognitive functioning. 
Setting: South West England.
Participants: The observational study comprised of 2086 adolescents and their parents (fully adjusted models) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. 
Measurements: Binge drinking was assessed on five occasions from age 16 to 23 years. Cognitive functioning comprised working memory, response inhibition, and emotion recognition assessed at 24 years of age. 99-independent genome-wide significant SNPs associated with number of drinks per week was used as the genetic instrument for alcohol consumption. Potential confounders were included.
Findings: Four binge drinking classes were identified: low-risk (41%), adolescent-limited (19%), adult-regular (23%), and early-onset regular (17%). There was not a consistent association between binge drinking and subsequent cognitive functioning. For example, we found insufficient evidence to support an association between early-onset regular binge drinking and cognitive functioning in the fully adjusted models: working memory (b=0.09, 95% CI=-0.10 to 0.28), response inhibition (b=0.70, 95% CI=-10.55 to 11.95), and emotion recognition (b=0.01, 95% CI=-0.01 to 0.02) compared to low-risk drinkers. Two-sample MR analyses similarly provided little evidence that alcohol use is associated with deficits in working memory (b=0.14, 95% CI=-0.45 to 0.72), response inhibition (b=-0.31, 95% CI=-0.92 to 0.29), and emotion recognition (0.03, 95% CI=-0.55 to 0.61).
Conclusions: Binge drinking in adolescence and early adulthood may not be a strong predictor for deficient cognitive functioning in young adults.","/content/10.1101/19003327v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003327v1.full.pdf","2019-09-12","Epidemiology

"Dyspareunia in their own words: A comprehensive qualitative description of endometriosis-associated sexual pain","Background: Dyspareunia is a classic symptom of endometriosis but is neglected in research and clinical contexts. This study explored the experience of this endometriosis-associated sexual pain.
Methods: This was a qualitative descriptive study that included people who had experienced endometriosis-associated dyspareunia alone or with a partner. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews with a female researcher that began with an open-ended question about dyspareunia and included interview prompts related to the nature of sexual pain. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed for themes. 
Results: 17 participants completed interviews. The mean participant age was 33.3 (SD=7.2) and most participants identified as white (82%), were college-educated (71%), identified as heterosexual (65%), and were partnered (59%). Location, onset, and character emerged as important, interrelated features of endometriosis-associated dyspareunia, as did severity and impact. Dyspareunia occurred at the vaginal opening (n=7) and in the abdomen/pelvis (n=13). Pain at the vaginal opening began with initial penetration and had pulling, burning and stinging qualities. Pain in the pelvis was typically experienced with deep penetration or in certain position and was described as sharp, stabbing and/or cramping. Dyspareunia ranged from mild to severe, and for some participants had a marked psychosocial impact. 
Conclusions: Dyspareunia is a heterogeneous symptom of endometriosis that ranges in severity and impact. Disaggregating dyspareunia into superficial and deep types may better reflect the etiologies of this pain, thereby improving outcome measurement in intervention studies and clinical care.","/content/10.1101/19005793v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005793v1.full.pdf","2019-09-12","Sexual and Reproductive Health

"Absence of Testicular Adrenal Rest Tumors in Newborns, Infants, and Toddlers with Classical Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia","INTRODUCTION: Testicular adrenal rest tumors (TART) are a known consequence for males with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. TART are associated with potential infertility in adults. However, little is known about TART in very young males with CAH.   
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the prevalence of TART in newborn, infant, and toddler males with classical CAH via scrotal ultrasound.
METHODS: Males with CAH had scrotal ultrasounds during the first 4 years of life, evaluating testes for morphology, blood flow, and presence of TART. Newborn screen 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and serum 17-OHP at the time of ultrasound were recorded. Bone ages were considered very advanced if = 2SD above chronological age.  
RESULTS: Thirty-one ultrasounds in 16 males were performed. An initial ultrasound was obtained in four newborns at diagnosis (6.8 Â± 2.1 days), six infants (2.2 Â± 0.9 months), and six toddlers (2.4 Â± 0.9 years). Eleven males had at least one repeat ultrasound. A large proportion (11/16) were in poor hormonal control with an elevated 17-OHP (325 Â± 298 nmol/L). One infant was in very poor hormonal control (17-OHP 447 nmol/L) at initial ultrasound, and two toddlers had advanced bone ages (+3.2 and +4.5 SD) representing exposure to postnatal androgens. However, no TART were detected in any subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: TART were not found in males up to 4 years of age with classical CAH despite settings with expected high ACTH drive. Further research into the occurrence of TART in CAH may elucidate factors which contribute to the detection and individual predisposition to TART.","/content/10.1101/19005975v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005975v1.full.pdf","2019-09-11","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Dissociative experiences in fibromyalgia are mediated by symptoms of autonomic dysfunction","Background: Fibromyalgia is characterised by chronic widespread pain.  Quality of life is further reduced by autonomic and cognitive symptoms, including subjective brain-fog and dissociative experiences. Although an association with joint hypermobility suggests variant connective tissue is a factor in both fibromyalgia and dysautonomia, the mechanisms underlying the neuropsychiatric symptoms are poorly understood. 

Methods: 21 fibromyalgia patients and 21 healthy controls were assessed for joint hypermobility dissociative experiences, autonomic symptoms and interoceptive sensibility. Mediation analyses were conducted according to the method of Baron and Kenny. 

Results: Patients with fibromyalgia reported greater dissociative experiences and autonomic symptoms. The relationship between fibromyalgia and dissociative experiences was fully mediated by symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. Fibromyalgia, dissociative experiences and orthostatic intolerance all were associated with joint hypermobility and interoceptive sensibility. 

Conclusions: This exploratory investigation highlights the relationship between dissociative experiences in the context of fibromyalgia and subjective experience of aberrant physiological responses.  These findings can enhance the recognition and management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia, wherein dissociative experiences reflect disturbance of self-representation that can arise through abnormalities in internal agency, autonomic (dys)control and interoceptive prediction errors.","/content/10.1101/19006320v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006320v1.full.pdf","2019-09-11","Neurology

"Cohort Profile: the Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre Discovery Cohort Magnetic Resonance Imaging sub-study (OPDC-MRI)","Purpose: The Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre (OPDC) Discovery Cohort magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sub-study (OPDC-MRI) collects high quality multimodal brain MRI together with deep longitudinal clinical phenotyping in patients with Parkinson's, at-risk individuals and healthy elderly participants. The primary aim is to detect pathological changes in brain structure and function, and develop, together with the clinical data, biomarkers to stratify, predict and chart progression in early-stage Parkinson's and at-risk individuals.
Participants: Participants are recruited from the OPDC Discovery Cohort, a prospective, longitudinal study. Baseline MRI data is currently available for 290 participants: 119 patients with early idiopathic Parkinson's, 15 Parkinson's patients with pathogenic mutations of the LRRK2 or GBA genes, 68 healthy controls and 87 individuals at risk of Parkinson's (asymptomatic carriers of GBA mutation and patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder - RBD).
Findings to date: Differences in brain structure in early Parkinson's were found to be subtle, with small changes in the shape of the globus pallidus and evidence of alterations in microstructural integrity in the prefrontal cortex that correlated with performance on executive function tests. Brain function, as assayed with resting fMRI yielded more substantial differences, with basal ganglia connectivity reduced in early Parkinson's, and RBD, but not Alzheimer's, suggesting that the effect is pathology specific. Imaging of the substantia nigra with the more recent adoption of sequences sensitive to iron and neuromelanin content shows promising results in identifying early signs of Parkinsonian disease.
Future plans: Ongoing studies include the integration of multimodal MRI measures to improve discrimination power. Follow-up clinical data are now accumulating and will allow us to correlate baseline imaging measures to clinical disease progression. Follow-up MRI scanning started in 2015 and is currently ongoing, providing the opportunity for future longitudinal imaging analyses with parallel clinical phenotyping.","/content/10.1101/19005819v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005819v1.full.pdf","2019-09-11","Neurology

"Sex-related differences in the clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia","Objective: To investigate the sex-related differences in the clinical diagnosis of the frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in the Hospital Sant Pau, Barcelona.
Methods: We selected patients diagnosed of FTD from the SPIN cohort (Hospital Sant Pau) and analyzed clinical data. Participants were classified in three different groups according to the clinical presentation. We compared clinical data between sexes in each group.
Results: A total of 193 patients were included: 41% in the behavioural group, 47% in the motor group and 12% in the language group. We found a higher proportion of men in the behavioural group when compared to the motor and language groups (<U+03C7>-squared=27.042; p<0.001). Within the behavioural group: women presented with a lower MMSE at diagnosis (Mann-Whitney U=262.0; p=0.041) and women received a previous diagnosis of depression more frequently than men (<U+03C7> squared= 7.393; p=0.007). In the motor and language groups no sex-related differences were observed.

"A deep learning approach with event-related spectral EEG data in attentional deficit hyperactivity disorder","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of the pediatric and adult population worldwide. The diagnosis remains essentially clinical, based on history and exam, with no available biomarkers. In this paper, we describe a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for ADHD classification derived from the time-frequency decomposition of electroencephalography data (EEG), particularly of event-related potentials (ERP) during the Flanker Task collected from 20 ADHD adult patients and 20 healthy controls (HC). The model reaches a classification accuracy of 88%, superior to resting state EEG spectrograms and with the key advantage, compared with other machine learning approaches, of avoiding the need for manual selection of EEG spectral or channel features. Finally, through the use of feature visualization techniques, we show that the main features exciting the DCNN nodes are a decreased power in the alpha band and an increased power in the delta-theta band around 100ms for ADHD patients compared to HC, suggestive of attentional and inhibition deficits, which have been previously suggested as pathophyisiological signatures of ADHD. While confirmation with larger clinical samples is necessary, these results highlight the potential of this methodology to develop CNS biomarkers of practical clinical utility.","/content/10.1101/19005611v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005611v1.full.pdf","2019-09-11","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances in a cohort of women firefighters and office workers in San Francisco","Background: Studies in male firefighters have demonstrated increased exposures to carcinogenic compounds and increased rates of certain cancers compared to the general population.  Many chemicals related to these occupational exposures have been associated with breast tumor development in animal and human studies, yet, there have been no studies on women firefighters due to their low numbers in most fire departments. To address this data gap, the Women Firefighters Biomonitoring Collaborative (WFBC) created a biological sample archive and analyzed levels of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) among women firefighters and office workers in San Francisco. 
Methods: Active duty women firefighters (n=86) and office workers (n=84) were recruited from the San Francisco Fire Department and the City and County of San Francisco, respectively. Serum samples were collected and analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) to measure and compare PFAS levels between firefighters and office workers.  For PFAS congeners detected in at least 70% of our study population, we examined differences in serum PFAS levels controlling for dietary, demographic and other confounders. Among firefighters, we assessed associations between occupational activities and PFAS levels. 
Results: Eight of 12 PFAS congeners were detected at levels above the limit of detection and seven were detected in at least 70% of the study population.  Four PFAS were detected in all study participants (PFNA, PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS). In regression models comparing  PFAS levels by occupation and adjusting for potential confounders, firefighters had higher geometric mean (GM) concentrations of PFAS compared to office workers:  2.39 (95%CI = 1.64,3.48),  2.32 (95% CI = 1.17,4.62) and 1.26 (95% CI = 0.99, 1.59) times higher for PFHxS, PFUnDA and PFNA, respectively. In analyses limited to firefighters, PFAS levels varied by assigned position in the fire department. Firefighters and officers had higher PFNA, PFOA, PFDA, and PFUnDA compared to drivers. Additionally, firefighters who reported having used firefighting foam had higher concentrations of PFOA compared firefighters who reported never having used foam.  
Conclusion:  Our study found ubiquitous exposures to PFAS among WFBC participants, with women firefighters exposed to higher levels of some PFAS compared to office workers, suggesting that some of these exposures may be occupationally related.","/content/10.1101/19005652v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005652v1.full.pdf","2019-09-11","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Analysis of corneal real astigmatism changes and high order aberration after lower eyelid epiblepharon repair surgery","Objective: To investigate changes in corneal low and high order aberrations (LOA and HOA), which cause visual disturbances after lower eyelid epiblepharon repair surgery.
Methods and analysis: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study, which included 108 eyes from 54 patients. Wavefront analyses for calibrated LOAs and HOAs (root mean square, coma, three-piece aberrations [Trefoil], secondary astigmatisms, and spherical aberrations [SA]) were performed via a Galilei G4 Dual Scheimpflug Analyzer preoperatively, at the first and second follow-ups (f/u), and at G1, G2, and G3 (<45 days, 45-75 days, and >75 days post-surgery). Several risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, and corneal keratitis presence) were assessed.
Results: In LOAs, flat keratometer (K) and axis values decreased significantly from baseline at the first f/u. At the second f/u, mean K and axis decreased. In HOAs, coma and trefoil increased from baseline at the first f/u and normalized by the second f/u. SA decreased at the second f/u and in G3. The various risk factors did not affect postoperative outcomes, axis, and secondary astigmatisms. After correcting for risk factors, at the first f/u, cylinder, coma, trefoil, and SA increased significantly from the baseline, while axis and flat K decreased. At the second f/u, cylinder increased, while axis and mean K decreased significantly from the baseline. 
Conclusion: Epiblepharon repair surgery may impact axis changes. Flat K, coma, and trefoil may be affected by mechanical force changes immediately following surgery. Mean K and SA may change with cornea state changes during healing.","/content/10.1101/19006080v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006080v1.full.pdf","2019-09-09","Ophthalmology

"RISK6, a universal 6-gene transcriptomic signature of TB disease risk, diagnosis and treatment response","Improved tuberculosis diagnostics and tools for monitoring treatment response are urgently needed. We developed a robust and simple, PCR-based host-blood transcriptomic signature, RISK6, for multiple applications: identifying individuals at risk of incident disease, as a screening test for subclinical or clinical tuberculosis, and for monitoring tuberculosis treatment. RISK6 utility was validated by blind prediction using quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR in seven independent cohorts. Prognostic performance significantly exceeded that of previous signatures discovered in the same cohort. Performance for diagnosing subclinical and clinical disease in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected persons, assessed by area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, exceeded 85%. As a screening test for tuberculosis, the sensitivity at 90% specificity met or approached the benchmarks set out in World Health Organization target product profiles for non-sputum-based tests. RISK6 scores correlated with lung immunopathology activity, measured by positron emission tomography, and tracked treatment response, demonstrating utility as treatment response biomarker, while predicting treatment failure prior to treatment initiation. Performance of the test in capillary blood samples collected by finger-prick was noninferior to venous blood collected in PAXgene tubes. These results support incorporation of RISK6 into rapid, capillary blood-based point-of-care PCR devices for prospective assessment in field studies.","/content/10.1101/19006197v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006197v1.full.pdf","2019-09-09","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Rise and Regional Disparities in Buprenorphine Utilization in the United States","Aims: Buprenorphine is an opioid partial-agonist used to treat Opioid Use Disorders (OUD). While several state and federal policy changes have attempted to increase buprenorphine availability, access remains well below optimal levels.  This study characterized how buprenorphine utilization in the United States has changed over time and whether there are regional disparities in distribution.

Measurements: Buprenorphine weights distributed from 2007 to 2017 were obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Data was expressed as the percent change and as the mg per person in each state. Separately, the formulations for prescriptions covered by Medicaid (2008 to 2018) were examined. 

Findings: Buprenorphine distributed to pharmacies increased about seven-fold (476.8 to 3,179.9 kg) while the quantities distributed to hospitals grew five-fold (18.6 to 97.6 kg) nationally from 2007 to 2017. Buprenorphine distribution per person was almost 20-fold higher in Vermont (40.4 mg/person) relative to South Dakota (2.1 mg/person). There was a strong association between the number of waivered physicians per 100K population and distribution per state (r(49) = +0.76, p < .0005). The buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film (Suboxone) was the predominant formulation (92.6% of 0.31 million Medicaid prescriptions) in 2008 but this accounted for less than three-fifths (57.3% of 6.56 million prescriptions) in 2018.

Conclusions: Although buprenorphine availability has substantially increased over the last decade, distribution was very non-homogenous across the US.","/content/10.1101/19006163v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006163v1.full.pdf","2019-09-09","Addiction Medicine

"Associations between reasons for vaping and current vaping and smoking status: Evidence from a UK based cohort","Introduction 
Given the popularity of e-cigarettes, it is important to know who vapes, why, and whether different reasons for vaping are associated with vaping and smoking status. 
Methods
In a UK cohort of young adults (23-26 years), we explored the characteristics of vapers and whether different reasons for vaping were associated with later vaping and smoking status. We used multinomial logistic regression to assess the association among ever smokers and vapers.
Results
Ever and never vapers differed in numerous demographic and behavioural characteristics. Vaping out of curiosity was associated with lower likelihood of being a current vaper (adjusted relative risk ratio [aRRR] = 0.26, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 0.12 to 0.57, p < 0.001) but a higher likelihood of being a neither user compared to a current smoker at 24 years (aRRR = 2.13, 95%CI = 1.44 to 3.17, p < 0.001). Vaping to quit smoking was associated with higher likelihood of being a dual user (aRRR = 3.21, 95%CI = 1.74 to 5.90, p < 0.001) or a current vaper (aRRR = 3.26, 95%CI = 1.62 to 6.54, p < 0.001) but a lower likelihood of being a neither user (aRRR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.34 to 0.82, p = 0.004) compared to being a current smoker at 24. 
Conclusions
Intention to quit smoking may be necessary for young people to effectively stop smoking using e-cigarettes.","/content/10.1101/19006007v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006007v1.full.pdf","2019-09-09","Epidemiology

"White adipose tissue inflammation is not attenuated by short-term calorie restriction in obese humans","Obesity is a growing global health problem due to its association with chronic low-grade inflammation contributing to metabolic complications. Multiple studies indicate that white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation can drive the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, including altered levels of cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. However, the function and regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells in human WAT under conditions of obesity and calorie restriction (CR) is not fully understood yet. Using a randomized interventional design, we investigated postmenopausal obese women who either underwent CR for three months followed by a 4 weeks phase of weight maintenance or had to maintain a stable weight over the whole study period. A comprehensive immune phenotyping protocol was conducted using validated multiparameter flow cytometry analysis in blood and subcutaneous WAT (SAT) (n=21). The T cell receptor repertoire was analyzed by next generation sequencing (n=20) and cytokine levels were determined in SAT (n=22). Metabolic parameters were determined by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and then correlated to immune cell subsets. We found that insulin resistance (IR) correlates significantly with a shift towards the memory T cell compartment in SAT. Among various T cell subsets, predominantly CD8+ effector memory T cells were associated with obesity-related IR. Interestingly, T cell receptor analysis revealed a diverse repertoire in SAT arguing against an antigen-driven intra-SAT expansion of effector memory T cells. Surprisingly, neither inflammatory cytokine levels nor leucocyte subpopulations were significantly altered upon CR. Our findings demonstrate the accumulation of effector memory T cells in obese SAT contributing to chronic inflammation. The long-standing effect of obesity-induced changes in SAT was demonstrated by preserved immune cell composition after short-term CR induced weight loss.","/content/10.1101/19005934v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005934v1.full.pdf","2019-09-09","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"The purine pathway in liver tissue biopsies from donors for transplantation is associated to immediate graft function and survival","Background & Aims: The current shortage of livers for transplantation has increased the use of organs sourced from donation after circulatory death (DCD). These organs are prone to higher incidence of graft failure, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we aimed to find biomarkers of liver function before transplantation to better inform clinical evaluation. 
Methods: Matched pre- and post-transplant liver biopsies from DCD (n=24) and donation after brain death (DBD, n=70) were collected. Liver biopsies were analysed using mass spectroscopy molecular phenotyping. First, a discrimination analysis DCD vs DBD was used to parse metabolites associated to DCD. Then a data-driven approach was used to predict Immediate Graft Function (IGF). The metabolites were tested in models to predict survival.
Results: Five metabolites in the purine pathway were selected and investigated. The ratios of: adenine monophosphate (AMP), adenine, adenosine and hypoxanthine to urate, differed between DBD and DCD biopsies at pre- transplantation stage (q<0.05). The ratios of AMP and adenine to urate also differed in biopsies from recipients undergoing IGF (q<0.05). Using random forest a panel composed by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AMP, adenine, hypoxanthine ratio to urate predicted IGF with AUC 0.84 (95% CI [0.71, 0.97]). In comparison AUC 0.71 (95%CI [0.52, 0.90]) was achieved by clinical measures. Survival analysis revealed that the metabolite classifier could stratify 6-year survival outcomes (p = 0.0073) while clinical data and donor class could not.
Conclusions: At liver pre-transplantation stage, a panel composed of purine metabolites and ALT in tissue could improve prediction of IGF and survival.","/content/10.1101/19005629v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005629v1.full.pdf","2019-09-09","Transplantation

"Against Empathy: distinct correlates of empathy and compassion with burnout and affective symptoms in health professionals and students","Concern for the well-being of medical professionals has increased considering the high rates of depression and suicidal ideation observed among medical students and residents. However, the causes of such psychological distress among health professionals are still unknown.
One possibility is that such negative outcomes arise from individual differences in how clinicians respond to the emotional states of their patients: while some tend respond with empathy (feeling what others feel), others tend respond with compassion (caring about what others feel). The aim of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that empathy is related to higher levels of burnout and affective symptoms, while compassion is related to lower levels of these outcomes. 
We surveyed 464 undergraduate students and professionals in medicine (34.3%), psychology (47%) and nursing (18.8%), 79.7% female, with a median age of 23.3. The survey included the concern and perspective taking subscales from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI); empathy and behavioral contagion from the Empathy Index (EI); the depression, anxiety, and anger subscales from PROMIS; and the Medical Student Well-Being Index (MSWBI).
Empathy was associated with higher symptoms of burnout, depression, anxiety and anger; while higher levels of compassion were associated with lower levels of these outcomes.    
Our findings provide new evidence that the well-being of medical professionals might be affected differently depending on socio-emotional traits relevant to emotional connection.","/content/10.1101/19005231v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005231v1.full.pdf","2019-09-09","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Associations Between Body Mass Index, Prostate Cancer, Advanced Prostate Cancer and Prostate Specific Antigen","Purpose
The relationship between body-mass index (BMI) and prostate cancer remains unclear. However, there is an inverse association between BMI and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), used for prostate cancer screening. We conducted this review to estimate the associations between BMI and (1) prostate cancer, (2) advanced prostate cancer, and (3) PSA.

Methods
We searched PubMed and Embase for studies until 02 October 2017 and obtained individual participant data from four studies. In total, 78 studies were identified for the association between BMI and prostate cancer, 21 for BMI and advanced prostate cancer, and 35 for BMI and PSA. We performed random-effects meta-analysis of linear associations of log PSA and prostate cancer with BMI and, to examine potential non-linearity, of associations between categories of BMI and each outcome.

Results
In the meta-analyses with continuous BMI, a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with a percentage change in PSA of -5.88% (95% CI -6.87% to -4.87%). Using BMI categories, compared to normal weight men the PSA levels of overweight men were 3.43% lower (95% CI -5.57% to -1.23%), and obese men were 12.9% lower (95% CI -15.2% to -10.7%). Prostate cancer and advanced prostate cancer analyses showed little or no evidence associations.

Conclusion
There is little or no evidence of an association between BMI and risk of prostate cancer or advanced prostate cancer, and strong evidence of an inverse and non-linear association between BMI and PSA. The association between BMI and prostate cancer is likely biased if missed diagnoses are not considered.","/content/10.1101/19005421v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005421v1.full.pdf","2019-09-09","Oncology

"Earliest infections predict the age distribution of seasonal influenza A cases","Seasonal variation in the age distribution of influenza A cases suggests that factors other than age shape susceptibility to infection. Here, we ask whether these differences can be explained in part by protection conferred by childhood influenza infection, which has lasting impacts on immune responses to influenza and protection against novel influenza A subtypes (phenomena known as original antigenic sin and immune imprinting, respectively). Fitting a statistical model to 11 years of data from studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in Marshfield, Wisconsin, we find that primary infection appears to reduce the risk of medically attended infection with that subtype throughout life and shapes the distribution of seasonal influenza A cases.   This effect is particularly strong for H1N1 (67% reduction in medically attended H1N1 infection risk, CI 55-78%) compared to H3N2 (34% reduction in medically attended H3N2 infection risk, CI 18-47%).  Additionally, we find evidence that influenza VE varies with both age and birth year, but not with the imprinting subtype per se. This suggests that VE may be sensitive to particular exposure histories. The ability to predict age-specific risk might improve forecasting models and vaccination strategies to combat seasonal influenza.","/content/10.1101/19001875v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001875v2.full.pdf","2019-09-08","Epidemiology

"Changes in association between school meals and children's dietary quality during implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010","The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 raised standards for foods sold in US schools. The aims of this paper are to estimate policy effects on dietary quality of US school-aged children, and determine if effects differed by free/reduced-price meal eligibility or age group. We estimated within-child associations between school food consumption and dietary quality (using Health Eating Index - 2010), by comparing two 24-hour dietary recalls per child from the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We used inverse probability weighting to account for population changes during this period. We scaled changes of association (implementation period versus pre-passage) by proportion of energy from school foods. School foods were 10% of annual calories, 33% on days when children ate school foods. Each percentage point of energy from school foods was associated with 0.08 more Healthy Eating Index points during implementation than pre-passage. The scaled estimated effect of policy implementation on annual dietary quality is 0.84 Healthy Eating Index points, 2.8 points on days when children eat school foods. Estimated effects were slightly greater for children eligible for free/reduced-price meals and high school-aged children, though confidence intervals include zero. The results indicate that targeted policies can improve children's dietary quality.","/content/10.1101/19005579v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005579v1.full.pdf","2019-09-08","Epidemiology

"Novel delivery of cellular therapy to reduce ischaemia reperfusion injury in kidney transplantation","Abstract: Ex-vivo normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of donor kidneys prior to transplantation provides a platform for direct delivery of cellular therapeutics to optimise organ quality prior to transplantation. Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCÂ®) possess potent immunomodulatory properties which could prove beneficial in minimising subsequent ischaemia reperfusion injury. We investigated the potential reconditioning capability of MAPC cells in kidney NMP. Methods: Pairs (5) of human kidneys from the same donor were simultaneously perfused for 7 hours. The right or left kidney was randomly allocated to receive MAPC treatment. Serial samples of perfusate, urine and tissue biopsies were taken for comparison with the control paired kidney. Results: MAPC-treated kidneys demonstrated improved urine output (p<0.01), decreased expression of the kidney injury biomarker NGAL (p<0.01), improved microvascular perfusion on contrast enhanced ultrasound (cortex p<0.05, medulla p<0.01), downregulation of IL-1ÃŸ (p<0.05) and upregulation of IL-10 (p<0.05) and Indolamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (p<0.05). A mouse model of intraperitoneal chemotaxis demonstrated decreased neutrophil recruitment when stimulated with perfusate from MAPC-treated kidneys (p<0.01). Immunofluorescence revealed pre-labelled MAPC cells home to the perivascular space in the kidneys during NMP. MAPC therapy was not associated with detrimental physiological or embolic events. Conclusion: We report the first successful delivery of cellular therapy to a kidney during NMP. Kidneys treated with MAPC cells demonstrate improvement in clinically relevant functional parameters and injury biomarkers. This novel method of cell therapy delivery provides an exciting opportunity to recondition organs prior to clinical transplantation.","/content/10.1101/19005546v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005546v1.full.pdf","2019-09-08","Transplantation

"Increased Frequency of Acute Illness and Hospitalizations in Infants and Toddlers with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia","Purpose: Infants and toddlers with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are at high risk for adrenal crisis and associated sequelae. To better understand acute illness at this early age, we determined the frequency and severity of acute illness and hospitalizations between 0-4 years of age, both within CAH and compared to controls. We also evaluated the impact of pre-hospital stress-dose hydrocortisone on Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospitalizations.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 40 CAH youth and 27 age-matched controls at a tertiary center. Characteristics of acute illnesses during the first 4 years of life were recorded, including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, ED visits, hospitalizations, abnormal electrolytes, and stress-dose hydrocortisone usage. 
Results: CAH youth had more frequent illnesses requiring stress-dosing when they were younger than 2 years old [4.0 (1.0-6.0)] compared to when they were 2-4 years old [3.0 (1.0-4.0), P < 0.05], with the most illnesses during their first year of life. As well, CAH infants and toddlers had more hospitalizations younger than 2 years old compared to 2-4 years old (36 vs 2). 25% (3/12) of CAH youth with abnormal electrolytes in the ED did not receive any stress-dosing (oral/IM) prior to the ED, and only 25% (3/12) had received intramuscular hydrocortisone at home. CAH youth had more frequent ED visits (7.4 times as many) and hospitalizations (38 to 0) compared to controls.
Conclusions: Very young children with classical CAH are at high risk for acute illness and hospitalizations during their first 2 years of life, and do not receive adequate stress-dosing prior to the ED despite appropriate education. Our findings underscore the need for earlier recognition of acute illness in this vulnerable population and improved education regarding administration of stress-dose hydrocortisone to prevent morbidity.","/content/10.1101/19005462v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005462v1.full.pdf","2019-09-05","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Determinants of first aid knowledge and basic practice among elementary school teachers in Debre Tabor City, Northwest Ethiopia","Abstract 
Background: Unpremeditated injuries are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in pediatrics population, especially in low and middle-income countries. Giving immediate help for an injured child is a crucial step for saving the child from further disability and/or death. This study aimed to assess the determinant factors of first aid knowledge and basic practice among elementary school teachers in Debre Tabor, Ethiopia.
Method: Institution based cross-sectional study was employed in Debre Tabor City. Single population proportion formula was used for sample size calculation and a total of 216 elementary school teachers were included in study. Simple random sampling technique with proportional allocation was applied for selections of the study participant. Data entry was done by Epi data version 3.1 and the data was exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to identify determinants of knowledge on first aid. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were used to determine the significance and strength of association at 95% confidence interval.
Result: Our study revealed that 45.8% of the subjects were knowledgeable on first aid. More than 75% of study participant reported that they have encountered a child who need first aid. Among this 64% of them provide first aid. The multivariable analysis revealed that service year (AOR=3.51, 95%CI: (1.06, 11.59)), educational status (AOR=12.15, 95%CI: (3.17, 46.67)), previous first aid training (AOR=0.43, 95%CI: (0.21, 0.87)) and information about first aid (AOR=0.12, 95%CI ;( 0.03, 0.48)) were found to be significantly associated with having knowledge on first aid. 
Conclusion: School teachers have low knowledge on first aid. Educational status, service year, previous first aid training and information on first aid were the predictor of first aid knowledge. Introducing essential first aid training in the curriculum during teachers training shall be considered.","/content/10.1101/19005439v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005439v1.full.pdf","2019-09-05","Pediatrics

"Opioid Overdose in Ohio: Comprehensive Analysis of Associated Socioeconomic Factors","Objective: Our study focused on identifying socioeconomic factors associated with death by opioid overdose in Ohio communities at the census tract level.
Materials and Methods: A large-scale vital statistic dataset from Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and U.S. Census datasets were used to obtain opioid-related death rate and socioeconomic characteristics for all census tracts in Ohio. Regression analysis was performed to identify the relationships between socioeconomic factors of census tracts and the opioid-related death rate for both urban and rural tracts.  
Results: In Ohio from 2010-2016, whites, males, and people aged 25-44 had the highest opioid-related death rates. At the census tract level, higher death rates were associated with certain socioeconomic characteristics (e.g. percentage of the census tract population living in urban areas, percentage divorced/separated, percentage of vacant housing units). Predominately rural areas had a different population composition than urban areas, and death rates in rural areas exhibited fewer associations with socioeconomic characteristics. 
Discussion: Predictive models of opioid-related death rates based on census tract-level characteristics held for urban areas more than rural ones, reflecting the recently observed rural- to- urban geographic shift in opioid-related deaths. Future research is needed to examine the geographic distribution of opioid abuse throughout Ohio and in other states.
Conclusion: Regression analysis identified associations between population characteristics and opioid-related death rates of Ohio census tracts. These analyses can help government officials and law official workers prevent, predict and combat opioid abuse at the community level.","/content/10.1101/19005140v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005140v1.full.pdf","2019-09-05","Epidemiology

"Comprehensive Spatiotemporal Analysis of Opioid Poisoning Mortality in Ohio from 2010 to 2016","Objective:
We aimed to identify (1) differences in opioid poisoning mortality among population groups, (2) geographic clusters of opioid-related deaths over time, and (3) health conditions co-occurring with opioid-related death in Ohio by computational analysis.
Materials and Methods:
We used a large-scale Ohio vital statistic dataset from the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and U.S. Census data from 2010-2016. We surveyed population differences with demographic profiling and use of relative proportions, conducted spatiotemporal pattern analysis with spatial autocorrelation via Moran statistics at the census tract level, and performed comorbidity analysis using frequent itemset mining and association rule mining. 
Results:
Our analyses found higher rates of opioid-related death in people aged 25-54, whites, and males. We also found that opioid-related deaths in Ohio became more spatially concentrated during 2010-2016, and tended to be most clustered around Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. Drug abuse, anxiety and cardiovascular disease were found to predict opioid-related death.
Discussion:
Comprehensive data-driven spatiotemporal analysis of opioid-related deaths provides essential identification of demographic, geographic and health factors related to opioid abuse. Future research should access personal health information for more detailed comorbidity analysis, as well as expand spatiotemporal models for real-time use.
Conclusion:
Computational analyses revealed demographic differences in opioid poisoning, changing regional patterns of opioid-related deaths, and health conditions co-occurring with opioid overdose for Ohio from 2010-2016, providing essential knowledge for both government officials and caregivers to establish policies and strategies to best combat the opioid epidemic.","/content/10.1101/19005454v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005454v1.full.pdf","2019-09-04","Epidemiology

"Modified Long-Axis In-Plane Ultrasound Versus Short-Axis Out-of-Plane Ultrasound For Radial Arterial Cannulation:A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND Given a low first-pass success rate of the conventional SAX (short-axis) or LAX (long-axis) approach, ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation in adults with radial artery diameter less than 2.2 mm may be still challenging. 
OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of modified long-axis in-plane(M-LAIP) versus short-axis out-of-plane (SAOP) or conventional palpation(C-P) approaches for ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation.
DESIGN A prospective, randomized and controlled trial.
SETTING Operating room in a tertiary university hospital, from 1 July 2018 to 24 November 2018.
PATIENTS A total of 201 patients (age 18 to 85 years, the diameter of the radial artery less 2.2 mm) were included. Patients with history of forearm surgery, ulnar artery occlusion, abnormal Allen test, etc, were excluded from this study.
INTERVENTIONS All patients were randomized 1:1:1 to M-LAIP, SAOP or C-P. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the cannulation success rate. Secondary outcomes included first location time and cannulation time, number of attempts.
RESULTS The cannulation success rate was significantly higher in the M-LAIP group than in the SAOP group or C-P group (first success rate: 80.3% vs 53.8% or 33.8%; p =0.000; total success rate: 93.9% vs 78.5% or 50.8%; p =0.000). First location time (s) was significantly longer in the M-LAIP group compared with the SAOP group (31(28-35[12-44]) vs 15(14-17[10-21]); p =0.000) and the C-P group (31(28-35[12-44]) vs 12(8-13.5 [6-37]); p =0.000). However, the time of cannulation in the M-LAIP group (29(24-45[16-313])) was significantly shorter than that in the SAOP group (45(28.5-135.5[14-346]), p =0.002) and in the C-P group(138(27-308[12-363]), p =0.000). The number of attempts decreased in the M-LAIP group compared with SAOP or C-P group. 
 CONCLUSION The M-LAIP procedure for ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation can offer a higher success rate of the first-attempt and total cannulation, fewer attempts and less time of cannulation.","/content/10.1101/19005496v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005496v1.full.pdf","2019-09-04","Anesthesia

"Identifying 31 novel breast cancer susceptibility loci using data from genome-wide association studies conducted in Asian and European women","Common genetic variants in 183 loci have been identified in relation to breast cancer risk in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These risk variants combined explain only a relatively small proportion of breast cancer heritability, particularly in Asian populations. To search for additional genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer, we performed a meta-analysis of data from GWAS conducted in Asians (24,206 cases and 24,775 controls). Variants showing an association with breast cancer risk at P < 0.01 were evaluated in GWAS conducted in European women including 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls. In the combined analysis of data from both Asian and European women, the lead variant in 28 loci not previously reported showed an association with breast cancer risk at P < 5 x10-8. In the meta-analysis of all GWAS data from Asian and European descendants, we identified SNPs in three additional loci in association with breast cancer risk at P < 5 x10-8. The associations for 10 of these loci were replicated in an independent sample of 16,787 cases and 16,680 controls of Asian women (P < 0.05). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and gene-based analyses provided evidence for the possible involvement of the YBEY, MAN2C1, SNUPN, TBX1, SEMA4A, STC1, MUTYH, LOXL2, and LINC00886 genes underlying the associations observed in eight of these 28 newly identified risk loci. In addition, we replicated the association for 78 of the 166 previously reported risk variants at P < 0.05 in women of Asian descent using GWAS data. These findings improve our understanding of breast cancer genetics and etiology and extend to Asian populations previous findings from studies of European women.","/content/10.1101/19003855v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003855v1.full.pdf","2019-09-04","Epidemiology

"Impact of spectrograms on the classification of wheezes and crackles in an educational setting. An interrater study.","Background: Chest auscultation is a widely used method in the diagnosis of lung diseases. However, the interpretation of lung sounds is a subjective task and disagreements arise. New technological developments like the use of visual representation of sounds through spectrograms could improve the agreement when classifying lung sounds, but this is not yet known. 
Aims: To test if the use of spectrograms improves the agreement when classifying wheezes and crackles. 
Methods: We used 30 lung sounds recordings. The sample contained 15 normal recordings and 15 with wheezes or crackles. We produced spectrograms of the recordings. Twenty-three third to fifth-year medical students at UiT the Arctic University of Norway classified the recordings using an online questionnaire.  We first showed the students examples of how wheezes and crackles looked in the spectrogram. Then, we played the recordings in a random order two times, first without the spectrogram, then with live spectrograms displayed. We asked them to classify the sounds for the presence of wheezes and crackles. We calculated kappa values for the agreement between each student and the expert classification with and without display of spectrograms and tested for significant improvement. We also calculated Fleiss kappa for the 23 observers with and without the spectrogram. 
Results: When classifying wheezes 13/23 (1 with p<.05) students had a positive change in k, and 16/23 (2 with p<.05). All the statistically significant changes were in the direction of improved kappa values (.52 - .75). Fleiss kappa values were k=.51 and k=.56 (p=.63) for wheezes without and with spectrograms. For crackles, these values were k=.22 and k=.40 (p=0.01) in the same order. 
Conclusions: The use of spectrograms had a positive impact on the inter-rater agreement and the agreement with experts. We observed a higher improvement in the classification of crackles compared to wheezes.","/content/10.1101/19005504v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005504v1.full.pdf","2019-08-31","Medical Education

"High occurrence of transportation and logistics occupations among vascular dementia patients: an observational study","Background: Growing evidence suggests a role of occupation in the emergence and manifestation of dementia. Occupations are often defined by complexity level, although working environments and activities differ in several other important ways. We aimed to capture the multi-faceted nature of occupation through its measurement as a categorical (instead of quantitative) variable and explored its relationship with different types of dementia.
Methods: We collected occupational history data of 2121 dementia patients with various suspected etiologies from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (mean age: 67, SD=8, 57% male, mean MMSE: 21, SD=5). Our final sample included individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia (n=1467), frontotemporal dementia (n=281), vascular dementia (n=98), Lewy Body diseae (n=174) and progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration (n=101). Within the AD group, we used neuropsychological data to further characterize patients by clinical phenotypes. All participants were categorized into one of 11 occupational classes, across which we evaluated the distribution of dementia (sub)types with Chi2 analyses. We gained further insight into occupation-dementia relationships through post-hoc logistic regressions that included various demographic and health characteristics as explanatory variables.
Results: There were significant differences in the distribution of dementia types across occupation groups (Chi2=85.87, p<.001). Vascular dementia was relatively common in the Transportation/Logistics sector, and higher vascular risk factors partly explained this relationship. Alzheimer's disease occurred less in Transportation/Logistics and more in Health Care/Welfare occupations, which related to a higher/lower percentage of males. We found no relationships between occupational classes and clinical phenotypes of AD (Chi2=53.65, n.s.).
Conclusions: Relationships between occupation and dementia exist beyond complexity level, which offers new opportunities for disease prevention and improvement of occupational health policy.","/content/10.1101/19005512v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005512v1.full.pdf","2019-08-31","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Characteristics of Cardiac Memory in Patients with Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillator: the CAMI study","Background: Cardiac memory (CM) was known as a repolarization phenotype, an adaptive response of the heart on abnormal ventricular activation. The goal of this study was to determine factors associated with CM in patients receiving implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD). We hypothesized that preexisted cardiac remodeling is associated with CM.
Methods: Patients with structural heart disease (n=20; mean age 72.6 Â± 11.6 y; 80% male; mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 31.7 Â± 7.6%; history of myocardial infarction (MI) in 75%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 85%) and preserved atrioventricular (AV) conduction received primary (80%) or secondary (20%) prevention dual chamber ICD. Standard 12-lead ECG was recorded in AAI and DDD mode, immediately after ICD implant and after 7 days of right ventricular (RV) pacing in DDD mode with short AV delay. Direction (azimuth and elevation) and magnitude of spatial QRS, T, and ventricular gradient (SVG) vectors were measured immediately after implant and after 7 days of RV pacing. CM was quantified as the degree of alignment between QRSDDD-7 and TAAI-7 vectors (QRSDDD-7-TAAI-7 angle). Circular statistics and mixed models with a random slope and intercept were adjusted for days 1-7 change in cardiac activation, LVEF, known risk factors, and use of medications known to affect CM.
Results: QRSDDD-7-TAAI-7 angle strongly correlated (circular r = - 0.972; P<0.0001) with TAAI-7-TDDD-7 angle. Baseline TDDD-1 azimuth correlated with QRSAAI-7-QRSDDD-7 angle (circular r = 0.604; P<0.001). In the mixed models, history of MI (-180(95%CI -320 to -40 Â° ); P=0.011) and female sex (-162(95%CI -268 to -55 Â° ); P=0.003) counteracted CM-T azimuth changes (+132(95%CI 80-184 Â° ); P<0.0001). History of VT (+27(95%CI 4-46) mV*ms; P=0.007) amplified CM-T area increase (+15(95%CI 6-24) mV*ms; P<0.0001).
Conclusions: Existing cardiac remodeling due to MI and VT significantly affect the degree of CM in response to RV pacing. Women develop less CM than men. Activation memory manifests as a smaller angle between QRS vectors of normal and abnormal activation.","/content/10.1101/19005181v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005181v1.full.pdf","2019-08-30","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Identifying subtypes of a stigmatized medical condition","Background: 
Some conditions - such as obesity, depression and functional odor disorders - come with a social stigma. Understanding the etiology of these conditions helps to avoid stereotypes and find remedies. One of the major obstacles facing researchers, especially for those studying socially distressing metabolic malodor, is the difficulty in assembling biologically homogeneous study cohorts.

Objective:
The aim of this study was to examine phenotypic variance, self-reported data and laboratory tests for the purpose of identifying clinically relevant and etiologically meaningful subtypes of idiopathic body odor and the 'People are Allergic To Me' (PATM) syndrome.

Methods:
Participants with undiagnosed body odor conditions enrolled to participate in this research study initiated by a healthcare charity MEBO Research and sponsored by Wishart Research group at the Metabolomics Innovation Centre, University of Alberta, Canada. Primary outcomes were differences in metabolite concentrations measured in urine, blood and breath of test and control groups. Principal component analyses and other statistical tests were carried out for these measurements.

Results:
While neither of existing laboratory tests could reliably predict chronic malodor symptoms, several measurements distinguished phenotypes at a significance level less than 5%. Types of malodor can be differentiated by self-reported consumption of (or sensitivity to) added sugars (p<0.01), blood alcohols after glucose challenge (especially ethanol: p<0.0005), urinary excretion of phenylalanine, putrescine, and combinations of blood or urine metabolites. 

Conclusions:
Our preliminary results suggest that malodor heterogeneity can be addressed by analyses of phenotypes based on patients' dietary and olfactory observations. Our studies highlight the need for more trials. Future research focused on comprehensive metabolomics and microbiome sequencing will play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of malodor.","/content/10.1101/19005223v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005223v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Where should new parkrun events be located? Modelling the potential impact of 200 new events on socio-economic inequalities in access and participation.","Background
parkrun, an international movement which organises free weekly 5km running events, has been widely praised for encouraging inactive individuals to participate in physical activity. Recently, parkrun received funding to establish 200 new events across England, specifically targeted at deprived communities. This study aims to investigate the relationships between geographic access, deprivation, and participation in parkrun, and to inform the planned expansion by proposing future event locations.

Methods
We conducted an ecological spatial analysis, using data on 455 parkrun events, 2,842 public green spaces, and 32,844 English census areas. Poisson regression was applied to investigate the relationships between the distances to events, deprivation, and parkrun participation rates. Model estimates were incorporated into a location-allocation analysis, to identify locations for future events that maximise deprivation-weighted parkrun participation.

Results
The distance to the nearest event (in km) and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (score) were both independently negatively associated with local parkrun participation rates. Rate ratios were 0.921 (95%CI = 0.921-0.922) and 0.959 (0.959-0.959), respectively. The recommended 200 new event locations were estimated to increase weekly runs by 6.9% (from 82,824 to 88,506). Of the additional runs, 4.1% (n=231) were expected to come from the 10% most deprived communities.

Conclusion
Participation in parkrun is wide spread across England. We provide recommendations for new parkrun event location, in order to increase participation from deprived communities. However, the creation of new events alone is unlikely to be an effective strategy. Further research is needed to study how barriers to participation can be reduced.","/content/10.1101/19004143v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004143v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","Public and Global Health

"Clinical benefits and adverse effects of genetically-elevated free testosterone levels: a Mendelian randomization analysis","BACKGROUND: Testosterone products are increasingly being prescribed to males for a variety of possible health benefits but the causal relationship between testosterone and health-related outcomes is unclear. Evidence from well-powered randomized controlled trials are difficult to obtain, particularly regarding effects on long-term or adverse outcomes. We sought to determine the effects of genetically-predicted calculated free testosterone (CFT) on 23 health outcomes.
METHODS: Genetic variants associated with CFT were determined from 136,531 white British males in the UK Biobank. One-sample and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to infer the effects of genetically-predicted CFT on 23 health outcomes selected based on relevance with known or suspected effects of testosterone therapy.
FINDINGS: In males from the UK Biobank, 81 independent genetic variants were associated with CFT levels at genome-wide significance (p<5x10-8). Each 0.1 nmol/L increase in genetically-predicted CFT was associated with clinical benefits on increased heel bone mineral density (0.053 SD; 95% CI = 0.038 to 0.068; p=8.77x10-12) and decreased body fat percentage (-1.86%; 95% CI = -2.35 to -1.37; p=1.56x10-13), and adverse effects on increased risk of prostate cancer (OR=1.28; 95% CI=1.11 to 1.49; p=1.0x10-3), risk of androgenic alopecia (OR=1.82; 95% CI = 1.55 to 2.14; p=3.52x10-13), risk of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) (OR=1.81; 95% CI = 1.34 to 2.44; p=1.05x10-4) and hematocrit percentage (1.49%; 95% CI = 1.24 to 1.74; p=3.49x10-32).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term elevated free testosterone levels cause prostate cancer, BPH, and hair loss while reducing body fat percentage and increasing bone density. It also has a neutral effect on type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and cognitive outcomes. Well powered randomized trials are needed to address the effects of shorter term use of exogenous testosterone on these outcomes.","/content/10.1101/19005132v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005132v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Identification of host-pathogen-disease relationships using a scalable Multiplex Serology platform in UK Biobank","Background: Certain infectious agents are recognised causes of cancer and potentially other chronic diseases. Identifying associations and understanding pathological mechanisms involving infectious agents and subsequent chronic disease risk will be possible through measuring exposure to multiple infectious agents in large-scale prospective cohorts such as UK Biobank.
Methods: Following expert consensus we designed a Multiplex Serology platform capable of simultaneously measuring quantitative antibody responses against 45 antigens from 20 infectious agents implicated in non-communicable diseases, including human herpes, hepatitis, polyoma, papilloma, and retroviruses, as well as Chlamydia trachomatis, Helicobacter pylori and Toxoplasma gondii. This panel was assayed in a random subset of UK Biobank participants (n=9,695) to test associations between infectious agents and recognised demographic and genetic risk factors and disease outcomes.
Findings: Seroprevalence estimates for each infectious agent were consistent with those expected from the literature. The data confirmed epidemiological associations of infectious agent antibody responses with sociodemographic characteristics (e.g. lifetime sexual partners with C. trachomatis; P=1.8x10-149), genetic variants (e.g. rs6927022 with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA1 antibodies, P=9.5x10-91) and disease outcomes including human papillomavirus-16 seropositivity and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (odds ratio 2.28, 95% confidence interval 1.38-3.63), and quantitative EBV viral capsid antigen responses and multiple sclerosis through genetic correlation (MHC rG=0.30, P=0.01).
Interpretation: This dataset, intended as a pilot study to demonstrate applicability of Multiplex Serology in epidemiological studies, is itself one of the largest studies to date covering diverse infectious agents in a prospective UK cohort including those traditionally under-represented in population cohorts such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 and C. trachomatis. Our results emphasise the validity of our Multiplex Serology approach in large-scale epidemiological studies opening up opportunities for improving our understanding of host-pathogen-disease relationships. These data are available to researchers interested in examining the relationship between infectious agents and human health.","/content/10.1101/19004960v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004960v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"A systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of an early invasive strategy compared to a conservative approach in elderly patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome","Background: Elderly patients, 65 years old and older, largely represent (>50 %) of hospital-admitted patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Data are conflicting comparing efficacy of early routine invasive (within 48-72 hours of initial evaluation) versus conservative management of ACS in this population. 
Objective: We aimed to determine the effectiveness of routine early invasive strategy compared to conservative treatment in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events in elderly patients with non-ST elevation (NSTE) ACS.
Data Sources: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials through PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar database. 
Study Selection: The studies included were randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of invasive strategy compared to conservative treatment among elderly patients > 65 years old diagnosed with NSTEACS. Studies were included if they assessed any of the following outcomes of death, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, recurrent angina, and need for revascularization. Five articles were subsequently included in the meta-analysis. 
Data Extraction: Three independent reviewers extracted the data of interest from the articles using a standardized data collection form that included study quality indicators. Disparity in assessment was settled by an independent adjudicator.
Data Synthesis: All pooled analyses were based on fixed effects model. A total of 2,495 patients were included, 1337 in the invasive strategy group, and 1158 in the conservative treatment group. Results: Meta-analysis showed less incidence of revascularization in the invasive (2%) over conservative treatment groups (8%), with overall risk ratio of 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.61, I2 =0%). There was also less incidence of stroke in the invasive (2%) versus conservative group (3%) but this was not statistically significant. A significant benefit was noted in the reduction of all-cause mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.55-0.72, I2=84%) and myocardial infarction (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49-0.79, I2=63%) but with significant heterogeneity. 
Conclusion: There was a significantly lower rate of revascularization in the invasive strategy group compared to the conservative treatment group. In the reduction of all-cause mortality and MI, there was benefit favoring invasive strategy but with significant heterogeneity. These findings do not support the bias against early routine invasive intervention in the elderly group with NSTEACS. However, further studies focusing on the elderly with larger population sizes are still needed.","/content/10.1101/19004044v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004044v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","Cardiovascular Medicine

"The Impact of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for Human Immunodeficiency Virus on Gonorrhea Prevalence","Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be highly effective in reducing the risk of HIV infection in gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (GbMSM). However, PrEP does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  In some populations, PrEP has also led to riskier behaviour such as reduced condom usage, with the result that the prevalence of bacterial STIs like gonorrhea has increased. Here we develop a compartmental model of the transmission of HIV and gonorrhea, and the impacts of PrEP, condom usage, STI testing frequency and potential changes in sexual risk behaviour stemming from the introduction of PrEP in a population of GbMSM.  We find that introducing PrEP causes an increase in gonorrhea prevalence for a wide range of parameter values, including at the current recommended frequency of STI testing once every 3 months for individuals on PrEP.  Moreover, the model predicts that a higher STI testing frequency alone is not enough to prevent a rise in gonorrhea prevalence, unless the testing frequency is increased to impractical levels.  However, testing every 2 months in combination with sufficiently high condom usage by individuals on PrEP would be successful in maintaining gonorrhea prevalence at pre-PrEP levels. The results emphasize that programs making PrEP more available should be accompanied by efforts to support condom usage and frequent STI testing, in order to avoid an increase in the prevalence of gonorrhea and other bacterial STIs.","/content/10.1101/19005207v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005207v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","HIV/AIDS

"Systematic analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in human endometrial cancer: a retrospective study","Objective:
The prognostic effect of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) on endometrial cancer (EMC) has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we systematically analyzed the role of TIICs in EMC development.
Methods: 
Patient data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We comprehensively analyzed TIIC population in EMC tissue and their role in EMC progression and prognosis by using a deconvolution algorithm (CIBERSORT) and clinically annotated expression profiles. 
Results:
The proportions of gamma delta T cells, resting NK cells, M1 macrophages, and resting mast cells were significantly different in normal endometrium and EMC tissue. The proportion of CD8+ T cells, resting memory CD4 T cells, and M0 macrophages was reversed middle correlated. The proportion of resting dendritic cells, resting memory CD4 T cells, and T regulatory cells (Tregs) decreased in accordance with the cancer cell differentiation grade (G); the lower proportion of activated dendritic cells and gamma delta T cells and higher proportion of Tregs predicted longer EMC survival time and vice versa. The low proportion of gamma delta T cells indicated better response to therapy.
Conclusion:
Collectively, our data suggested subtle differences in the cellular composition of TIICs in EMC, and these differences were likely to be important determinants of both prognosis and therapy of EMC.","/content/10.1101/19003707v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003707v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","Obstetrics and Gynecology

"Classifying dementia progression using microbial profiling of saliva","Introduction: There is increasing evidence linking periodontal infections to Alzheimer's disease. Saliva sampling can reveal information about the host and pathogen interactions that can inform about physiological and pathological brain states.
Methods: A cross-sectional cohort of age-matched subjects (78) was segmented according to their chemosensory (University of Pennsylvania smell identification test; UPSIT) and cognitive scores (mini-mental score evaluation; MMSE and clinical dementia rating; CDR). Mid-morning saliva was sampled from each subject and processed for microbiome composition and cytokine analysis. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to unravel specific changes in microbial and immunological signatures and logistic regression analysis (LRA) was employed to identify taxa that varied in abundance among patients' groups.
Results: Using olfaction we distinguish in the cognitively normal population a segment with high chemosensory scores (CNh, 27) and another segment with chemosensory scores (CNr, 16) as low as MCI (21) but higher than the AD group (17). We could identify stage-specific microbial signatures changes but no clear distinct cytokine profiles. Periodontal pathogen species as F. villosus decline with increasing severity of AD while opportunistic oral bacteria as L. Wadei shows a significant enrichment MCI. Conclusions: The salivary microbiome indicates stage-dependent changes in oral bacteria favoring opportunistic bacteria at the expenses of periodontal bacteria, while the inflammatory profiles remain mainly unchanged in the sampled population.","/content/10.1101/19004820v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004820v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","Neurology

"Physician Suicide: A Scoping Review to Highlight Opportunities for Prevention","Objective: The aim of this scoping review is to map the current landscape of published research and perspectives on physician suicide. Findings could serve as a roadmap for further investigations and potentially inform efforts to prevent physician suicide. 

Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Scopus were searched for English-language publications from August 21, 2017 through April 28, 2018. Inclusion criteria were a primary outcome or thesis focused on suicide (including suicide completion, attempts, and thoughts or ideation) among medical students, postgraduate trainees, or attending physicians. Opinion articles were included. Studies that were non-English, or those that only mentioned physician burnout, mental health or substance use disorders were excluded. Data extraction was performed by two authors. 

Results: The search yielded 1,596 articles, of which 347 articles passed to the full-text review round. The oldest article was an editorial from 1903; 210 (60.3%) articles were published from 2000 to present. Authors originated from 37 countries and 143 (41.2%) were opinion articles. Most discussed were suicide risk factors and culture of practice issues, while least discussed themes included public health and postvention. 

Conclusions: Consistency and reliability of data and information about physician suicides could be improved. Data limitations partly contribute to these issues. Also, various suicide risk factors for physicians have been explored, and several remain poorly understood. Based on this scoping review, a public health approach, including surveillance and early warning systems, investigations of sentinel cases, and postvention may be impactful next steps in preventing physician deaths by suicide.","/content/10.1101/19004465v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004465v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","Medical Education

"Apolipoprotein B underlies the causal relationship of circulating blood lipids with coronary heart disease","Background: Circulating blood lipids cause coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the precise way in which one or more lipoprotein lipid-related entities account for this relationship remains unclear. We sought to explore the causal relationships of blood lipid traits with risk of CHD using multivariable Mendelian randomization.

Methods: We conducted GWAS of circulating blood lipid traits in UK Biobank (up to n=440,546) for LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B to identify lipid-associated SNPs. Using data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D for CHD (consisting of 60,801 cases and 123,504 controls), we performed univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Similar analyses were conducted for HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I.

Findings: GWAS identified multiple independent SNPs associated at P<5x10-8 for LDL cholesterol (220), apolipoprotein B (n=255), triglycerides (440), HDL cholesterol (534) and apolipoprotein AI (440). Between 56-93% of SNPs identified for each lipid trait had not been previously reported in large-scale GWAS. Almost half (46%) of these SNPs were associated at P<5x10-8 with more than one lipid related trait. Assessed individually using MR, each of LDL cholesterol (OR 1.66 per 1 standard deviation higher trait; 95%CI: 1.49; 1.86; P=2.4x10-19), triglycerides (OR 1.34; 95%CI: 1.25, 1.44; P=9.1x10-16) and apolipoprotein B (OR 1.73; 95%CI: 1.56, 1.91; P=1.5x10-25) had effect estimates consistent with a higher risk of CHD. In multivariable MR, only apolipoprotein B (OR 1.92; 95%CI: 1.31, 2.81; P=7.5x10-4) retained a robust effect with the estimate for LDL cholesterol (OR 0.85; 95%CI: 0.57; 1.27; P=0.44) reversing and that of triglycerides (OR 1.12; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.23; P=0.01) becoming markedly weaker.
Individual MR analyses showed a 1-SD higher HDL-C (OR 0.80; 95%CI: 0.75, 0.86; P=1.7x10-10) and apolipoprotein A-I (OR 0.83; 95%CI: 0.77, 0.89; P=1.0x10-6) to lower the risk of CHD but these effect estimates weakened to include the null on accounting for apolipoprotein B.

Conclusions: Apolipoprotein B is of fundamental causal relevance in the aetiology of CHD, and underlies the relationship of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with CHD.","/content/10.1101/19004895v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004895v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Pre-diagnostic loss to follow-up in an active case-finding TB program: a mixed-methods study from rural Bihar, India","Background
Despite active case-finding (ACF) identifying more presumptive and confirmed TB cases, high pre-diagnostic loss to follow-up (PDLFU) among presumptive TB cases referred for diagnostic test remains a concern. We aimed to quantify the PDLFU, and identify the barriers and enablers in undergoing a diagnostic evaluation in an ACF program implemented in 1.02 million rural population in the Samastipur district of Bihar, India.

Methods
During their routine work, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA, a community health worker or CHW), informal providers, and community laypersons identified people at risk of TB, and referred them to the program. A field coordinator (FC) screened them for TB symptoms at the patient's home. The identified presumptive TB cases were accompanied by the CHW to a designated government facility for diagnostics. Those with a confirmed TB diagnosis were put on treatment by the CHW and followed-up till treatment completion. All services were provided free of cost and patients were supported throughout the care pathway, including a transport allowance. We analyzed programmatically collected data, conducted in-depth interviews with patients, and focus group discussions with the CHWs and FCs in an explanatory mixed-methods design. 

Results
A total of 11146 presumptive TB cases were identified from January 2018 to December 2018, out of which 4912 (44.1%) underwent a diagnostic evaluation. The key enablers were CHW accompaniment and support in addition to the free TB services in the public sector. The major barriers identified were transport challenges, deficient family and health provider support, and poor services in the public system.

Conclusion
If we are to find missing cases, the health system needs urgent reform, and diagnostic services need to be patient-centric.

"Descriptive epidemiology of physical activity energy expenditure in UK adults. The Fenland Study."," Background:  Physical activity (PA) plays a role in the prevention of a range of diseases including obesity and cardiometabolic disorders. Large population-based descriptive studies of PA, incorporating precise measurement, are needed to understand the relative burden of insufficient PA levels and to inform the tailoring of interventions. Combined heart and movement sensing enables the study of physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and intensity distribution. We aimed to describe the sociodemographic correlates of PAEE and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in UK adults. 

  Methods:  The Fenland study is a population-based cohort study of 12,435 adults aged 29 to 64 years-old in Cambridgeshire, UK. Following individual calibration (treadmill), participants wore a combined heart rate and movement sensor continuously for 6 days in free-living, from which we derived PAEE (kJÂ·day-1Â·kg-1) and time in MVPA (>3 & >4 METs) in bouts greater than 1 minute and 10 minutes. Socio-demographic information was self-reported. Stratum-specific summary statistics and multivariable analyses were performed. 

 Results:  Women accumulated a mean(sd) 50(20) kJÂ·day-1Â·kg-1 of PAEE, and 83(67) and 33(39) minutesÂ·day-1 of 1-min bouted and 10-min bouted MVPA respectively. By contrast, men recorded 59(23) kJÂ·day-1Â·kg-1, 124(84) and 60(58) minutesÂ·day-1. Age and BMI were also important correlates of PA. Association with age was inverse in both sexes, more strongly so for PAEE than MVPA. Obese individuals accumulated less PA than their normal-weight counterparts whether considering PAEE or allometrically-scaled PAEE (-10 kJÂ·day-1Â·kg-1 vs kJÂ·day-1Â·kg-2/3 in men). Higher income and manual work were associated with higher PA; manual workers recorded 13-16 kJÂ·kg-1Â·day-1 more PAEE than sedentary counterparts. Overall, 86% of women and 96% of men accumulated 21.4 minutesÂ·day-1 of MVPA (>3 METs) on average (150 minutes per week). These values were 49% and 74% if only considering bouts >10 min (15% and 31% for >4 METs).  

 Conclusions:  PA varied by age, sex and BMI, and was higher in manual workers and those with higher incomes. Light physical activity was the main driver of PAEE; a component of PA that is currently not quantified as a target in UK guidelines.","/content/10.1101/19003442v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003442v1.full.pdf","2019-08-27","Epidemiology

"Estimating the health impact of vaccination against 10 pathogens in 98 low and middle income countries from 2000 to 2030","Background

The last two decades have seen substantial expansion of childhood vaccination programmes in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Here we quantify the health impact of these programmes by estimating the deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted by vaccination with ten antigens in 98 LMICs between 2000 and 2030.

Methods

Independent research groups provided model-based disease burden estimates under a range of vaccination coverage scenarios for ten pathogens: hepatitis B (HepB), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), human papillomavirus (HPV), Japanese encephalitis (JE), measles, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (MenA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, rubella, yellow fever. Using standardized demographic data and vaccine coverage estimates for routine and supplementary immunization activities, the impact of vaccination programmes on deaths and DALYs was determined by comparing model estimates from the no vaccination counterfactual scenario with those from a default coverage scenario. We present results in two forms: deaths/DALYs averted in a particular calendar year, and in a particular annual birth cohort.

Findings

We estimate that vaccination will have averted 70 (2.5-97.5% quantile range 54-80) million deaths between 2000 and 2030 across the 98 countries and ten pathogens considered, 35 (30-40) million of these between 2000-2018. From 2000-2018, this represents a 41% (36-44%) reduction in deaths due to the ten pathogens relative to the no vaccination counterfactual. Most (95% (93-99%)) of this impact is in under-five age mortality, notably from measles. Over the lifetime of birth cohorts born between 2000 and 2030, we predict that 121 (102-136) million deaths will be averted by vaccination, of which 58 (31-82) and 38 (10-81) million are due to measles and Hepatitis B vaccination, respectively. We estimate that recent increases in vaccine coverage and introductions of additional vaccines will result in a 72% (64-75%) reduction in lifetime mortality caused by these 10 pathogens in the 2018 birth cohort.

Interpretation

Increases in vaccine coverage and the introduction of new vaccines into LMICs over the last two decades have had a major impact in reducing mortality. These public health gains are predicted to increase in coming decades if progress in increasing coverage is sustained.","/content/10.1101/19004358v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004358v1.full.pdf","2019-08-27","Public and Global Health

"Neuroimaging biomarkers differentiate Parkinson disease with and without cognitive impairment and dementia","Mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease places a high burden on patients and is likely a precursor to Parkinson disease-related dementia. Studying the functional connectivity and morphology of subcortical structures within basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits may uncover neuroimaging biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction in PD. We used an atlas-based seed region-of-interest approach to investigate resting-state functional connectivity of important subdivisions of the caudate nucleus, putamen and thalamus, between controls (n = 33), cognitively unimpaired Parkinson disease subjects (n = 33), Parkinson disease subjects with mild cognitive impairment (n = 22) and Parkinson disease subjects with dementia (n = 17). We then investigated how the morphology of the caudate, putamen and thalamus structures and differed between groups. Results indicate that cognitively unimpaired Parkinson disease subjects, compared to controls, display increased functional connectivity of the dorsal caudate, anterior putamen and mediodorsal thalamic subdivisions with areas across the frontal lobe, as well as reduced functional connectivity of the dorsal caudate with posterior cortical and cerebellar regions. Compared to cognitively unimpaired subjects, Parkinson disease subjects with mild cognitive impairment demonstrated reduced functional connectivity of the mediodorsal thalamus with midline nodes within the executive-control network. Compared to subjects with mild cognitive impairment, subjects with dementia demonstrated reduced functional connectivity of the mediodorsal thalamus with the posterior cingulate cortex, a key node within the default-mode network. Extensive volumetric and surface-based deflation was found in Parkinson disease subjects with dementia. Our research demonstrates how functional connectivity of the caudate, putamen and thalamus are implicated in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease, with mild cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease associated with a breakdown in functional connectivity of the mediodorsal thalamus with para- and posterior cingulate regions of the brain.","/content/10.1101/19002147v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002147v2.full.pdf","2019-08-26","Radiology and Imaging

"Medal: a patient similarity metric using medication prescribing patterns","Patient similarity offers an exciting potential to improve our understanding of treatment patterns. Medication history is a valuable source of information given the clinical considerations taken during the physician's prescription process. However, available similarity methods do not consider timeliness of event occurrence in the longitudinal care of patients.

In this observational cohort study, we propose an event alignment algorithm, Medal, which uses a dynamic programming approach for pairwise alignment of medication histories. To test our algorithm, we obtained the medication usage from a cohort of patients with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). After calculating a distance metric with Medal, we compute a hierarchical clustering and explore the most appropriate number of clusters. 

We identified four clusters in PANS with distinct medication usage histories, driven primarily by penicillin. We foresee that our algorithm could be used to identify clusters in other syndromes treated with multiple medication regimens.","/content/10.1101/19004440v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004440v2.full.pdf","2019-08-26",NA,"Lopez Pineda","/highwire/citation/68881/bibtext",453,"211119-453","21/11/2019","68881"
"Personality profiles differ between patients with epileptic seizures and patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures","Aim: The primary aim of the study was to determine whether patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) have different personality profiles compared to patients with epileptic seizures (ES). The secondary aim was to determine whether any such personality differences could be used to efficiently screen for PNES in clinical settings.

Background: PNES and ES are often difficult to differentiate, leading to incorrect or delayed diagnosis. While the current gold-standard investigation is video-EEG monitoring (VEM), it is resource intensive and not universally available. Although some research has investigated the differential psychological profiles of PNES and ES patients, most studies have focused on symptoms of psychopathology. The lack of research using modern personality models in PNES and ES presents a gap in knowledge that this study aimed to address.

Methods: A retrospective collection of data was conducted on patients who completed the NEO-Five Factor Inventory questionnaire during a VEM admission to the Royal Melbourne Hospital between 2002-2017. Patients were classified as either ES or PNES based on clinical consensus diagnosis. For patients with ES, type of epilepsy and laterality of seizure focus were also recorded. Personality differences were investigated using Bayesian linear mixed effects models. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also performed to generate sensitivities and specificities of individual personality scores.

Results: 305 patients were included in the study. The 'openness to experience' domain was the only personality factor demonstrating strong evidence for a group difference (BF10 = 21.55, d = -0.43 [95% CI -0.71, -0.17]), with patients in the PNES group having higher scores compared to the ES group. Within the openness to experience domain, only the 'aesthetic interest' facet showed evidence for a group difference (BF10 = 7.98, d = -0.39 [95% CI -0.66, -0.12]). ES patients had lower scores on these measures compared to the normal population, while PNES patients did not. Both openness to experience and aesthetic interest, however, showed poor sensitivities (53%, 46% respectively) and specificities (69%, 46% respectively) for classifying PNES and ES patients. There were no differences between personality profiles in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) and non-TLE patients, or in laterality in TLE.

Conclusion: Patients with ES exhibit lower openness to experience and aesthetic interest compared to patients with PNES and compared to the general population. Despite these differences, the relatively low sensitivity and specificity of these instruments suggests their use is limited in a clinical setting. Nevertheless, these findings open up new avenues of research using modern personality models to further understand patients with epilepsy and related presentations.","/content/10.1101/19002717v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002717v2.full.pdf","2019-08-26","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Distinct psychopathology profiles in patients with epileptic seizures compared to non-epileptic psychogenic seizures","Objective: Similarities in clinical presentations between epileptic seizures (ES) and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) produces a risk of misdiagnosis. Video-EEG monitoring (VEM) is the diagnostic gold standard, but involves significant cost and time commitment, suggesting a need for efficient screening tools.

Methods: 628 patients were recruited from an inpatient VEM unit; 293 patients with ES, 158 with PNES, 31 both ES and PNES, and 146 non-diagnostic. Patients completed the SCL-90-R, a standardised 90-item psychopathology instrument. Bayesian linear models were computed to investigate whether SCL-90-R domain scores or the overall psychopathology factor p differed between groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were computed to investigate the PNES classification accuracy of each domain score and p. A machine learning algorithm was also used to determine which subset of SCL-90-R items produced the greatest classification accuracy.

Results: Evidence was found for elevated scores in PNES compared to ES groups in the symptom domains of anxiety (b = 0.47, 95%HDI = [0.10, 0.80]), phobic anxiety (b = 1.32, 95%HDI = [0.98, 1.69]), somatisation (b = 0.84, 95%HDI = [0.49, 1.20]), and the general psychopathology factor p (b = 1.35, 95%HDI = [0.86, 1.82]). Of the SCL-90-R domain scores, somatisation produced the highest classification accuracy (AUC = 0.74, 95%CI = [0.69, 0.79]). The genetic algorithm produced a 6-item subset from the SCL-90-R, which produced comparable classification accuracy to the somatisation scores (AUC = 0.73, 95%CI = [0.64, 0.82]).

Significance: Compared to patients with ES, patients with PNES report greater symptoms of somatisation, general anxiety, and phobic anxiety against a background of generally elevated psychopathology. While self-reported psychopathology scores are not accurate enough for diagnosis in isolation, elevated psychopathology in these domains should raise the suspicion of PNES in clinical settings.","/content/10.1101/19003038v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003038v2.full.pdf","2019-08-26","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Genetic risk of obesity as a modifier of associations between neighbourhood environment and body mass index: an observational study of 335,046 UK Biobank participants","Background: There is growing recognition that recent global increases in obesity are the product of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. However, in gene-environment studies of obesity, ""environment"" usually refers to individual behavioural factors that influence energy balance, while more upstream environmental factors are overlooked. We examined gene-environment interactions between genetic risk of obesity and two neighbourhood characteristics likely to be associated with obesity (proximity to takeaway/fast-food outlets and availability of physical activity facilities). 
Methods: We used data from 335,046 adults aged 40-70 in the UK Biobank cohort to conduct a population-based cross-sectional study of interactions between neighbourhood characteristics and genetic risk of obesity, in relation to BMI. Proximity to a fast-food outlet was defined as distance from home address to nearest takeaway/fast-food outlet, and availability of physical activity facilities as the number of formal physical activity facilities within one kilometre of home address. Genetic risk of obesity was operationalised by 91-SNP and 69-SNP weighted genetic risk scores, and by six individual SNPs considered separately. Multivariable, mixed effects models with product terms for the gene-environment interactions were estimated. 
Results: After accounting for likely confounding, the association between proximity to takeaway/fast-food outlets and BMI was stronger among those at increased genetic risk of obesity, with evidence of an interaction with polygenic risk scores (P=0.018 and P=0.028 for 69-SNP and 91-SNP scores, respectively) and in particular with a SNP linked to MC4R (P=0.009), a gene known to regulate food intake. We found very little evidence of a gene-environment interaction for availability of physical activity facilities.  
Conclusions: Individuals at an increased genetic risk of obesity may be more sensitive to exposure to the local fast-food environment.  Ensuring that neighbourhood residential environments are designed to promote a healthy weight may be particularly important for those with greater genetic susceptibility to obesity","/content/10.1101/19004671v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004671v2.full.pdf","2019-08-26","Epidemiology

"Increased functional connectivity of thalamic subdivisions in patients with Parkinson's disease","Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 2-3% of the population over the age of 65 with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra impacting the functioning of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. The precise role played by the thalamus is unknown, despite its critical role in the functioning of the cerebral cortex, and the abnormal neuronal activity of the structure in PD. Our objective was to more clearly elucidate how functional connectivity and morphology of the thalamus are impacted in PD (n = 32) compared to Controls (n = 20). To investigate functional connectivity of the thalamus we subdivided the structure into two important regions-of-interest, the first with putative connections to the motor cortices and the second with putative connections to prefrontal cortices. We then investigated potential differences in the size and shape of the thalamus in PD, and how morphology and functional connectivity relate to clinical variables. Our data demonstrate that PD is associated with increases in functional connectivity between motor subdivisions of the thalamus and the supplementary motor area, and between prefrontal thalamic subdivisions and nuclei of the basal ganglia, anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, as well as the anterior and paracingulate gyri. These results suggest that PD is associated with increased functional connectivity of subdivisions of the thalamus which may be indicative alterations to basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry.","/content/10.1101/19002139v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002139v2.full.pdf","2019-08-26","Radiology and Imaging

"Rationalising neurosurgical head injury referrals: The development and implementation of the Liverpool Head Injury Tomography Score (Liverpool HITS) for mild traumatic brain injury","Objectives
To develop and implement a radiological scoring system to define a surgically significant mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), stratify neurosurgical referrals and improve communication between referral centres and neurosurgical units.
Design
Retrospective single centre case-control analysis of ten continuous months of mild TBI referrals.
Setting
A major tertiary neurosurgery centre in England, UK.
Participants
All neurosurgical referrals with a mild TBI (GCS 13-15) during the period of 1st January to 30th October 2017 were eligible for the study. 1248 patients were identified during the study period, with 1144 being included in the final analysis.
Interventions
All patients CT head results from the referring centres were scored retrospectively using the scoring system and stratified according to their mean score, and if they were accepted for transfer to the neurosurgical centre or managed locally.
Main outcome measure
Determine the discriminatory and diagnostic power, sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system for predicting a surgically significant mild TBI.
Results
Most patients referred were male (59.4%, N=681), with a mean age of 69 years (SD=21.1). Of the referrals to the neurosurgical centre, 17% (n=195) were accepted for transfer and 83% (n=946) were not accepted. The scoring system was 99% sensitive and 51.9% specific for determining a surgically significant TBI. Diagnostic power of the model was fair with an area under the curve of 0.79 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.82). The score identified 495 (52.2%) patients in ten months of referrals that could have been successfully managed locally without neurosurgical referral if the scoring system was correctly used at the time of injury.
Conclusion
The Liverpool Head Injury Tomography Score (HITS) score is a CT based scoring system that can be used to define a surgically significant mild TBI. The scoring system can be easily used by multiple healthcare professionals, has high sensitivity, will reduce neurosurgical referrals, and could be incorporated into local, regional and national head injury guidance.","/content/10.1101/19004499v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004499v2.full.pdf","2019-08-26","Surgery

"Epigenome-wide association study of seizures in childhood and adolescence","The occurrence of seizures in childhood is often associated with neurodevelopmental impairments and school underachievement. Common genetic variants associated with epilepsy have been identified and epigenetic mechanisms have also been suggested to play a role. In this study we analysed the association of genome-wide blood DNA methylation with the occurrence of seizures in ~800 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, UK, at birth (cord blood), during childhood and adolescence (peripheral blood). We also analysed the association between the lifetime occurrence of any seizures before age 13 with blood DNA methylation levels. We sought replication of the findings in the Generation R Study and explored causality using Mendelian randomization, i.e. using genetic variants as proxies. The results showed five CpG sites which were associated cross-sectionally with seizures either in childhood or adolescence (1-5% absolute methylation difference at pFDR<0.05), although the evidence of replication in an independent study was weak. One of these sites was located in the BDNF gene, which is highly expressed in the brain, and showed high correspondence with brain methylation levels. The Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that seizures might be causal for changes in methylation rather than vice-versa. In addition, seizure-associated methylation changes could affect other outcomes such as growth, cognitive skills and educational attainment. In conclusion, we present a link between seizures and DNA methylation which suggests that DNA methylation changes might mediate some of the effects of seizures on growth and neurodevelopment.","/content/10.1101/19005116v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005116v1.full.pdf","2019-08-26","Epidemiology

"Enhancing multi-center generalization of machine learning-based depression diagnosis from resting-state fMRI","Resting-state fMRI has the potential to find abnormal behavior in brain activity and to diagnose patients with depression. However, resting-state fMRI has a bias depending on the scanner site, which makes it difficult to diagnose depression at a new site. In this paper, we propose methods to improve the performance of the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) at an independent site by reducing the site bias effects using regression. For this, we used a subgroup of healthy subjects of the independent site to regress out site bias. We further improved the classification performance of patients with depression by focusing on melancholic depressive disorder. Our proposed methods would be useful to apply depression classifiers to subjects at completely new sites.","/content/10.1101/19004051v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004051v1.full.pdf","2019-08-25","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Characterizing traumatic brain injury and its association with homelessness in a community-based sample of precariously housed adults and youth","We characterized the prevalence, mechanisms, and sex difference of lifetime traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a precariously housed sample. We also examined the impact of TBI severity and timing on becoming and staying homeless. 285 precariously housed participants (adults n = 226, youths n = 59) completed the Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire (BISQ) in addition to other health assessments. A history of TBI was reported in 82.1% of the sample, with 64.6% reporting > 1 TBI, and 21.4% reporting a moderate or severe TBI (msTBI). 10.1% of adults had traumatically-induced lesions on MRI scans. Assault was the most common mechanism of injury overall, and females reported significantly more TBIs due to physical abuse than males (adjusted OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.14 - 1.39, p = 9.18e-6). The first msTBI was significantly closer to the first experience of homelessness (b = 2.79, p = 0.003) and precarious housing (b = 2.69, p = 7.47e-4) than was the first mild TBI. Traumatic brain injuries more proximal to the initial loss of stable housing were associated with a longer lifetime duration of homelessness (RR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.02 - 1.06, p = 6.8e-6) and precarious housing (RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01 - 1.04, p = 5.5e-10). These findings demonstrate the high prevalence of TBI in vulnerable persons and the severity- and timing-related risk that TBI may confer for the onset and prolongation of homelessness.","/content/10.1101/19004606v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004606v1.full.pdf","2019-08-23","Public and Global Health

"Impairment of dual-task gait dynamics in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: Relationships to neuropsychological status, fitness and brain morphology","Background:
Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) have more gait variability under dual-task conditions than cognitively healthy adults. However, characteristics associated with this susceptibility of gait to dual-task stress are unknown. 

Methods: 
Testing was performed at baseline in the Study of Mental And Resistance Training (SMART). Ninety-three adults with MCI (age 70Â±6.8 years; 66.6% female) performed a single- and dual-task walk (cognitive distractor=letter fluency), in random order. Linear and non-linear gait variability were measured using force-sensitive insoles. Cognitive performance during dual-tasking was assessed by the number of correct words vocalized. Cognitive function, brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), muscle strength, aerobic capacity, body composition, physical and psychosocial function were also assessed as potential correlates of gait dynamics. 

Results: 
Gait dynamics worsened during dual-tasking, with decrements in both stride time variability (p<0.001) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) (p=0.001). Lower aerobic capacity and thinner posterior cingulate cortex were associated with greater decrements in DFA (p<0.05). Smaller hippocampal volume, worse psychological well-being and poorer static balance were associated with greater decrements in stride time variability (p<0.05).  By contrast, cognitive performance did not change under dual-task conditions compared to seated testing (p=0.13). 

Conclusions:
Under dual-task conditions, participants with MCI preserved their cognitive performance at the expense of gait stability.  Decrements in dual-tasking gait were associated with lower aerobic fitness, balance, psychological well-being, and brain volume in cognitively-relevant areas of the posterior cingulate and hippocampus, all potentially modifiable characteristics. Trials of targeted interventions are needed to determine the potential plasticity of gait variability in high-risk cohorts.","/content/10.1101/19005249v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005249v1.full.pdf","2019-08-23","Geriatric Medicine

"Relationship between early childhood non-parental childcare and diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep: A systematic review of longitudinal studies","Background: The rising prevalence of childhood obesity is a global public health concern. Evidence suggests that exposure to non-parental childcare before age six years is associated with increased risk of obesity, diet, and activity behaviours (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep). However, findings are inconsistent and mostly from cross-sectional studies, making it difficult to identify the direction of causation in associations. This review identified and synthesised the published research on longitudinal associations between non-parental childcare during early childhood, diet, and activity behaviours. 

Methods: Seven databases were searched using a predefined search strategy. Results were independently double-screened through title/abstract and full-text stages according to predefined criteria. Included studies were tabulated, and evaluated for risk of bias using the Nutrition Evidence Library Bias Assessment Tool. 

Results: Of 18793 references screened, 13 studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Eight studies reported on diet and seven studies reported on activity behaviour outcomes (three on physical activity, three on sedentary behaviour, and one on sleep). These studies included results on 89 tested childcare:outcome associations. Of 63 associations testing diet outcomes, 37 (59%) were null, and the remainder showed inconsistent patterns. There was an indication of a potential benefit of Head Start providers (vs other care, including parental) on dietary behaviours. Of 26 associations testing activity behaviour outcomes, 22 (85%) were null, and the remainder were inconsistent. Most studies (92%) did not use (or did not report using) valid and reliable outcome measures, and outcome assessors were not blinded (or it was unclear if they were blinded) to children's exposure status (77%). 

Conclusions: The scarce available literature indicates little and mixed evidence of a longitudinal association between exposure to non-parental childcare before age six years and diet or activity behaviours. This reflects a paucity of research, rather than clear evidence of no effect. There is an urgent need for studies investigating the longitudinal associations of non-parental childcare on diet and activity behaviours to assess potential lasting effects and mechanisms. Studies should assess whether and how associations vary by provider and child sub-groups, as well as differences by intensity and duration of care.","/content/10.1101/19005413v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005413v1.full.pdf","2019-08-23",NA,"Costa","/highwire/citation/68846/bibtext",463,"211119-463","21/11/2019","68846"
"Why Westerners Are Dissatisfied: A Cross-Sectional Study Identifying State-Level Factors Associated with Variation in Private Health Insurance Satisfaction","Large regional variations in consumer satisfaction with private health insurance plans have been observed, but the factors driving this variation are unknown. We conducted a cross-sectional study examining regional and state variations in consumer health insurance plan satisfaction using National Committee for Quality Assurance data from 2015 to 2018, state-level health data and parent insurance family. Our goal was to identify explanatory state-level and insurance family-level predictors of satisfaction with private health insurance. Overall, 2176 private health insurance plans were included in this study. Consumer satisfaction with health insurance was consistently lowest in the West (p<0.0001). Lower private health insurance plan satisfaction was associated with the percentage of the population without a place of usual medical care, the percentage of the state population that is Hispanic, and the percentage of the population reporting any mental illness. Factors associated with increasing insurance satisfaction included higher healthcare spending per capita, a higher number of for-profit beds per capita, and an increased cancer death rate. Increased consumer satisfaction was associated with the Kaiser and Anthem insurance plan families.
We reliably identified state and insurer-level factors that are predictive of private health insurance plan satisfaction. Potentially modifiable factors include access to primary care, healthcare spending per capita, and numbers of for-profit hospital beds. This information will help consumers hold insurance providers accountable to provide higher quality and more desirable coverage and provide actionable items to improve health insurance satisfaction.","/content/10.1101/19004762v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004762v2.full.pdf","2019-08-22","Health Policy

"Accuracy of Medical Billing Data Against the Electronic Health Record in the Measurement of Colorectal Cancer Screening Rates","Objective: Administrative healthcare data are an attractive source of secondary analysis because of their potential to answer population-health questions. Although these datasets have known susceptibilities to biases, the degree to which they can distort measurements like cancer screening rates are not widely appreciated, nor are their causes and possible solutions. 
Methods: Using a billing code database derived from our institution's electronic health records (EHR), we estimated the colorectal cancer screening rate of average-risk patients aged 50-74 seen in primary care or gastroenterology clinic in 2016-2017. 200 records (150 unscreened, 50 screened) were sampled to quantify the accuracy against manual review. 
Results: Out of 4,611 patients, an analysis of billing data suggested a 61% screening rate.  Manual review revealed a positive predictive value of 96% (86-100%), negative predictive value of 21% (15-29%), and a corrected screening rate of 85% (81-90%). Most false negatives occurred due to exams performed outside the scope of the database - both within and outside of our institution - but 21% of false negatives fell within the database's scope. False positives occurred due to incomplete exams and inadequate bowel preparation. Reasons for screening failure include ordered but incomplete exams (48%), lack of or incorrect documentation by primary care (29%) including incorrect screening intervals (13%), and patients declining screening (13%).
Conclusions: Although analytics on administrative data are commonly 'validated' by comparison to independent datasets, comparing our naive estimate to the CDC estimate (~60%) would have been misleading. Therefore, regular data audits using the complete EHR are critical to improve screening rates and measure improvement.","/content/10.1101/19004598v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004598v2.full.pdf","2019-08-22","Health Informatics

"Mediterranean Diet improves thrombosis biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk individuals: a randomized controlled trial","Following a Traditional Mediterranean diet (TMD) decreases cardiovascular risk. However, its anti-thrombotic effects are unexplored. We aimed to assess whether this dietary pattern improved thrombosis-related biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk subjects. In 358 random PREDIMED Study volunteers (Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea), we assessed: 1) 1-year effects of a TMD, enriched in virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO; N=120) or nuts (TMD-Nuts; N=119) versus a low-fat diet (N=119), on thrombosis biomarkers; 2) the differences between individuals with greater TMD compliance increments (=3 adherence score points) and those with compliance decrements; and 3) associations between 1-year changes in key TMD food groups and thrombosis signals. TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts attenuated pro-thrombotic status (-5.1% -P=0.045- and -5.8% -P=0.025-, respectively). TMD-VOO decreased HDL-bound a1-antitrypsin levels (HDL pro-inflammatory/pro-thrombotic properties, -6.3%, P=0.034) and increased HDL platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase activity (+7.5%, P=0.044). TMD-Nuts diminished non-esterified fatty acid levels (-10.3%, P=0.022). Individuals with greater TMD adherence increments presented decreases in their pro-thrombotic status (-9.5%, P=0.032), fibrinogen levels (-9.1%, P=0.030), and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations (-18.1%, P=0.011). Only the low-fat diet was associated with increased platelet factor-4 concentrations (P=0.012) and thrombin activation (higher prothrombin factor1+2 levels, P=0.003) versus baseline. Finally, in the secondary analyses, nut intake increases were associated with antithrombin increments, fruit and vegetable consumption increases were linked to decreases of thrombin activation, and processed meat intake decrements were related to increases in antithrombin and nitrite + nitrate levels (P<0.05). Summarizing, TMD and some of its typical food items were associated with improved thrombosis biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk individuals.","/content/10.1101/19001909v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001909v2.full.pdf","2019-08-22","Nutrition

"Toward Automated Classification of Pathological Transcranial Doppler Waveform Morphology via Spectral Clustering","Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity waveforms acquired via Transcranial Doppler (TCD) can provide evidence for cerebrovascular occlusion and stenosis. Thrombolysis in Brain Ischemia (TIBI) flow grades are widely used for this purpose, but require subjective assessment by expert evaluators to be reliable. In this work we seek to determine whether TCD morphology can be objectively assessed using an unsupervised machine learning approach to waveform categorization. TCD beat waveforms were recorded at multiple depths from the Middle Cerebral Arteries of 106 subjects; 33 with CTA-confirmed Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO). From each waveform, three morphological variables were extracted, quantifying absolute peak onset, number/prominence of auxiliary peaks, and systolic canopy length. Spectral clustering identified groups implicit in the resultant three-dimensional feature space, with gap-statistic criteria establishing the optimal cluster number. We found that gap-statistic disparity was maximized at four clusters, referred to as flow types I, II, III, and IV. Types I and II were primarily composed of control subject waveforms, whereas types III and IV derived mainly from LVO patients. Cluster morphologies for types I and IV aligned clearly with Normal and Blunted TIBI flows, respectively. Types II and III represented commonly observed flow-types not delineated by TIBI, which nonetheless deviate quantifiably from normal and blunted flows. We conclude that important morphological variability exists beyond that currently quantified by TIBI in populations experiencing or at-risk for acute ischemic stroke, and posit that the observed flow-types provide the foundation for objective methods of real-time automated flow type classification.","/content/10.1101/19003236v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003236v2.full.pdf","2019-08-22","Neurology

"Leveraging multiple data types to estimate the true size of the Zika epidemic in the Americas","Since the first Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was confirmed in Brazil in May 2015, several hundred thousand cases have been reported across the Americas. This figure gives an incomplete picture of the epidemic, however, given that asymptomatic infections, imperfect surveillance, and variability in reporting rates imply that the incidence of infection was likely much higher. The infection attack rate (IAR)--defined as the proportion of the population that was infected over the course of the epidemic--has important implications for the longer-term epidemiology of Zika in the region, such as the timing, location, and likelihood of future outbreaks. To estimate the IAR and the total number of people infected, we leveraged multiple types of Zika case data from 15 countries and territories where subnational data were publicly available. Datasets included confirmed and suspected Zika cases in pregnant women and in the total population, Zika-associated Guillan-BarrÃ© syndrome cases, and cases of congenital Zika syndrome. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model with empirically-informed priors that leveraged the different case report types to simultaneously estimate national and subnational reporting rates, the fraction of symptomatic infections, and subnational IARs. In these 15 countries and territories, estimates of Zika IAR ranged from 0.084 (95% CrI: 0.067-0.096) in Peru to 0.361 (95% CrI: 0.214-0.514) in Ecuador, with significant subnational variability in IAR for every country. Totaling these infection estimates across these and 33 other countries and territories in the region, our results suggest that 132.3 million (95% CrI: 111.3-170.2 million) people in the Americas have been infected by ZIKV since 2015. These estimates represent the most extensive attempt to date to determine the size of the Zika epidemic in the Americas, and they offer an important baseline for assessing the risk of future Zika epidemics in this region.","/content/10.1101/19002865v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002865v2.full.pdf","2019-08-22","Epidemiology

"Multidrug therapy with terbinafine plus daily fluconazole is more effective than terbinafine alone or terbinafine plus weekly fluconazole in current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India: Results of a randomized pragmatic trial","Background: Treatment responsiveness of tinea has decreased considerably in recent past in India. We tested effectiveness of oral terbinafine daily plus fluconazole weekly (TFw) and terbinafine daily plus fluconazole daily (TFd) versus oral terbinafine daily (T) in tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei in a pragmatic randomized open trial.
Methods: One hundred and seventeen microscopy confirmed patients were allocated to T (6 mg/kg/day), TFw (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day+fluconazole 12 mg/kg once weekly), or TFd (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day+fluconazole 6 mg/kg/day) groups by concealed randomization and treated for 8 weeks or cure. Each group included 39 patients.
Results: At 4 weeks, 9 (23.1%), 8 (20.5%) and 14 (35.9%) patients were cured in T, TFw and TFd groups, respectively (P=0.279). At 8 weeks, number of patients cured was as follows: T 13 (33.3%), TFw 18 (46.2%) and TFd 25 (64.1%). TFd was more effective than T (P=0.012), other comparisons were not significantly different. However, effect size as calculated by number needed to treat (NNT) (versus terbinafine) was 8 for TFw and 4 for TFd. Relapse rates one month after cure were similar in all groups (P=0.664). 
Conclusions: In view of cure rates and NNT, terbinafine plus daily fluconazole is more effective than terbinafine alone or terbinafine plus weekly fluconazole in current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India.","/content/10.1101/19005025v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005025v1.full.pdf","2019-08-22","Dermatology

"Poor glycemic control and associated factors among diabetic patients in Ethiopia; A Systemic review and meta-analysis","Abstract
Introduction 
The major global public health problems now days are diabetes especially the burden is high in low income countries including Ethiopia due to the limited resource for screening and early diagnosis of the diabetes. To prevent diabetic complications including organ damage and micro vascular complications blood glucose level should be maintained at an optimum level. However there was no pooled national picture on poor glycemic control and its associated factors. 
Methods 
Different data base searching engine including PubMed, Google scholar, the Cochrane library, MEDLINE,, HINARY and African journal online (AJOL) were used.  The Joanna Briggs Critical Appraisal Tools and Newcastle Ottawa scale for assessing the quality of cross sectional studies were used for quality assessment.  The meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 14 software. I2   statistic and egger weighted regression were used to assess heterogeneity and publication bias. 
Results 	
A total of 134 studies were identified from different database searching engines and other sources. After removing for duplication, absence of abstract and review of the full text 12 studies were including in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients in Ethiopia is 64.72% with 95% confidence interval 63.16-66.28%. The sub group analysis of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients in different region of the country shows consistent and high prevalence of poor glycemic control ranging from 62.5% in Tigray region to 65.6% in Oromia region of the country.  Residence, dyslipidemia and diet adherence were significantly association with poor glycemic control among diabetic patients in Ethiopia.
Conclusion 
The prevalence of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients was high in Ethiopia and consistent across different regions of the country.  The most important factors associated with poor glycemic factor among diabetic patients were being rural residence, having dyslipidemia and not adhering to dietary plan.

"Social Media Surveillance for Perceived Therapeutic Effects of Cannabidiol (CBD) Products","Background: CBD products have risen in popularity given its therapeutic potential and lack of legal oversight, despite lacking conclusive scientific evidence for wide spread over-the-counter usage for many of its perceived benefits. While medical evidence is being generated, social media surveillance offers a fast and inexpensive alternative to traditional surveys in ascertaining perceived therapeutic purposes and modes of consumption for CBD products.
Methods: We collected all comments from the CBD subreddit posted between January 1 and April 30, 2019 as well as comments submitted to the FDA regarding regulation of cannabis-derived products and analyzed them using a rule-based language processing method. A relative ranking of popular therapeutic uses and product groups for CBD is obtained based on frequency of pattern matches including precise queries that entail identifying mentions of the condition, a CBD product, and some trigger phrase indicating therapeutic use. 
Results: CBD is mostly discussed as a remedy for anxiety disorders and pain and this is consistent across both comment sources. Of comments posted to the CBD subreddit during the monitored time span, 6.19% mentioned anxiety at least once with at least 6.02% of these comments specifically mentioning CBD as a treatment for anxiety. The most popular CBD product group is oil and tinctures.
Conclusion: Social media surveillance of CBD usage has the potential to surface new therapeutic use-cases as they are posted. As FDA ponders regulation, our effort demonstrates that social data offers a convenient affordance to surveil for CBD usage patterns in a way that is fast and inexpensive.","/content/10.1101/19004929v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004929v1.full.pdf","2019-08-22","Health Informatics

"Candidate molecular predictors of outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage: a systematic review of haemoglobin metabolism, inflammation and oxidative injury pathways.","Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) is a devastating form of stroke associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Very little is known about the predictors of poor outcome and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurological injury following aSAH. Three molecular pathways have been shown to be important: haemoglobin metabolism, inflammation and oxidative injury. The aim of this review is to use a systematic approach to identify a panel of key genes within these three pathways in order to focus future studies investigating predictors of poor outcome and the mechanisms of neurological injury following aSAH. Manual searching and bioinformatic mining tools were used. Studies of experimental or human SAH were included, and outcome was broadly defined to include all encountered readouts such as mortality, neurological scores, and neuropathological markers of tissue damage. If two or more molecules belonged to the same biochemical pathway, this pathway was examined in detail to identify all its components, which were then searched individually for any evidence of association with outcome using the same broad definition as before. This resulted in the identification of 58 candidate genes within the three pathways of interest (haemoglobin metabolism, inflammation and oxidative injury) potentially linked to outcome after aSAH.","/content/10.1101/19004853v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004853v1.full.pdf","2019-08-22","Neurology

"Dynamic Changes in Prescription Opioids from 2006 to 2017 in Texas","Study Objective: The US is experiencing an epidemic of opioid overdoses which may be at least partially due to an over-reliance on opioid analgesics in the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain and subsequent escalation to heroin or illicit fentanyl. As Texas was reported to be among the lowest in the US for opioid use and misuse, further examination of this state is warranted. 

Study Design: This study was conducted to quantify prescription opioid use in Texas. 

Data Source: Data was obtained from the publically available US Drug Enforcement Administration Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) which monitors controlled substances transactions from manufacture to commercial distribution. 

Results: Data for 2006 to 2017 from Texas for ten prescription opioids including eight primarily used to relieve pain (codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone) and two (buprenorphine and methadone) for the treatment of an Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) were examined. The change in Morphine Mg Equivalent (MME) of all opioids (+23.3%) was only slightly greater than the states population gains (21.1%). Opioids used to treat an OUD showed pronounced gains (+90.8%) which were four-fold faster than population growth. Analysis of individual agents revealed pronounced elevations in codeine (+387.5%), hydromorphone (+106.7%), and oxycodone (+43.6%) and a reduction in meperidine (-80.3%) in 2017 relative to 2006. Methadone in 2017 accounted for a greater portion (39.5%) of the total MME than hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and meperidine, combined. There were differences between urban and rural areas in the changes in hydrocodone and buprenorphine.

Conclusions: Collectively, these findings indicate that continued vigilance is needed in Texas to appropriately treat pain and an OUD while minimizing the potential for prescription opioid diversion and misuse. Texas may lead the US in a return to pre opioid crisis prescription levels.","/content/10.1101/19004879v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004879v1.full.pdf","2019-08-22","Pharmacology and Therapeutics

"Health literacy, cognitive ability and self-reported diabetes in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing","Objective: To examine the association of health literacy and cognitive ability with risk of diabetes.
Research Design and Methods: Participants were 8,669 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing participants (mean age 66.7 years, SD 9.7) who completed health literacy and cognitive ability tests at wave 2 (2004-2005), and who answered a self-reported question on whether a doctor had ever diagnosed them with diabetes. Logistic regression was used to examine the cross-sectional associations of health literacy and cognitive ability with diabetes status. In those without diabetes at wave 2, Cox regression was used to test the associations of health literacy and cognitive ability with risk of diabetes over a median of 9.5 years follow-up (n=6,961). 
Results: Adequate (compared to limited) health literacy (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.84) and higher cognitive ability (OR per 1 SD 0.73, CI 0.67-0.80) were both associated with lower odds of self-reported diabetes. Adequate health literacy (HR 0.64; CI 0.53-0.77) and higher cognitive ability (HR 0.77, CI 0.69-0.85) were also associated with lower risk of self-reporting diabetes during follow-up. When both health literacy and cognitive ability were added to the same model, these associations were slightly attenuated. Additional adjustment for health behaviours, education and social class attenuated associations further, and neither health literacy nor cognitive ability were significantly associated with diabetes. 
Conclusions: Adequate health literacy and better cognitive ability were associated with reduced risk of diabetes. These associations were independent of each other, but not of other health- and socioeconomic-related variables.","/content/10.1101/19003756v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003756v1.full.pdf","2019-08-22","Epidemiology

"Photo-Integrated Conversation Moderated by Robots for Cognitive Health in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Background and Objectives: Social interaction might prevent or delay dementia, but little is known about the specific effects of various social activity interventions on cognition. This study conducted a single-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Photo-Integrated Conversation moderated by a Robot (PICMOR), a group conversation intervention program for resilience against cognitive decline and dementia.
Research Design and Methods: In the RCT, PICMOR was compared to an unstructured group conversation condition. Sixty-five community-living older adults participated in this study. The intervention was provided once a week for 12 weeks. Primary outcome measures were the cognitive functions; process outcome measures included the linguistic characteristics of speech to estimate interaction quality. Baseline and post-intervention data were collected. PICMOR contains two key features: (i) photos taken by the participants are displayed and discussed sequentially; and (ii) a robotic moderator manages turn-taking to make sure that participants are allocated the same amount of time.
Results: Among the primary outcome measures (i.e., cognitive functions), verbal fluency significantly improved in the intervention group. Among the process outcome measures (i.e., linguistic characteristics of speech), the amount of speech and richness of words were larger for the intervention group.
Discussion and Implications: This study demonstrated for the first time the positive effects of a robotic social activity intervention on cognitive function in healthy older adults via RCT. The group conversation generated by PICMOR may improve participants cognitive function controlling the amount of speech produced to make it equal. PICMOR is available and accessible to community-living older adults.","/content/10.1101/19004796v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004796v1.full.pdf","2019-08-21","Geriatric Medicine

"Research on Artificial Intelligence and Primary Care: A Scoping Review","Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the nature and extent of the body of research on artificial intelligence (AI) and primary care.

Methods: We performed a scoping review, searching 11 published and grey literature databases with subject headings and key words pertaining to the concepts of 1) AI and 2) primary care: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, MathSciNet, AAAI, arXiv. Screening included title and abstract and then full text stages. Final inclusion criteria: 1) research study of any design, 2) developed or used AI, 3) used primary care data and/or study conducted in a primary care setting and/or explicit mention of study applicability to primary care; exclusion criteria: 1) narrative, editorial, or textbook chapter, 2) not applicable to primary care population or settings, 3) full text inaccessible in the English Language. We extracted and summarized seven key characteristics of included studies: overall study purpose(s), author appointments, primary care functions, author intended target end user(s), target health condition(s), location of data source(s) (if any), subfield(s) of AI.

Results: Of 5,515 non-duplicate documents, 405 met our eligibility criteria. The body of literature is primarily focused on creating novel AI methods or modifying existing AI methods to support physician diagnostic or treatment recommendations, for chronic conditions, using data from higher income countries. Meaningfully more studies had at least one author with a technology, engineering, or math appointment than with a primary care appointment (57 (14%) compared to 217 (54%)). Predominant AI subfields were supervised machine learning and expert systems. 

Discussion: Overall, AI research associated with primary care is at an early stage of maturity with respect to widespread implementation in practice settings. For the field to progress, more interdisciplinary research teams with end-user engagement and evaluation studies are needed.","/content/10.1101/19003913v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003913v1.full.pdf","2019-08-21","Primary Care Research

"Harmonizing Palliative Care: National Survey to Evaluate the Knowledge and Attitude of Emergency Physicians towards Palliative Care","Background and Aim: Although the challenges of integrating palliative care practices across care settings are real and well recognised until now little is known about palliative care practice of emergency physicians (EPs) and their accessibility to palliative care services in Kuwait. So the aim of this study was to explore the attitude, and knowledge encountered by EPs in providing palliative care in all general hospitals in Kuwait.
Method: A cross-sectional survey was performed in the emergency rooms of all general hospitals in Kuwait using Palliative Care Attitude and Knowledge (PCAK) questionnaire. 
Results: Of the total number of physicians working in emergency rooms (n=156), 104 (66.67%) had completed the survey. 76.9% (n=80) of the EPs had either uncertain attitude toward palliative care. Most of the EPs (n=73, 70.28%) did not discuss the need of the patients to palliative care either with the patients or their families. Only 16 (15.4%) of the EPs responded correctly to the most of the questions while nearly half of the EPs (n=51, 49%) had poor knowledge especially in the most effective management of refractory dysnea (n=18, 17.3%). Experience more than 11yrs and better knowledge scores were independent predictors of positive attitude after adjustment of age, sex, qualifications, speciality, position, and nationality [OR: 5.747 (CI: 1.031-25.00), 1.458(CI: 1.148-1.851); p-value: 0.021, 0.002 respectively]. 
Conclusions: Despite recognising palliative care as an important competence, the majority of the emergency physicians in Kuwait had uncertain attitude and poor knowledge towards palliative care. Lack of knowledge, direct accessibility to palliative care services and lack of support from palliative medicine specialists were the main reasons for uncertain and negative attitude. Efforts should be done to enhance physician training and provide palliative care resources in order to improve the quality of care given to patients visiting emergency departments.","/content/10.1101/19003939v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003939v1.full.pdf","2019-08-20","Palliative Medicine

"The HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders in Zambia (HANDZ) Study: Protocol of a research program in pediatric HIV in sub-Saharan Africa","Approximately 10% of youth in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. In Zambia, it is estimated that over 72,000 children have HIV infection, and despite access to combination antiretroviral therapy, many will experience HIV-associated neurocognitive deficits (HAND) encompassing cognitive and psychiatric sequelae such as global intellectual delay, executive dysfunction, and depressed mood. However, little is known about the neurocognitive profile of such children, the long-term outcomes and impacts of HAND, or the predictors and risk factors for HAND-related impairment. We have initiated the first-ever prospective, longitudinal study of neurocognition in children with HIV-infection in Zambia. Our overarching study goals are to validate cognitive and psychiatric testing tools in children with HIV infection in Zambia, and to determine if inflammatory biomarkers and brain imaging can prospectively identify children at high risk of developing HAND.

"An Analysis for Key Indicators of Reproducibility in Radiology","Abstract:
Background: Given the central role of radiology in patient care, it is important that radiological research is grounded in reproducible science. It remains unexamined whether there is a lack of reproducibility or transparency in radiologic research. 
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze published radiology literature for the presence or absence of key indicators of reproducibility. 
Methods: This cross-sectional, retrospective study was performed by conducting a search of the National Library of Medicine to identify publications contained within journals in the field of Radiology. Journals that were not written in English or MEDLINE indexed were excluded from the analysis. Studies published from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018 were used to generate a random list of 300 publications for this meta-analysis. A pilot-tested, Google form was used to evaluate key indicators of reproducibility in the queried publications.
Results: Our initial search returned 295,543 records, from which 300 were randomly selected for analysis. Of these 300 records, 294 met the inclusion criteria. Among the empirical publications, 5.6% contained a data availability statement (11/195, 95% CI: 3.0-8.3), 0.51% provided clearly documented raw data (1/195), 12.0% provided a materials availability statement (23/191, 8.4-15.7), none provided analysis scripts, 4.1% provided a preregistration statement (8/195, 1.9-6.3), 2.1% provided a protocol statement (4/195, 0.4-3.7), and 3.6% were preregistered (7/195, 1.5-5.7).
Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that key indicators of reproducibility are missing in the field of radiology. Thus, the ability to reproduce radiological studies may be problematic and may have potential clinical implications.","/content/10.1101/19005074v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005074v1.full.pdf","2019-08-20","Radiology and Imaging

"Prevalence and clinical importance of titin truncating variants in adults without known congestive heart failure","Background: Cross-sectional studies of various forms of dilated cardiomyopathy have noted a truncating mutation in the gene encoding titin ('TTNtv') in 7-30% of patients, but the clinical importance of identifying a TTNtv in an asymptomatic adult is largely unknown. In contrast to cross-sectional studies, prospective cohort studies allow for unbiased estimates of the disease risks associated with a genotype exposure.
 
Objectives: To determine the prevalence of cardiac imaging abnormalities and risk of incident disease among middle-aged TTNtv carriers without known congestive heart failure.
 
Methods: We analyze exome sequencing data of 45,747 participants of the UK Biobank without known congestive heart failure to identify TTNtv carriers. Among 10,552 with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we determine the relationship between TTNtv carrier status and left ventricular ejection fraction. In this prospective cohort, we quantify the absolute and relative risks of incident disease in TTNtv carriers versus noncarriers.
 
Results: Among 45,747 middle-aged participants without known congestive heart failure, 196 (0.43%) harbored a TTNtv. The average ejection fraction was 61% in TTNtv carriers versus 65% in noncarriers (P = 1.8 <U+2A09> 10-8), with a 9.3-fold increase (95% CI 3.9 - 22.2) in odds of subnormal ejection fraction (P = 5.7 <U+2A09> 10-5). Over a median follow-up of 6.9 years, a composite endpoint of incident dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, or all-cause mortality was observed in 6.6% of TTNtv carriers versus 2.9% of non-carriers (adjusted hazard ratio 2.5; 95% CI 1.4 - 4.3; p = 1.1 <U+2A09> 10-3).
 
Conclusions: Approximately 1 in 230 middle-aged adults without known congestive heart failure harbored a TTNtv. These carriers had a substantially increased relative risk-but modest absolute risk-of having a subnormal ejection fraction or manifesting clinical disease during prospective follow-up.","/content/10.1101/19005058v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005058v1.full.pdf","2019-08-20","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Triage-based care of people with Back Pain: STarT Back or Start diagnosing? An observational study.","Objectives
Back pain is a massive public health problem. The STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST) was developed for use in primary care to triage people with lumbar pain, classifying them as low, medium or high risk of prolonged symptoms. This classification guides non-surgical interventions including manual treatments, exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy. Claims suggest SBST brings generic health and cost benefits. National guidance recommends STarT Back is used at the first primary care consultation but can be used at any stage.  For SBST to be an effective triage tool it should distinguish structural from non-structural pain. We tested this requirement in consecutive people referred to a single triage practitioner, hypothesising it was not possible conceptually.
Design
An observational study of the relationship between routine, prospectively collected triage data and diagnosis.
Setting
A secondary care spinal triage service based in a teaching hospital.
Participants
We studied consecutive referrals with lumbar pain triaged by a single extended scope practitioner (ESP) over 22 months (Nov 2015-Sept 2017).
Main Outcome Measures
SBST and pain visual analogue scores (VAS: 0-10) were collected at the initial consultation. We compared data for people with and without surgically remedial lesions.
Results
1041 people were seen (61% female, mean age 53), n=234 (28%) had surgically amenable explanations for pain. People with surgical lesions were older (58 v 51yrs), more likely male (48 v 35%) and had higher VAS scores (6.8 v 6.1). Surgery and non-surgery subgroups had similar SBST total and domain score distribution profiles. The surgery subgroup had less low risk (9%v21%) and more high risk (37% v 30%) classified people.
Conclusion
SBST scores did not differentiate surgical from non-surgical pathologies. It seems unlikely that symptom questionnaires can estimate prognosis accurately unless everyone has the same diagnosis, not just the same symptom. Diagnosis, rather than questionnaire scores, should guide treatment and inform prognosis.","/content/10.1101/19005041v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005041v1.full.pdf","2019-08-20","Health Policy

"Cytological Abnormalities and its relation to CD4 count among HIV seropositive women living in Ahvaz, southwest of Iran","Introduction: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a known risk factor for abnormal cervical cytology and cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate cervical cytological abnormalities and its relation with CD4 (T4 Lymphocyte) count among HIV seropositive women. 
Methods: We conducted a study on 58 HIV positive women referred to Ahvaz Counseling Center for Behavioral Disease, southwest of Iran between 2016 and 2017. Pap smear was performed for all participants from the cervix and endocervix. Patient's characteristics including age, duration of disease, treatment with anti-retroviral treatment (ART), marital status, number of children, and contraception method were also recorded. Cervical cytological abnormalities reported as Bethesda system (TBS). A regular blood sample was taken from all the patients to evaluate the CD4 cells counts. Logistic regression models were used to obtain OR of presences of cytological abnormalities related to CD4 counts, controlling for important factors.
Results: Out of 58 patients only 5 were not under ART. We demonstrated that 29.3 % of patients had squamous cell abnormalities and these abnormalities, was more prevalent among 30-40 years old patients (70.6%). The prevalence of ASC-US (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance), LSIL (Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions) and HSIL (High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions) were 19.0%, 3.4%, and 6.9% respectively. Overall 9 patients need to repeat Pap smear test. Presence of cervical cytological abnormalities was not associated with the CD4 count, even after adjusting for the variable such age, duration of disease and ART.
Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of ASC-US in HIV-infected women which was independent of age, duration of diseases and history of ART. Though cervical cancer screening in this population might have a substantial public health benefit.","/content/10.1101/19004416v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004416v1.full.pdf","2019-08-20","HIV/AIDS

"Measuring stroke outcomes using linked administrative data: Population-based estimates and validation of home-time as a surrogate measure of functional status.","Abstract
Background: Administrative data offer cost-effective, whole-of-population stroke surveillance yet the lack of validated outcomes is a short-coming. The number of days spent living at home after stroke (home-time) is a patient-centred outcome that can be objectively ascertained from administrative data. Population-based validation against both severity and outcome measures and for all subtypes is lacking.
Methods: Stroke hospitalisations from a state-wide census in New South Wales, Australia, from July 1, 2005 to March 31, 2014 were linked to pre-hospital data, post-stroke admissions and deaths. We calculated correlations between 90-day home-time and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, measured upon initial contact with paramedics, and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores, measured upon entry to rehabilitation after the acute hospital stroke admission.  Negative binomial regressions were used to identify predictors of home-time. 
Results: Patients with stroke (N=74,501) spent a median of 53 days living at home after the event. Median home-time was 60 days after ischaemic stroke, 49 days after subarachnoid haemorrhage and 0 days after intracerebral haemorrhage. GCS and FIM scores significantly correlated with home-time (p-values<0.001). Female sex predicted less home-time in ischaemic stroke, while being married increased home time after ischaemic stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage. 
Conclusions: Home-time measured using administrative data is a robust, replicable and valid patient-centred outcome enabling inexpensive population-based surveillance.","/content/10.1101/19005082v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005082v1.full.pdf","2019-08-20","Health Informatics

"An emergent, high-fatality lung disease in systemic juvenile arthritis","Objective To investigate characteristics and risk factors of a novel parenchymal lung disease, increasingly detected in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA).
Methods In a multi-center retrospective study, 61 cases were investigated, using physician-reported clinical information and centralized analyses of radiologic, pathologic and genetic data.
Results Lung disease (LD) was associated with distinctive features, including acute erythematous clubbing and a high frequency of anaphylactic reactions to the IL-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab. Serum ferritin elevation and/or significant lymphopenia preceded LD detection. The most prevalent chest CT pattern was septal thickening, involving the periphery of multiple lobes +/- ground glass opacities. Predominant pathology (23/36) was pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and/or endogenous lipoid pneumonia (PAP/ELP), with atypical features, including regional involvement and concomitant vascular changes. Apparent severe delayed drug hypersensitivity occurred in some cases. 5-year survival was 42%. Whole-exome sequencing (20/61) did not identify a novel monogenic defect PAP-related or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)-related mutations as likely primary cause. Trisomy 21 (T21) increased LD risk, as did young sJIA onset. Refractory sJIA was not required for LD development. Exposure to interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 inhibitors (46/61) was associated with multiple LD features. By several indicators, severity of sJIA was comparable in drug-exposed subjects and published sJIA cohorts. MAS at sJIA onset was increased in the drug-exposed, but it was not associated with LD features. 
Conclusions A rare, life-threatening LD in sJIA is defined by a constellation of unusual clinical characteristics. The pathology, a PAP/ELP variant, suggests macrophage dysfunction. Inhibitor exposure may promote LD, independent of sJIA severity, in a small subset of treated patients. Treatment/prevention strategies are needed.","/content/10.1101/19002923v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002923v1.full.pdf","2019-08-20","Rheumatology

"Challenges in Building and Maintaining Rare Disease Patient Registries: Results of a Questionnaire Survey in Japan at 2012","[Background] Research infrastructure such as patient registries and biobanks is expected to play important roles by aggregating information and biospecimens to promote research and development for rare diseases. However, both building and maintaining them can be costly. This paper presents results of a survey of patient registries for rare diseases in Japan conducted at the end of 2012, with emphasis on clarifying costs and efforts related to building and maintaining them.
[Results] Of 31 patient registries in Japan found by searching a database of research grant reports and by searching the internet, 11 returned valid responses to this survey. Results show that labor and IT system costs are major expenses for developing and maintaining patient registries. Half of the respondent patient registries had no prospect of securing a budget to maintain them. Responders required the following support for patient registries: financial support, motivation of registrants (medical doctors or patients), and improved communication with and visibility to potential data users. These results resemble those reported from another survey conducted almost simultaneously in Europe (EPIRARE survey).
[Conclusions] Survey results imply that costs and efforts to build and maintain patient registries for many rare diseases make them unrealistic. Some alternative strategy is necessary to reduce burdens, such as offering a platform that supplies IT infrastructure and basic secretariat functions that can be used commonly among many patient registries.","/content/10.1101/19004770v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004770v1.full.pdf","2019-08-17","Health Informatics

"Evaluation of a rapid lateral flow calprotectin test for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection","Background: Microbiological diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) relies on culture techniques that are slow and insensitive. Rapid tests are urgently required to improve patient management. Calprotectin is a neutrophil biomarker of inflammation that has been demonstrated to be effective for the diagnosis of PJI. A calprotectin based lateral flow test has been developed for the rapid detection of PJI using synovial fluid samples.
Methods: A convenience series of 69 synovial fluid samples from patients at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals (NNUH) were collected intraoperatively from 52 hip and 17 knee revision operations. Calprotectin levels were measured using a new commercially available lateral flow assay for PJI diagnosis (Lyfstone). For all samples, synovial fluid was pipetted onto the lateral flow device and the signal was read using a mobile phone app after 15 minutes incubation at room temperature.
Results: According to the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria, 24 patients were defined as PJI positive and the remaining 45 were negative. The overall accuracy of the lateral flow test against the MSIS criteria was 75%. The test had a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 76% respectively with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 62% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 85%. Discordant results were then reviewed by the clinical team using available patient data to develop an alternative gold standard for defining presence/absence of infection (MSIS+). Compared to MSIS+, the test showed an overall accuracy of 83%, sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 78% respectively, a PPV of 62% and an NPV of 98%. Test accuracy for hip revisions was 77% and for knee revisions was 100%.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the calprotectin lateral flow assay is an effective diagnostic test for PJI. Our data suggests that the test is likely to generate false positive results in patients with metallosis and gross osteolysis.","/content/10.1101/19004473v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004473v1.full.pdf","2019-08-17","Orthopedics

"Atypical somatic symptoms in adults with prolonged recovery from mild traumatic brain injury","Somatization may contribute to persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In two independently-recruited study samples, we characterized the extent to which symptoms atypical of mTBI but typical for somatoform disorders (e.g., gastrointestinal upset, joint pain) were present in adult patients with prolonged recovery following mTBI. The first sample was cross-sectional and consisted of mTBI patients recruited from the community who reported ongoing symptoms attributable to a previous mTBI (n  = 16) along with a healthy control group (n = 15). The second sample consisted of patients with mTBI prospectively recruited from a Level 1 trauma center who had either good recovery (GOSE = 8; n = 33) or poor recovery (GOSE < 8; n = 29). In all participants, we evaluated atypical somatic symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 and typical post-concussion symptoms with the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire. Participants with poor recovery from mTBI had significantly higher 'atypical' somatic symptoms as compared to the healthy control group in Sample 1 (b = 4.308, p = 9.43E-5) and to mTBI patients with good recovery in Sample 2 (b = 3.287, p = 6.83E-04). As would be expected, participants with poor outcome in Sample 2 had a higher burden of typical rather than atypical symptoms (t(28) = 3.675, p = 9.97E-04, d = 0.94). However, participants with poor recovery still reported atypical somatic symptoms that were significantly higher (1.4 standard deviations, on average) than those with good recovery. Our results suggest that although 'typical' post-concussion symptoms predominate after mTBI, a broad range of somatic symptoms also frequently accompanies mTBI, and that somatization may represent an important, modifiable factor in mTBI recovery.","/content/10.1101/19004622v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004622v1.full.pdf","2019-08-17","Neurology

"A gene-diet interaction-based score predicts response to dietary fat in the Women's Health Initiative","While diet response prediction for cardiometabolic risk factors (CRFs) has been demonstrated using single SNPs and main-effect genetic risk scores, little investigation has gone into the development of genome-wide diet response scores. We sought to leverage the multi-study setup of the Women's Health Initiative cohort to generate and test genetic scores for the response of six CRFs (body mass index, systolic blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose) to dietary fat. A genome-wide interaction study was undertaken for each CRF in women (n ~ 10000) not participating in the Dietary Modification (DM) trial, which focused on the reduction of dietary fat. Genetic scores based on these analyses were developed using a pruning-and-thresholding approach and tested for the prediction of one-year CRF changes as well as long-term chronic disease development in DM trial participants (n ~ 5000). One of these genetic scores, for LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), predicted changes in the associated CRF. This 1760-variant score explained 3.4% of the variance in one-year LDL-C changes in the intervention arm, but was unassociated with changes in the control arm. In contrast, a main-effect genetic risk score for LDL-C was not useful for predicting dietary fat response. Further investigation of this score with respect to downstream disease outcomes revealed suggestive differential associations across DM trial arms, especially with respect to coronary heart disease and stroke subtypes. These results lay the foundation for the combination of many genome-wide gene-diet interactions for diet response prediction while highlighting the need for further research and larger samples in order to achieve robust biomarkers for use in personalized nutrition.","/content/10.1101/19004937v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004937v1.full.pdf","2019-08-17","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Comparison of risk factors for coronary heart disease morbidity versus mortality","Owing to the often prohibitively high costs of medical examinations, or an absence of infrastructure for linkage of study members to morbidity registries, much aetiological research in the field of cardiovascular research relies on death records.  Because they are regarded as being more distal to risk factor assessment than morbidity endpoints, mortality data are generally maligned in this context for seemingly providing less clear insights into aetiology.  The relative utility of mortality versus morbidity registries is, however, untested.  In a pooling of data from three large cohort studies whose participants had been linked to both death and morbidity registries for coronary heart disease, we related a range of established and emerging risk factors to these two methods of ascertainment.  A mean duration of study member surveillance of 10.1 years (mortality) and 9.9 years (morbidity) for a maximum of 20,956 study members (11,868 women) in the analytical sample yielded 289 deaths from coronary heart disease and 770 hospitalisations for this condition.  The direction of the age- and sex-adjusted association was the same for 21 of the 24 risk factor-morbidity/mortality combinations. The only marked discordance in effect estimates, such that different conclusions about the association could be drawn, was for social support, total cholesterol, and fruit/vegetable consumption whereby null effects were evident for selected outcomes.  In conclusion, variation in disease definition typically did not have an impact on the direction of the association of an array of risk factors for coronary heart disease.","/content/10.1101/19004994v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004994v1.full.pdf","2019-08-17","Epidemiology

"Redefining the Bladder Cancer Phenotype using Patterns of Familial Risk","Relatives of bladder cancer (BCa) patients have been shown to be at increased risk for kidney, lung, thyroid, and cervical cancer after correcting for smoking related behaviors that may concentrate in some families.  We demonstrate a new method to simultaneously assess risks for multiple cancers to identify distinct multi-cancer configurations (multiple different cancer types that cluster in relatives) surrounding BCa patients. We identified 6,416 individuals with urothelial carcinoma and familial information using the Utah Cancer Registry and Utah Population Database (UPDB).  First-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, and first cousins were used to construct a familial enrichment matrix for cancer-types previously shown to be individually associated with BCa. K-medioids clustering were used to identify Familial Multi-Cancer Configurations (FMC).   A case-control design and Cox regression with a 1:5 ratio of BCa cases to cancer-free controls was used to quantify the risk in specific relative-types and spouses in each FMC.  Clustering analysis revealed 12 distinct FMCs, each exhibiting a different pattern of cancer co-aggregation.  Of the 12 FMCs, four exhibited strong familial risk of bladder cancer along with specific patterns of increased risk of cancers in other sites (BCa FMCs), and were the focus of further investigation. Cancers at increased risk in these four BCa FMCs most commonly included melanoma, prostate and breast cancer and less commonly included leukemia, lung, pancreas and kidney cancer.  A network-based approach can be used with familial data to discover new phenotype clusters for BCa, providing new directions for discovering patterns of cancer clustering.","/content/10.1101/19003681v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003681v1.full.pdf","2019-08-16","Epidemiology

"Diet-derived fruit and vegetable metabolites suggest sex-specific mechanisms conferring protection against osteoporosis in humans","The impact of nutrition on the metabolic profile of osteoporosis is incompletely characterized. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to detangle the association of fruit and vegetable (FV) intakes with osteoporosis prevalence. Dietary, anthropometric and blood plasma metabolite data were examined from the Boston Puerto Rican Osteoporosis Study, a cohort of 600 individuals (age 46-79yr). High FV intake was protective against osteoporosis prevalence (Odds Ratio=0.73; 95% CI = 0.57, 0.94; P=0.013). Associations of 525 plasma metabolites were assessed with fruit and vegetable intake, and separately with osteoporosis status. Several biological processes affiliated with the FV-associating metabolites, including caffeine metabolism, carnitines and fatty acids, and glycerophospholipids. For osteoporosis-associated metabolites, important processes were steroid hormone biosynthesis in women, and branched-chain amino acid metabolism in men. In all instances, the metabolite patterns differed greatly between sexes, arguing for a stratified nutrition approach in recommending FV intakes to improve bone health. Factors derived from principal components analysis of the FV intakes were correlated with the osteoporosis-associated metabolites, with high intake of dark leafy greens and berries/melons appearing protective in both sexes. These data warrant investigation into whether increasing intakes of dark leafy greens, berries and melons causally affect bone turnover and BMD among adults at risk for osteoporosis via sex-specific metabolic pathways, and how gene-diet interactions alter these sex-specific metabolomic-osteoporosis links.","/content/10.1101/19003848v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003848v1.full.pdf","2019-08-15","Nutrition

"A comparison of contemporary versus older studies of aspirin for primary prevention","Objective: This study compares the benefits and harms of aspirin for primary prevention before and after widespread use of statins and colorectal cancer screening.
Methods: We compared studies of aspirin for primary prevention that recruited patients from 2005 onward with previous individual patient meta-analyses that recruited patients from 1978 to 2002. Data for contemporary studies were synthesized using random-effects models. We report vascular (major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE], myocardial infarction [MI], stroke), bleeding, cancer, and mortality outcomes. 
Results: The IPD analyses of older studies included 95,456 patients for CV prevention and 25,270 for cancer mortality, while the four newer studies had 61,604 patients. Relative risks for vascular outcomes for older vs newer studies follow: MACE: 0.89 (95% CI 0.83-0.95) vs 0.93 (0.86-0.99); fatal hemorrhagic stroke: 1.73 (1.11-2.72) vs 1.06 (0.66-1.70); any ischemic stroke: 0.86 (0.74-1.00) vs 0.86 (0.75-0.98); any MI: 0.84 (0.77-0.92) vs 0.88 (0.77-1.00); and non-fatal MI: 0.79 (0.71-0.88) vs 0.94 (0.83-1.08). Cancer death was not significantly decreased in newer studies (RR 1.11, 0.92-1.34). Major hemorrhage was significantly increased for both older and newer studies (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.25-1.76 vs 1.37, 95% CI 1.24-1.53). There was no effect in either group on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, fatal stroke, or fatal MI. 
Conclusions: In the modern era characterized by widespread statin use and cancer screening, aspirin does not reduce the risk of non-fatal MI or cancer death. There are no mortality benefits and a significant risk of major hemorrhage. Aspirin should no longer be recommended for primary prevention.","/content/10.1101/19004267v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004267v1.full.pdf","2019-08-15","Cardiovascular Medicine

Methods: Ninety-two microscopically confirmed patients were allocated to Terb (6 mg/kg/day), Itra (5 mg/kg/day), TI (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day, itraconazole 5 mg/kg/day), or TIp (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day, itraconazole 10 mg/kg/day for 1 week in 4 weeks) group by concealed block randomization and treated for 8 weeks or cure.
Results: Cure rates were similar at 4 weeks (P=0.768). At 8 weeks, 5 (21.7%), 18 (78.3%), 16 (69.6%), and 16 (69.6%) patients were cured in Terb, Itra, TI, and TIp groups, respectively. All experimental regimens (Itra, TI, TIp) were more effective than Terb (P=0.0027). All experimental regimens had similar effectiveness (P=0.738).  Relapse rates 4 and 8 weeks after cure were similar (P=0.869 and 0.314, respectively). Number-needed-to-treat (NNT) was 2 for Itra, 3 for TI, and 3 for TIp.
Conclusions: Oral itraconazole given daily (NNT=2) is the most effective treatment and combining it with terbinafine does not increase effectiveness.","/content/10.1101/19003947v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003947v1.full.pdf","2019-08-15","Dermatology

"Elucidating user behaviours in a digital health surveillance system to correct prevalence estimates","Estimating seasonal influenza prevalence is of undeniable public health importance, but remains challenging with traditional datasets due to cost and timeliness. Digital epidemiology has the potential to address this challenge, but can introduce sampling biases that are distinct to traditional systems. In online, participatory health surveillance systems, the voluntary nature of the data generating process must be considered to address potential biases in estimates. Here we examine user behaviours in one such platform, FluTracking, from 2011 to 2017. We build a Bayesian model to estimate probabilities of an individual reporting in each week, given their past reporting behaviour, and to infer the weekly prevalence of influenza-like-illness (ILI) in Australia. We show that a model that corrects for user behaviour can substantially effect ILI estimates. The model examined here elucidates several factors, such as prior reporting of ILI and consistency of prior reporting, that are strongly associated with the likelihood of participating in online health surveillance systems. This framework could be applied to other digital participatory health systems where participation is inconsistent and sampling bias may be of concern.","/content/10.1101/19003715v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003715v1.full.pdf","2019-08-15","Epidemiology

"Measuring Baseline Health with Individual Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (iHALE)","Objectives: At any point of time, a person's baseline health is the number of healthy life years they are expected to experience during the course of their lifetime. In this article we propose an equity-relevant health metric, illness-specific individual Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (iHALE), that facilitates comparison of baseline health for individuals at the onset of different medical conditions, and allows for the assessment of which patient groups are worse off. A method for calculating iHALE is presented, and we use this method to rank four conditions in six countries according to several criteria of ""worse off"" as a proof of concept. 

Methods: iHALE measures baseline health at an individual level for specific conditions, and consists of two components: past health (before disease onset) and future expected health (after disease onset). Four conditions (acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), schizophrenia, and epilepsy) are analysed in six countries (Ethiopia, Haiti, China, Mexico, United States and Japan). Data for all countries and for all diseases in 2017 were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study database. In order to assess who are the worse off, we focus on four measures: the proportion of affected individuals who are expected to attain less than 20 healthy life years (T20), the 25th and 75th percentiles of healthy life years for affected individuals (Q1 and Q3, respectively),  and the average iHALE across all affected individuals. 

Results: Even in settings where average iHALE is similar for two conditions, other measures may vary. One example is AML (average iHALE=58.7, T20=2.1, Q3-Q1=15.3) and ALL (57.7, T20=4.7, Q3-Q1=21.8) in the US. Many illnesses, such as epilepsy, are associated with higher baseline health in high-income settings (average iHALE in Japan=64.3) than in low-income settings (average iHALE in Ethiopia=36.8).

Conclusion: iHALE allows for the estimation of the distribution of baseline health of all individuals in a population. Hence, baseline health can be incorporated as an equity consideration in setting priorities for health interventions.","/content/10.1101/19003814v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003814v1.full.pdf","2019-08-15","Medical Ethics

"Peripheral Biomarkers of Tobacco-Use Disorder: A Systematic Review","Introduction: Tobacco use disorder (TUD) is a major worldwide healthcare burden resulting in 7 million deaths annually. TUD has few approved cessation aids, all of which are associated a high rate of relapse within one year. Biomarkers of TUD severity, treatment response, and risk of relapse have high potential clinical utility to identify ideal responders and guide additional treatment resources. 
Methods: A MEDLINE search was performed using the terms biomarkers, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, bilirubin, inositol, cotinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, pituitary-adrenal system, homovanillic acid, dopamine, pro-opiomelanocortin, lipids, lipid metabolism all cross-referenced with tobacco-use disorder. 
Results: The search yielded 424 results, of which 57 met inclusion criteria. The most commonly studied biomarkers were those related to nicotine metabolism, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and cardiovascular (CVD) risk. Nicotine metabolism was most associated with severity of dependence and treatment response, where as HPA axis and CVD markers showed less robust associations with dependence and relapse risk.
Conclusions: Nicotine-metabolite ratio, cortisol, and atherogenicity markers appear to be the most promising lead biomarkers for further investigation, though the body of literature is still preliminary. Longitudinal, repeated-measures studies are required to determine the directionality of the observed associations and determine true predictive power of these biomarkers. Future studies should also endeavour to study populations with comorbid psychiatric disorders to determine differences in utility of certain biomarkers.","/content/10.1101/19004150v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004150v1.full.pdf","2019-08-14","Addiction Medicine

"Assessment of Bias in Estimates of Sexual Network Degree using Prospective Cohort Data","Background: Sexual network degree, a count of ongoing partnerships, plays a critical role in HIV/STI transmission dynamics. Degree is often quantified using self-reported cross-sectional data on the day of survey, but this may result in bias because of uncertainty about predicting future sexual activity. 

Methods: We evaluated the bias of a cross-sectional degree measure with a prospective cohort study of men who have sex with men (MSM). At baseline, men were asked about whether recent sexual partnerships were ongoing. The true ongoing status of those partnerships at baseline was confirmed at follow-up. With logistic regression, we estimated the partnership-level predictors of baseline measure accuracy. With Poisson regression, we estimated the longitudinally confirmed degree as a function of baseline predicted degree.

Results: Across partnership types, the baseline ongoing status measure was 70% accurate, with higher negative predictive value (91%) than positive predictive value (39%). Partnership factors associated with higher accuracy included partnership exclusivity and racial pairing. Baseline degree generally overestimated confirmed degree. The bias, or the number of ongoing partners different than predicted at baseline, was -0.28 overall. This ranged from -1.91 to -0.41 for MSM with any ongoing partnerships at baseline. Comparing MSM of the same baseline degree, the level of bias was stronger for black MSM compared to white MSM, and for younger MSM compared to older MSM. 

Conclusions: Degree may be overestimated in studies when quantified cross-sectionally. Research studies and HIV/STI prevention interventions using degree measures should account for this bias through adjustment and structured sensitivity analyses.","/content/10.1101/19003830v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003830v1.full.pdf","2019-08-14","Epidemiology

"An Efficient and Robust Approach to Detect Auditory Evoked Responses using Adaptive Averaging","Objective: the auditory brainstem response is widely employed to evaluate hearing function of test subjects for both clinical and research purposes. Currently, hearing threshold estimation still relies on trained professionals to assess the audiograms, resulting in the largest cost component of the test. The objective of this study was to develop an automated approach to objectively and reliably detect the hearing thresholds.
Design: From eight mice and four human participants, we recorded for each sound level hundreds of single sweeps and asked how many sweeps were minimum required for a response being detected from cumulative averages using correlation function. We named this procedure the adaptive averaging approach.
Result: We found an exponential increase in the required sweeps at near-threshold sound levels, modeling of which allowed objective and precise threshold estimation. The results from mouse and human recordings deviated consistently less than 5 dB from the expert-assessed values. Moreover, up to 69 % sweeps at suprathreshold sound tests were found redundant for the threshold estimation and could be avoided to improve test efficiency.
Conclusions: The adaptive averaging approach achieved objective and precise hearing threshold detection and implementation of this approach in commercial recording devices will automate the hearing test in a more reliable and cost-effective way.","/content/10.1101/19003301v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003301v1.full.pdf","2019-08-13","Otolaryngology

"A systematic review of medical and clinical research landscapes and quality in Malaysia and Indonesia [REALQUAMI]: the review protocol","Background: Research landscapes and quality may change in many ways. Much research waste has been increasingly reported. Efforts to improve research performance will need good data on the profiles and performance of past research. 
Purpose: To describe the characteristics and quality of clinical and biomedical research in Malaysia and Indonesia. 
Methods: A search will be conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO to identify for published clinical and biomedical research from 1962 to 2017 from Malaysia and/or Indonesia. Additional search will also be conducted in MyMedR (for Malaysian team only). Studies found will be independently screened by a team of reviewers, relevant information will be extracted and quality of articles will be assessed. As part of quality control, another reviewer will independently assess 10-20% of the articles extracted. In Phase 1, the profiles of the published research will be reported descriptively. In Phase 2, a research quality screening tool will be validated to assess research quality based on three major domains of relevance, credibility of the methods and usefulness of the results. Associations between the research characteristics and quality will be analysed. The independent effect of each of the determinant will be quantified in multivariable regression analysis. Longitudinal trends of the research profiles, health conditions in different settings will be explored. Depending on the availability of resources, this review project may proceed according to the different clinical and biomedical disciplines in sequence.
Discussion: Results of this study will serve as the 'baseline' data for future evaluation and within country and between countries comparison. This review may also provide informative results to stakeholders of the evolution of research conduct and performance from the past till now. The longitudinal and prospective trends of the research profiles and quality could provide suggestions on improvement initiatives. Additionally, health conditions or areas in different settings, and whether they are over- or under-studied may help future prioritization of research initiatives and resources.","/content/10.1101/19004010v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004010v1.full.pdf","2019-08-13","Epidemiology

"Childhood coordination and survival up to six decades later: extended follow-up of participants in the National Child Development Study","Background: Poorer performance on standard tests of motor coordination in children has emerging links with sedentary behaviour, obesity, and functional capacity in later life.  These observations are suggestive of an as-yet untested association of coordination with health outcomes. 
Objective:  To examine the association of performance on a series of psychomotor coordination tests in childhood with mortality up to six decades later. 
Design, Setting, and Participants:  The National Child Development Study (1958 birth cohort study) is a prospective cohort study based on a nationally representative sample of births from England, Scotland and Wales.  A total of 17,415 individuals had their gross and fine motor psychomotor coordination assessed using nine tests at 11 and 16 years of age.
Main outcome and measure:  All-cause mortality as ascertained from a vital status registry and survey records. 
Results:  Mortality surveillance between 7 and 58 years of age in an analytical sample of 17,336 men and women yielded 1,090 deaths.  After adjustment for sex, higher scores on seven of the nine childhood coordination tests were associated with a lower risk of mortality in a stepwise manner.  After further statistical control for early life socioeconomic, health, cognitive, and developmental factors, relations at conventional levels of statistical significance remains for three tests:  ball catching at age 11 (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval for 0-8 versus 10 catches: 1.56; 1.21, 2.01), match-picking at age 11 (>50 seconds versus 0-36: 1.33; 1.03, 1.70), and hopping at age 16 years (very unsteady versus very steady: 1.29; 1.02, 1.64).

"Generalisability of Results from UK Biobank: Comparison With a Pooling of 18 Cohort Studies","Background: The UK Biobank cohort study has become a much-utilised and influential scientific resource.  With a primary goal of understanding disease aetiology, the low response to the original survey of 5.5% has, however, led to debate as to the generalisability of these findings.  We therefore compared risk factor-disease estimations in UK Biobank with those from 18 nationally representative studies with conventional response rates.
Methods: We used individual-level baseline data from UK Biobank (N=502,655) and a pooling of data from the Health Surveys for England (HSE) and the Scottish Health Surveys (SHS), comprising 18 studies and 89,895 individuals (mean response rate 68%).  Both study populations were aged 40-69 years at study induction and linked to national cause-specific mortality registries.  
Findings: Despite a typically more favourable risk factor profile and lower mortality rates in UK Biobank participants relative to the HSE-SHS consortium, risk factors-endpoints associations were directionally consistent between studies, albeit with some heterogeneity in magnitude.  For instance, for cardiovascular disease mortality, the age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for ever having smoked cigarettes (versus never) was 2.04 (1.87, 2.24) in UK Biobank and 1.99 (1.78, 2.23) in HSE-SHS, yielding a ratio of hazard ratios close to unity (1.02, 0.88, 1.19; p-value 0.76).  For hypertension (versus none), corresponding results were again in same direction but with a lower effect size in UK Biobank (1.89; 1.69, 2.11) than in HSE-SHS (2.56; 2.20, 2.98), producing a ratio of hazard ratios below unity (0.74; 0.62, 0.89; p-value 0.001).  A similar pattern of observations were made for risk factors (smoking, obesity, educational attainment, and physical stature) in relation to different cancer presentations and suicide whereby the ratios of hazard ratios ranged from 0.57 (0.40, 0.81) and 1.07 (0.42, 2.74).
Interpretation: Despite a low response rate, aetiological findings from UK Biobank appear to be generalisable to England and Scotland.","/content/10.1101/19004705v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004705v1.full.pdf","2019-08-13","Epidemiology

"Prospective Trial Registration and Publication Rates of Randomized Clinical Trials in Digital Health: A Cross Sectional Analysis of Global Trial Registries","Registration of clinical trials was introduced to mitigate the risk of publication and selective reporting bias in the realm of clinical research. The prevalence of publication and selective reporting bias in trial results has been evidenced through scientific research. This bias may compromise the ethical and methodological conduct in the design, implementation and dissemination of evidence-based healthcare interventions. Principal investigators of digital health trials may be overwhelmed with challenges that are unique to digital health research, such as the usability of the intervention under test, participant recruitment, and retention challenges that may contribute to non-publication rate and prospective trial registration. Our primary research objective was to examine the prevalence of prospective registration and publication rates in digital health trials. We included 417 trials that enrolled participants in 2012 and were registered in any of the seventeen WHO registries. The prospective registration and publication rates were at (38.4%) and (65.5%) respectively. We identified a statistically significant (P<.001) ""Selective Registration Bias"" with 95.7% of trials published within a year after registration, were registered retrospectively. We reported a statistically significant relationship (P=.003) between prospective registration and funding sources, with industry-funded trials having the lowest compliance with prospective registration at (14.3%). The lowest non-publication rates were in the Middle East (26.7%) and Europe (28%), and the highest were in Asia (56.5%) and the U.S. (42.5%). We found statistically significant differences (P<.001) between trial location and funding sources with the highest percentage of industry funded trials in Asia (17.3%) and the U.S. (3.3%).","/content/10.1101/19004390v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004390v1.full.pdf","2019-08-13","Health Informatics

"Applications of qualitative grounded theory methodology to investigate hearing loss: Protocol for a qualitative systematic review","ABTRACT
Introduction: Hearing loss is a chronic condition affecting 11 million individuals in the UK. People with hearing loss regularly experience difficulties interacting in everyday conversations. These difficulties in communication can result in a person with hearing loss withdrawing from social situations and becoming isolated. While hearing health loss research has largely deployed quantitative methods to investigate various aspects of the condition, qualitative research is becoming more widespread. Grounded theory is a specific qualitative methodology that has been used to establish novel theories on the experiences of living with hearing loss. 

Method and analysis:  The aim of this systematic review is to establish how grounded theory has been applied to investigate the psychosocial aspects of hearing loss. Methods are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 checklist. Studies included in this review will have applied grounded theory methodology. For a study to be included, it can apply grounded theory as an overarching methodology, or have grounded theory methodology embedded amongst other methodologies. These studies can be in the form of retrospective or prospective studies, before and after comparison studies, RCTs, non-RCTs, cohort studies, prospective observational studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies, and mixed method studies. Purely quantitative studies, studies that have not applied grounded theory methodology, articles reporting expert opinions, case reports, practice guidelines, case series, conference abstracts, and book chapters will be excluded. Studies included will have adult participants (=18 years) who are either people with an acquired hearing loss, their family and friends (communication partners), or audiologists. The quality of application of grounded theory in each study will be assessed using the Guideline for Reporting and Evaluating Grounded Theory Research Studies (GUREGT).

Ethics and dissemination:  As only secondary data will be used in this systematic review, ethical approval is not required. No other ethical issues are foreseen. The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (http://www crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO) holds the registration record of this systematic review. Findings will be disseminated via peer reviewed publications and at relevant academic conferences. Findings may also be published in relevant professional and third sector newsletters and magazines as appropriate. Data will inform future research and guideline development.

Prospero registration number:  PROSPERO CRD42019134197

Strengths and limitations of this study:
This systematic review is the first to provide a comprehensive critique of the use of grounded theory to investigate hearing loss. 
The search strategy was formed in collaboration with an information specialist at the University of Nottingham. 
The PRISMA-P guidelines have directed the considerations and layout of this protocol. 
Because experiences and articulations of hearing loss are influenced by age, only adult (=18 years) participants (people with hearing loss, communication partners, audiologists) will be considered.
The search will not include grey literature. 
The studies included will only have samples of individuals with hearing loss, rather than full deafness.","/content/10.1101/19004259v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004259v1.full.pdf","2019-08-13","Otolaryngology

"Prevalence of diabetic foot ulcer and its association with duration of illness and residence in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Abstract 
Background: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), devastating complications of diabetes mellitus, is a major public health problem, and one of the leading reasons for hospital admission, amputations, and even death among diabetic patients in Ethiopia. Despite its catastrophic health consequences, the national burden of diabetic foot ulcer remains unknown in Ethiopia. Hence, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the national prevalence of diabetic foot ulcer and investigate the association with duration of illness and patient residence among diabetic patients.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases for studies of diabetic foot ulcers prevalence that published from conception up to June 30, 2019. Quality of each article was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cross-sectional studies. All statistical analyses were done using STATA version 14 software for Windows, and meta-analysis was carried out using a random-effects method. The pooled national prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers was presented using a forest plot.
Results: A total of 10 studies with 3,029 diabetic patients were included. The pooled national prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers among Ethiopian diabetic patients was 11.27% (95% CI 7.22, 15.31%, I2=94.6). Duration of illness (OR: 3.91, 95%CI 2.03, 7.52, I2=63.4%) and patient residence (OR: 3.40, 95%CI 2.09, 5.54, I2=0.0%) were significantly associated with a diabetic foot ulcer.
Conclusion: In Ethiopia, at least one out of ten diabetic patients had diabetic foot ulcers. Healthcare policymakers (FMoH) need to improve the standard of diabetic care and should design effective preventive strategies to improve health care delivery for people with diabetes and reduce the risk of foot ulceration.

"Transcriptional survey of peripheral blood links lower oxygen saturation during sleep with reduced expressions of CD1D and RAB20 that is reversed by CPAP therapy","Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is associated with a wide range of physiological changes due, in part, to the influence of hypoxemia during sleep. We studied gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in association with three measures of SDB: Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI); average oxyhemoglobin saturation (avgO2) during sleep; and minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation (minO2) during sleep. We performed discovery association analysis in two community-based studies, the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS; N=571) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; N = 580). An association with false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05 in one study was considered replicated if a p < 0.05 was observed in the other study. Those genes that replicated across MESA and FOS, or with FDR q < 0.05 in meta-analysis, were used for analysis of gene expression in the blood of 15 participants from the Heart Biomarkers In Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) trial. HeartBEAT participants had moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and were studied pre- and post-treatment (three months) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). We also performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on all traits and cohort analyses. Twenty-two genes were associated with SDB traits in both MESA and FOS. Of these, lower expression of CD1D and RAB20 was associated with lower avgO2 in MESA and FOS. CPAP treatment increased the expression of these genes in HeartBEAT participants. Immunity and inflammation pathways were up-regulated in subjects with lower avgO2; i.e., in those with a more severe SDB phenotype (MESA), whereas immuno-inflammatory processes were down-regulated in response to CPAP treatment (HeartBEAT).","/content/10.1101/19001727v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001727v1.full.pdf","2019-08-12","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Depletion-of-susceptibles bias in influenza vaccine waning studies: how to ensure robust results","Vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies are subject to biases due to depletion of at-risk persons or of highly susceptible persons at different rates from different groups (depletion-of-susceptibles bias), a problem that can also lead to biased estimates of waning effectiveness, including spurious inference of waning when none exists. An alternative study design to identify waning is to study only vaccinated persons, and compare for each day the incidence in persons with earlier or later dates of vaccination. Prior studies suggested under what conditions this alternative would yield correct estimates of waning. Here we define the depletion-of-susceptibles process formally and show mathematically that for influenza vaccine waning studies, a randomized trial or corresponding observational study that compares incidence at a specific calendar time among individuals vaccinated at different times before the influenza season begins will not be vulnerable depletion-of-susceptibles bias in its inference of waning under the null hypothesis that none exists, and will - if waning does actually occur - underestimate the extent of waning. Such a design is thus robust in the sense that a finding of waning in that inference framework reflects actual waning of vaccine-induced immunity. We recommend such a design for future studies of waning, whether observational or randomized.","/content/10.1101/19003616v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003616v1.full.pdf","2019-08-12","Epidemiology

"Examining Gender Differences in Opioid, Benzodiazepine, and Antibiotic Prescribing","While gender differences have been explored across several areas of medicine, our study is the first to present a systematic comparison of drug prescribing behavior of male and female providers, including opioid, benzodiazepine, and antibiotic prescribing.  Our work is of particular relevance to the current opioid crisis and other iatrogenic harms related to injudicious prescribing. Our objective is to explore prescribing differences between male and female providers across medical specialties and for different prescription drug categories in Medicare Part D.  To this end, we performed a descriptive, retrospective study of 1.13 million medical providers who made drug claims to Medicare Part D in 2016, analyzing gender, specialty, and drug category. We found that male providers across diverse specialties prescribe significantly more medications, including opioids, benzodiazepines, and antibiotics than female providers by volume, cost, and per patient. These observed gender differences in prescribing, while agnostic to the quality of care provided, nonetheless inform the design of prevention strategies that seek to reduce iatrogenic harms related to prescribing.","/content/10.1101/19003533v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003533v1.full.pdf","2019-08-12","Health Informatics

"Associations of childcare type, age at start, and intensity with body mass index trajectories from 10 to 42 years of age in the 1970 British Cohort Study","Background: Attending childcare is related to greater childhood obesity risk, but there are few long-term follow-up studies. We aimed to examine the associations of childcare type, duration, and intensity with BMI trajectories from ages 10-42 years. 

Methods: The sample comprised 8234 individuals in the 1970 British Cohort Study, who had data on childcare attendance (no, yes), type (formal, informal), duration (4-5, 3-3.99, 0-2.99 years old when started), and intensity (1, 2, 3, 4-5 days/week) reported at age five years and 32563 BMI observations. Multilevel linear spline models were used to estimate the association of each exposure with the sample-average BMI trajectory, with covariate adjustment. A combined duration and intensity exposure was also examined. 

Results: Childcare attendance and type were not strongly related to BMI trajectories. Among participants who attended childcare 1-2 days a week, those who started when 3-3.99 years old had a 0.197 (-0.004, 0.399) kg/m2 higher BMI at age 10 years than those who started when 4-5 years old, and those who started when 0-2.99 years old had a 0.289 (0.049, 0.529) kg/m2 higher BMI. A similar dose-response pattern for intensity was observed when holding duration constant. By age 42 years, individuals who started childcare at age 0-2.99 years and attended 3-5 days/week had a 1.356 kg/m2 (0.637, 2.075) higher BMI than individuals who started at age 4-5 years and attended 1-2 days/week. 

Conclusions: Children who start childcare earlier and/ or attend more frequently may have greater long-term obesity risk.","/content/10.1101/19003772v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003772v1.full.pdf","2019-08-12","Epidemiology

"A flexible formula for incorporating distributive concerns into cost-effectiveness analyses: priority weights","Cost effectiveness analyses (CEAs) are widely used to evaluate the opportunity cost of health care investments. However, few functions that take equity concerns into account are available for such CEA methods, and these concerns are therefore at risk of being disregarded. Among the functions that have been developed, most focus on the distribution of health gains, as opposed to the distribution of lifetime health. This is despite the fact that there are good reasons to give higher priority to individuals and groups with a low health adjusted life expectancy. Also, an even distribution of health gains may imply an uneven distribution of lifetime health. 
We develop a systematic and explicit approach that allows for the inclusion of lifetime health concerns in CEAs, by creating a new priority weight function, PW=a+(t-<U+03B3>)Â·CÂ·e-ÃŸÂ·(t-<U+03B3>), where t is the health measure. PW has several desirable properties. First, it is continuous and smooth, ensuring that people with similar health characteristics are treated alike. Second, it is flexible regarding shape and outcome measure, so that a broad range of values may be modelled. Third, the coefficients have distinct roles. This allows for the easy manipulation of the PW's shape. In order to demonstrate how PW may be applied, we use data from a previous study and estimated the coefficients of PW based on two approaches. 
The first considers the mean weights assigned by the respondents:
PWmean=-0.42+(t+22.2)Â·0.27Â·e-0.031Â·(t+22.2) . 
The second considers the median weights:
PWmedian=0.79+(t+8.85)Â·0.17Â·e-0.053Â·(t+8.85) . 
This illustrates that our framework allows for the estimation of PWs based on empirical data.","/content/10.1101/19003780v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003780v1.full.pdf","2019-08-12","Health Economics

"Immunoglobulin E as a biomarker for the overlap of atopic asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) is a common clinical syndrome, yet there is no single objective definition. We hypothesized that Immunoglobulin E measurements could be used to refine the definition of ACO. In baseline plasma samples from 2870 subjects in the COPDGene Study, we measured total IgE levels and specific IgE levels to six common allergens. Compared to usual COPD, subjects with ACO had higher total IgE levels (median 67.0 vs 42.2 IU/ml) and more frequently had at least one positive specific IgE (43.5 vs 24.5%). We previously used a strict definition of ACO in subjects with COPD, based on self-report of a doctor's diagnosis of asthma before the age of 40.  This strict ACO definition was refined by the presence of atopy, determined by total IgE gt;100 IU/ml or at least one positive specific IgE, as was a broader definition of ACO based on any asthma history. Subjects will all three ACO definitions were younger (mean age 60.0-61.3), were more commonly African American (36.8-44.2%), had a higher exacerbation frequency (1.0-1.2 in the past year), and had more airway wall thickening on quantitative analysis of chest CT scans. Among subjects with clinical ACO, 37-46% did not have atopy; these subjects had more emphysema on chest CT scan. Based on associations with exacerbations and CT airway disease, IgE did not clearly improve the clinical definition of ACO. However, IgE measurements could be used to subdivide subjects with atopic and non-atopic ACO, who might have different biologic mechanisms and potential treatments.","/content/10.1101/19004333v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004333v1.full.pdf","2019-08-12","Respiratory Medicine

"Insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, depression and socioeconomic status among customer service employees in Canada","Objectives: The present study alerts on the potential effect of working full time in a call center as a risk factor for neuropsychiatric illnesses. It is the first study investigating deeply presence of anxiety, depression, insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness among a large population of customer service employees. It has 3 specifics goals which were (1) document presence of sleep disorders among customer service advisors (2) document presence of anxiety and depression in this population (3) determine the influence of the socioeconomic status, duration in position and full time or part-time shift on the diseases above.
Findings: It was found that the majority of people working in customer service are undergraduate students or at a secondary/high school degree.  They worked full time, are single and have reported at least two of the neuropsychiatric disorders assessed in the present study. Among customer service advisors enrolled in this study, all neuropsychiatric disorders investigated were present and significantly higher for those working full time. Perceived socioeconomic status (pSES) was almost similar for full time and part time workers with a mean score of 4.8 on the MacArthur scale of subjective social status. Results revealed that duration in position was an excellent predictor of insomnia, sleepiness and anxiety (respectively with R2=91,83%, R2=81,23% and R2=87,46%) but a moderate predictor of depression (R2=69,14%). The pSES was a moderate predictor of sleep disorders (respectively R2=62,04% for insomnia and R2=53,62% for sleepiness) but had a strong association with anxiety and depression (R2=82,95% for anxiety and R2=89,77% for depression). It was found that insomnia and anxiety are more prevalent for immigrants and international students compared to Canadians, while depression was similarly higher for Canadian and immigrants compared to international students. It was found that sleepiness has the same trend in the three subgroups.
Conclusion: Customer service employees are exposed to a continuous stimulation of their cognitive functions in addition to different stressors which can progressively and silently damage the nervous system. Investigations on mental and physical health of customer service advisors are worthy of interest, and understanding how their work, their rotating shifts and their socioeconomic status influence their resilience and their performance at work; may help comprehension of similar health issues emerging in similar populations with similar occupations.","/content/10.1101/19003194v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003194v1.full.pdf","2019-08-12","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Identifying barriers and facilitators to physical activity for people with scleroderma: A nominal group technique study","Purpose: To identify physical activity barriers and facilitators experienced by people with systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma).
Materials and Methods: We conducted nominal group technique sessions with SSc patients who shared barriers to physical activities, barrier-specific facilitators, and general facilitators. Participants rated importance of barriers and likelihood of using facilitators from 0-10, and indicated whether they had tried facilitators. Barriers and facilitators across sessions were subsequently merged to eliminate overlap; edited based on feedback from investigators, patient advisors, and clinicians; and categorized.
Results: We conducted nine sessions (n=41 total participants) and initially generated 181 barriers, 457 barrier-specific facilitators, and 20 general facilitators. The number of consolidated barriers (barrier-specific facilitators in parentheses) for each category were: 14 (61) for health and medical; 4 (23) for social and personal; 1 (3) for time, work, and lifestyle; and 1 (4) for environmental. There were 12 consolidated general facilitators. The consolidated items with = 1/3 of participants' ratings = 8 were: 15 barriers, 69 barrier-specific facilitators, and 9 general facilitators.
Conclusions: People with SSc reported many barriers related to health and medical aspects of SSc and several barriers in other categories. They reported facilitators to remain physically active despite the barriers.","/content/10.1101/19004432v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004432v1.full.pdf","2019-08-11",NA,"Harb","/highwire/citation/68694/bibtext",513,"211119-513","21/11/2019","68694"
"Causal mediation analysis of Subclinical Hypothyroidism in children with obesity and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease","Context: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a common co-morbidity of obesity and a leading cause of liver disease in children. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) occurs with obesity and may contribute to dysmetabolic state that predisposes to NAFLD.
Objective: To assess the relationship between SH and NAFLD in children with biopsy-proven NAFLD compared to controls. 
Design and Methods: In this retrospective study of cases from a registry of children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and age-matched controls, the association of SH with NAFLD and other cardiometabolic parameters was assessed followed by causal mediation analyses under the counter-factual framework.  
Results: Sixty-six cases and 4067 age-matched controls were included in the study. Children with NAFLD were more likely to be male (74.6 vs 39.4%, p < 0.001), have higher modified BMI-z scores (2.3 Â±1.6 vs 1Â± 1.6, p < 0.001), and abnormal metabolic parameters (TSH, ALT, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG). Multivariate analyses controlling for age, sex and severity of obesity showed significant association between the 4th quartile of TSH and NAFLD. Causal mediation analysis demonstrates that TSH mediates 44% of the effect of modified BMI-z score on NAFLD. This comprises of 16.2% (OR = 1.1, p < 0.001) caused by the indirect effect of TSH and its interaction with modified BMI-z, and 26.5% (OR = 1.1, p = 0.01) as an autonomous effect of TSH on NAFLD regardless of the obesity.  
Conclusions: The association of SH and biopsy-proven NAFLD is demonstrated in a predominately Latino population. Further, a causal mediation analysis implicates an effect of TSH on NAFLD, independent of obesity.","/content/10.1101/19004242v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004242v1.full.pdf","2019-08-10","Pediatrics

"Elevated blood pressure in the emergency department - a risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease: An EHR-based cohort study","Objectives: In the emergency department (ED), high blood pressure (BP) is commonly observed but mostly used to evaluate patients' health in the short-term. We aimed to study whether ED-measured BP is associated with incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in long-term, and to estimate the number needed to screen (NNS) to prevent ASCVD.
Design: Electronic Health Records (EHR) and national register-based cohort study. The association between BP and incident ASCVD was studied with Cox-regression.
Setting: Two university hospital emergency departments in Sweden.
Data sources: BP data were obtained from EDs EHR, and outcome information was acquired through the Swedish National Patient Register for all participants. 
Participants: All patients =18 years old who visited the EDs between 2010 to 2016, with an obtained BP (n=300,193). 
Main outcome measures: Incident ASCVD, MI, and stroke during follow-up. 
Results: The subjects were followed for a median of 42 months. 8,999 incident ASCVD events occurred (MI: 4,847, stroke: 6,661). Both diastolic and systolic BP (SBP) was associated with incident ASCVD, MI, and stroke with a progressively increased risk for SBP within hypertension grade 1 (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.24), 2 (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.47), and 3 (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.77). The six-year cumulative incidence of ASCVD was 12% for patients with SBP =180 mmHg compared to 2% for normal levels. To prevent one ASCVD event during the median follow-up, NNS was estimated to 151, whereas NNT to 71.
Conclusions: BP in the ED is associated with incident ASCVD, MI, and stroke. High BP recordings in EDs should not be disregarded as isolated events, but an opportunity to detect and improve treatment of hypertension. ED-measured BP provides an important and under-used tool with great potential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension.","/content/10.1101/19004382v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004382v1.full.pdf","2019-08-10","Cardiovascular Medicine

"The Effects of Metronome Frequency Differentially Affects Gait on a Treadmill and Overground in People with Parkinson's Disease","Objective: To determine the effect of different metronome cue frequencies on spatiotemporal gait parameters when walking overground compared to walking on a treadmill in people with Parkinson's disease
Design: Repeated-measures, within-subject design
Setting: Research laboratory
Participants: Twenty-one people with Parkinson's disease (Hoehn & Yahr stage 1-3)
Interventions: Participants walked overground and on a treadmill with and without metronome cues of 85%, 100%, and 115% of their baseline cadence for one minute each.
Main Outcome Measures: Gait speed, step length, and cadence
Results: An interaction effect between cue frequency and walking environment revealed that participants took longer steps during the 85% condition on the treadmill only. When walking overground, metronome cues of 85% and 115% of baseline cadence yielded decreases and increases, respectively, in both cadence and gait speed with no concomitant change in step length. 
Conclusions: These data suggest that people with PD are able to alter spatiotemporal gait parameters immediately when provided the appropriate metronome cue and walking environment. We propose to target shortened step lengths by stepping to the beat of slow frequency auditory cues while walking on a treadmill, whereas the use of fast frequency cues during overground walking can facilitate faster walking speeds.","/content/10.1101/19003251v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003251v1.full.pdf","2019-08-09","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Association between the ACE I/D gene polymorphism and progressive renal failure in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: A meta-analysis","Objective The angiotensin converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) gene polymorphism is involved in a wide range of clinical outcomes. This makes ACE I/D an important genetic marker. Updating the genetic profile of ACE I/D and raising the evidence for its role in renal disease is therefore needed. Reported associations of ACE I/D with progressive renal failure (PRF) in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have been inconsistent, prompting a meta-analysis to obtain more precise estimates. 
Methods Multi-database search yielded 18 articles for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Risks (odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals) were estimated by comparing the ACE genotypes (heterozygote ID, homozygotes DD and II). Heterogeneous (random-effects) pooled associations were subjected to outlier treatment which yielded fixed-effects outcomes and split the findings into pre- (PRO) and post- (PSO) outlier status. Subgroup analysis was based on ethnicity (Asian/Caucasian) and minor allele frequency (maf). The =0.50 maf subgroup indicates higher frequency of the variant II genotype over that of the common DD genotype, otherwise, the subgroup is considered <0.50 maf. Stability of the associative effects was assessed with sensitivity treatment. Temporal trend of association was examined with cumulative meta-analysis.
Results In the PSO analysis, overall effects were null (ORs 0.99-1.02) but not in the subgroups (Asian and =0.50 maf), where in presence of the D allele (DD/ID) and the I allele (II), increased (ORs 1.63-5.62) and reduced (OR 0.22) risks were observed, respectively. Of these pooled effects, the Asian and =0.50 maf homozygous DD genotypes had high ORs (5.01-5.63) indicating elevated magnitude of effects that were highly significant (Pa <10-5) and homogeneous (I2 = 0%), in addition to their robustness. In contrast, the Caucasian and <0.50 maf subgroup effects were: (i)  non-heterogeneous (fixed-effects) at the outset, which did not require outlier treatment and (ii) non-significant (ORs 0.91-1.10, Pa = 0.15-0.79). Cumulative meta-analysis revealed increased precision of effects over time.  
Conclusions PRF in ADPKD impacted the Asian and =0.50 maf subgroups where DD homozygote carriers were up to 6-fold susceptible. The high magnitude of these effects were highly significant, homogeneous and robust indicating strong evidence of association.","/content/10.1101/19002949v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002949v1.full.pdf","2019-08-09","Nephrology

"Identifying Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1/2 founder variants in individuals who do not self-report Jewish ancestry","Current guidelines recommend BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing for individuals with a personal or family history of certain cancers. Three BRCA1/2 founder variants -- 185delAG (c.68_69delAG), 5382insC (c.5266dupC), and 6174delT (c.5946delT) -- are common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. We characterized a cohort of more than 2,800 research participants in the 23andMe database who carry one or more of the three Ashkenazi Jewish founder variants, evaluating two characteristics that are typically used to recommend individuals for BRCA testing: self-reported Jewish ancestry and family history of breast, ovarian, prostate, or pancreatic cancer. Of the 1,967 carriers who provided self-reported ancestry information, 21% did not self-report any Jewish ancestry; of these individuals, more than half (62%) do have detectable Ashkenazi Jewish genetic ancestry. In addition, of the 343 carriers who provided both ancestry and family history information, 44% did not have a first-degree family history of a BRCA-related cancer and, in the absence of a personal history of cancer, would therefore be unlikely to qualify for clinical genetic testing. These findings provide support for the growing call for broader access to BRCA genetic testing.","/content/10.1101/19001032v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001032v1.full.pdf","2019-08-09","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Increasing Heroin, Cocaine, and Buprenorphine Arrests Reported to the Maine Diversion Alert Program","Background: The opioid overdose crisis is especially pronounced in Maine. The Diversion Alert Program (DAP) was developed to combat illicit drug use and prescription drug diversion by facilitating communication between law enforcement and healthcare providers with the goal of limiting drug-related harms and criminal behaviors.  Our objectives in this report were to analyze 2014-2017 DAP for: 1) trends in drug arrests and, 2) differences in arrests by offense, demographics (sex and age) and by region.  

Methods: Drug charges (N = 8,193, 31.3% female, age = 33.1 Â± 9.9) reported to the DAP were examined by year, demographics, and location.  

Results: The most common substances of the 10,064 unique arrests reported were heroin (N = 2,203, 21.9%), crack/cocaine (N = 945, 16.8%), buprenorphine (N = 812, 8.1%), and oxycodone (N = 747, 7.4%).  While the overall number of arrests reported to the DAP declined in 2017, the proportion of arrests involving opioids (heroin, buprenorphine, or fentanyl) and stimulants (cocaine/crack cocaine, or methamphetamine), increased (p < .05).  Women had significantly increased involvement in arrests involving sedatives and miscellaneous pharmaceuticals (e.g. gabapentin) while men had an elevation in stimulant arrests. Heroin accounted for a lower percentage of arrests among individuals age = 60 (6.6%) relative to young-adults (18-29, 22.3%, p < .0001). Older-adults had significantly more arrests than younger-adults for oxycodone, hydrocodone, and marijuana. 

Conclusion: Heroin had the most arrests from 2014-2017. Buprenorphine, fentanyl and crack/cocaine arrests increased appreciably suggesting that improved treatment is needed to prevent further nonmedical use and overdoses.  The Diversion Alert Program provided a unique data source for research, a harm-reduction tool for health care providers, and an informational resource for law enforcement.","/content/10.1101/19003376v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003376v1.full.pdf","2019-08-09","Addiction Medicine

"Self-blaming emotions in major depression: a randomised pilot trial comparing fMRI neurofeedback training with self-guided psychological strategies (NeuroMooD)","Background: Overgeneralised self-blame and worthlessness are key symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) and were previously associated with self-blame-selective changes in connectivity between right superior anterior temporal lobe (rSATL) and subgenual frontal areas. In a previous study, remitted MDD patients successfully modulated guilt-selective rSATL-subgenual cingulate connectivity using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) neurofeedback training, thereby increasing their self-esteem. The feasibility and potential of using this approach in symptomatic MDD were unknown. 

Methods: This single-blind pre-registered randomised controlled pilot trial tested the clinical potential of a novel self-guided psychological intervention with and without additional rSATL-posterior subgenual cortex (SC) rtfMRI neurofeedback, targeting self-blaming emotions in insufficiently recovered people with MDD and early treatment-resistance (n=43, n=35 completers). Following a diagnostic baseline assessment, patients completed three self-guided sessions to rebalance self-blaming biases and a post-treatment assessment. The fMRI neurofeedback software FRIEND was used to measure rSATL-posterior SC connectivity, while the BDI-II was administered to assess depressive symptom severity as a primary outcome measure. 

Results: Both interventions were demonstrated to be safe and beneficial, resulting in a mean reduction of MDD symptom severity by 46% and response rates of more than 55%, with no group difference. Secondary analyses, however, revealed a differential response on our primary outcome measure between MDD patients with and without DSM-5 defined anxious distress. Stratifying by anxious distress features was investigated, because this was found to be the most common subtype in our sample. MDD patients without anxious distress showed a higher response to rtfMRI neurofeedback training compared to the psychological intervention, with the opposite pattern found in anxious MDD. We explored potentially confounding clinical differences between subgroups and found that anxious MDD patients were much more likely to experience anger towards others as measured on our psychopathological interview which might play a role in their poorer response to neurofeedback. In keeping with the hypothesis that self-worth plays a key role in MDD, improvement on our primary outcome measure was correlated with increases in self-esteem after the intervention and this correlated with the frequency with which participants employed the strategies to tackle self-blame outside of the treatment sessions.

Conclusions: These findings suggest that self-blame-selective rtfMRI neurofeedback training may be superior over a solely psychological intervention in non-anxious MDD, although further confirmatory studies are needed. The self-guided psychological intervention showed a surprisingly high clinical potential in the anxious MDD group which needs further confirmation compared vs treatment-as-usual. Future studies need to investigate whether self-blame-selective rSATL-SC connectivity changes are irrelevant in anxious MDD, which could explain their response being better to the psychological intervention without interfering neurofeedback.","/content/10.1101/19004309v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004309v1.full.pdf","2019-08-09","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Time to death and its Predictors among Adult TB/HIV Co-Infected Patients in Mizan Tepi University Teaching Hospital, South West Ethiopia","Abstract
Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV) co-infection represents a complex pathogenic scenario with synergistic effect and leads to about 300,000 HIV-associated TB deaths in the world in 2017. Despite this burden of death, time to death and its predictors among TB-HIV co-infected patient was not adequately studied; and the existing evidences are inconsistent. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine time to death and identify its predictors among adult TB/HIV co-infected patients.
Method: Retrospective cohort study was conducted by reviewing registers of randomly selected 364 TB/HIV co-infected patients enrolled in health care from July 2, 2007 up to July 1, 2017 at Mizan Tepi University Teaching Hospital. The hospital was located in Bench Maji Zone, South West Ethiopia. Data were collected from March 1 through 31, 2018, entered to Epi data 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 21. Each patient was followed from date of TB treatment initiation till death, loss to follow up and treatment completed. On the other hand, events other than death were considered as censored. After checking the proportional hazard model assumption, Cox-regression was used to identify the predictors. In bivariable analyses, P-value=0.25 was used to identify candidate variables for multivariable analysis. The 95% CI of hazard ratio (HR) with respective P-value <0.05 was used to declare significance in the final model.
Result: All the 364 patients were followed for 1,654 person months. There were 83 (22.8%) deaths and most 38 (45.8%) were occurring within the first two months of anti-TB treatment initiation. The overall incidence rate and median survival time were 5.02 per 100 person months (95% CI: 4.05, 6.22) and 10 months respectively. Statistically significant better survival was observed among patients: with CD4 = 200 cells/mm3 (P<0.001), who had a history of cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) use (P<0.001), who disclose their HIV status (P<0.001) and with working functional status (P<0.001). Not using CPT (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] =1.72; P=0.023), bedridden functional status (AHR=2.55; P=0.007), not disclosing HIV status (AHR=4.03; P<0.001) and CD4 < 200 cells/mm3 (AHR=6.05; P<0.001) were predictors of time to death among TB/HIV co-infected patients.
Conclusion: The median survival time was 10 months and poor survival was associated with low CD4 count, not using CPT, not disclosing HIV status and having bedridden functional status. Close monitoring of bedridden and low CD4 count patients, prompt CPT initiation and encouraging HIV status disclosure are recommended.

"Enhanced mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR+) in episodic migraine: a randomized clinical trial with MRI outcomes","Background: Mindfulness interventions have not been rigorously evaluated in episodic migraine. 

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of an enhanced mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR+) versus  stress management for headache (SMH).

Design, Setting, Participants: Randomized, assessor-blind, clinical trial of 98 adults with episodic migraine recruited at a single academic center comparing MBSR+ (n=50) to SMH (n=48). (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02133209)

Intervention: MBSR+ and SMH were delivered weekly by group for 8 weeks, then bi-weekly for another 8 weeks.

Measurements: The primary outcome was reduction in headache days from baseline to 20 weeks. MRI outcomes included activity of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cognitive task network during cognitive challenge, resting state connectivity of right dorsal anterior insula (daINS) to DLPFC and cognitive task network, and gray matter volume of DLPFC, daINS, and anterior midcingulate. Secondary outcomes were headache-related disability, pain severity, response to treatment, migraine days, and MRI whole-brain analyses. 

Results: Reduction in headache days from baseline to 20 weeks was greater for MBSR+ (7.8 [95%CI, 6.9-8.8] to 4.6 [95%CI, 3.7-5.6]) than for SMH (7.7 [95%CI 6.7-8.7] to 6.0 [95%CI, 4.9-7.0]) (P=0.04).  52% of the MBSR+ group showed a response to treatment (50% reduction in headache days) compared with 23% in the SMH group (P=0.004). Reduction in headache-related disability was greater for MBSR+ (59.6 [95%CI, 57.9-61.3] to 54.6 [95%CI, 52.9-56.4]) than SMH (59.6 [95%CI, 57.7-61.5] to 57.5 [95%CI, 55.5-59.4]) (P=0.02). There were no differences in clinical outcomes at 52 weeks or MRI outcomes at 20 weeks, although changes related to cognitive networks with MBSR+ were observed.

Limitations:  A single site and likely self-selection bias.

Conclusions: MBSR+ is an effective treatment option for episodic migraine.","/content/10.1101/19004069v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004069v1.full.pdf","2019-08-06","Pain Medicine

"Investigating the attitudes of Canadian paramedic students towards homelessness.","Introduction: When paramedics are dispatched, it is expected that every patient receives the same level of care regardless of variable factors. Homelessness is a growing social issue across Canada that is particularly prevalent in urban areas. The quality of healthcare delivered to individuals experiencing homelessness may be influenced by negative attitudes held by healthcare professionals. There is an absence of literature quantifying the perspectives of paramedics towards homelessness; therefore, the focus of this study was to identify the attitudes of paramedic students towards homelessness and to continue the conversation in regards to the evolving educational needs of paramedic students.

Methods: This study employed a longitudinal design of a convenience sample of first year paramedic students in a college program in Ontario, Canada. The Health Professional's Attitude Towards the Homeless Inventory (HPATHI) was distributed to participants before and after placement and clinical exposure. The questionnaire includes 19 statements which participants respond to on a Likert scale. Mean scores were calculated, and statements were categorized into attitudes, interest, and confidence. Data were collected post-placement on interactions with persons experiencing homelessness.

Results: A total of 52 first year paramedic students completed the HPATHI pre-placement and 47 completed the questionnaire post-placement. Mean scores for attitudes (pre 3.64, SD 0.49; post 3.85, SD 0.38, p=0.032), interest (pre 3.91, SD 0.40; post 3.84, SD 0.39,p=0.51) and confidence (pre 4.02, SD 0.50; post 3.71, SD 0.67, p=0.004) were largely positive, but there was a demonstrated decreasing trend in confidence with, and interest in, working with those experiencing homelessness. Participants reported an average of 60 hours of placement, during which 15 participants (32%) reported interactions with people experiencing homelessness.

Conclusion: First year paramedic students demonstrate overall positive attitudes towards those experiencing homelessness, and the mean score for attitudes improved over the surveys. However, there were demonstrable decreases in confidence and interest over time, which may be related to the type and frequency of interactions during clinical placement. Paramedic education programs may benefit from the inclusion of focused education on homelessness, specific clinical experiences, and education related to social determinants of health.","/content/10.1101/19003483v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003483v1.full.pdf","2019-08-06","Public and Global Health

"Mental Health in UK Biobank Revised","This paper corrects and updates a paper published in BJPsych Open 2018 Mental Health in UK Biobank (https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2018.12) that was voluntarily retracted following the finding of errors in the coding of the variable for alcohol use disorder. Notably, the percentage of participants reaching threshold for alcohol use disorder on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Tool increased from 7% to 21%. This paper includes corrections and updates. 

Background: UK Biobank is a well-characterised cohort of over 500,000 participants that offers unique opportunities to investigate multiple diseases and risk factors. An online mental health questionnaire completed by UK Biobank participants expands the potential for research into mental disorders. 

Methods: An expert working group designed the questionnaire, using established measures where possible, and consulting with a service user group regarding acceptability. Operational criteria were agreed for defining likely disorder and risk states, including lifetime depression, mania/hypomania, generalised anxiety disorder, unusual experiences and self-harm, and current post-traumatic stress and alcohol use disorders. 

Results: 157,366 completed online questionnaires were available by August 2017. Comparison of self-reported diagnosed mental disorder with a contemporary study shows a similar prevalence, despite respondents being of higher average socioeconomic status. Lifetime depression was the most common finding in 24% of participants (37,434), with current alcohol use disorder criteria met by 21% (32,602), while other criteria were met by less than 8% of the participants. There was extensive comorbidity among the syndromes. Mental disorders were associated with a high neuroticism score, adverse life events and long-term illness; addiction and bipolar affective disorder in particular were associated with measures of deprivation. 

Conclusions: The questionnaire represents a very large mental health survey in itself, and the results presented here show high face validity, although caution is needed due to selection bias. Built into UK Biobank, these data intersect with other health data to offer unparalleled potential for crosscutting biomedical research involving mental health.","/content/10.1101/19001214v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001214v1.full.pdf","2019-08-05","Epidemiology

"Improvements in the incidence and survival of cancer and cardiovascular but not infectious disease have driven recent mortality improvements in Scotland: nationwide cohort study of linked hospital admission and death records 2001-2016","Objectives: To identify the causes and future trends underpinning improvements in life expectancy in Scotland and quantify the relative contributions of disease incidence and survival.

Design: Population-based study.

Setting: Linked secondary care and mortality records across Scotland.

Participants: 1,967,130 individuals born between 1905 and 1965, and resident in Scotland throughout 2001-2016.

Main outcome measures: Hospital admission rates and survival in the five years following admission for 28 diseases, stratified by sex and socioeconomic status.

Results: The five hospital admission diagnoses associated with the greatest burden of death were ""Influenza and pneumonia"", ""Symptoms and signs involving the circulatory and respiratory systems"", ""Malignant neoplasm of respiratory and intrathoracic organs"", ""Symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen"", and ""General symptoms and signs"". Using trends in disease, we modelled a mean mortality hazard ratio of 0.737 (95% CI 0.730-0.745) across decades of birth, equivalent to a life extension of ~3 years per decade. This improvement was 61% (30%-93%) accounted for by improvements in disease survival after hospitalisation (principally cancer) with the remainder accounted for by a fall in hospitalisation incidence (principally heart disease and cancer). In contrast, deteriorations in the incidence and survival of infectious diseases reduced mortality improvements by 9% (~3.3 months per decade). Overall, health-driven mortality improvements were slightly greater for men than women (due to greater falls in disease incidence), and generally similar across socioeconomic deciles. We project mortality improvements will continue over the next decade but will slow down by 21% because much of the progress in disease survival has already been achieved.

Conclusion: Morbidity improvements broadly explain observed improvements in overall mortality, with progress on the prevention and treatment of heart disease and cancer making the most significant contributions. The gaps between men and women's morbidity and mortality are closing, but the gap between socioeconomic groups is not. A slowing trend in improvements in morbidity may explain the stalling in improvements of period life expectancies observed in recent studies in the UK. However, our modelled slowing of improvements could be offset if we achieve even faster improvements in the major diseases contributing to the burden of death, or if we improve prevention and survival of diseases which have deteriorated recently, such as infectious disease, in the future.","/content/10.1101/19003012v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003012v1.full.pdf","2019-08-05","Public and Global Health

"Meat intake and cancer risk: prospective analyses in UK Biobank","Background: Red and processed meat has been consistently associated with risk for colorectal cancer, but evidence for other cancer sites is limited and few studies have examined the association between poultry intake and cancer risk. We examined associations between total meat, red meat, processed meat and poultry intake and incidence for 20 common cancer sites.
Methods and Findings: We analysed data from 475,023 participants (54% women) in UK Biobank. Participants were aged 37 73 years and cancer free at baseline. Information on meat consumption was based on a touchscreen questionnaire completed at baseline covering type and frequency of meat intake. Diet intake was re-measured a minimum of three times in a subsample (15%) using a web-based 24h dietary recall questionnaire. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association between baseline meat intake and cancer incidence. Trends in risk across baseline meat intake categories were calculated by assigning a mean value to each category using estimates from the re-measured meat intakes. During a mean follow-up of 6.9 years, 28,955 participants were diagnosed with a malignant cancer. Total, red and processed meat intakes were each positively associated with risk of colorectal cancer (e.g. hazard ratio (HR) per 70 g/day higher intake of red and processed meat combined 1.31, 95%-confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.52). Red meat intake was positively associated with breast cancer (HR per 50 g/day higher intake 1.12, 1.01-1.24) and prostate cancer (1.15, 1.03-1.29). Poultry intake was positively associated with risk for cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues (HR per 30g/day higher intake 1.16, 1.03-1.32). Only the associations with colorectal cancer were robust to Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Study limitations include unrepresentativeness of the study sample for the UK population, low case numbers for less common cancers and the possibility of residual confounding. 
Conclusions: Higher intakes of red and processed meat were associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer. The observed positive associations of red meat consumption with breast and prostate cancer, and poultry intake with cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues, require further investigation.","/content/10.1101/19003822v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003822v1.full.pdf","2019-08-02","Epidemiology

"Role of miRNAs induced by oxidized low-density lipoproteins in coronary artery disease: the REGICOR Study.","Aims: Current risk prediction tools are not accurate enough to identify most individuals at high coronary risk. On the other hand, oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDLs) and miRNAs are actively involved in atherosclerosis. Our aim was to examine the association of ox-LDL-induced miRNAs with coronary artery disease (CAD), and to assess their predictive capacity of future CAD.   
Methods and results: Human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells were treated with oxidized or native LDLs (nLDL), and their miRNA expression was measured with the miRNA 4.0 array, and analyzed with moderated t-tests. Differently expressed miRNAs and others known to be associated with CAD, were examined in serum samples of 500 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients and 500 healthy controls, and baseline serum of 117 incident CAD cases and c 485 randomly-selected cohort participants (case-cohort). Both were developed within the REGICOR AMI Registry and population cohorts from Girona. miRNAs expression in serum was measured with custom OpenArray plates, and analyzed with fold change (age and sex-paired case-control) and survival models (case-cohort). Improvement in discrimination and reclassification by miRNAs was assessed.
Twenty-one miRNAs were up- or down-regulated with ox-LDL in cell cultures. One of them, 1 (has-miR-122-5p, fold change=4.85) was upregulated in AMI cases. Of the 28 known CAD-associated miRNAs, 11 were upregulated in AMI cases, and 1 (hsa-miR-143-3p, hazard ratio=0.56 [0.38-0.82]) was associated with CAD incidence and improved reclassification. 
Conclusion: We identified 2 novel miRNAs associated with ox-LDLs (hsa-miR-193b-5p and hsa-miR-1229-5p), and 1 miRNA that improved reclassification of healthy individuals (hsa-miR-143-3p).","/content/10.1101/19003749v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003749v1.full.pdf","2019-08-02","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Characteristics of Patients that Substitute Medical Cannabis for Alcohol","Aims. A substitution effect occurs when patients substitute Medical Cannabis (MC) for another drug. Over three-quarters (76.7%) of New England dispensary members reported reducing their use of opioids and two-fifths (42.0%) decreased their use of alcohol after starting MC (Piper et al. 2017). The objective of this exploratory study was to identify any factors which differentiate alcohol substituters from those that do not modify their alcohol use after starting MC (non-substituters).

Methods. Among dispensary patients (N=1,477), over two-thirds with chronic pain, that completed an online survey, 7.4% indicated that they regularly consumed alcohol. Comparisons were made to identify any demographic or health history characteristics which differentiated alcohol substituters (N=47) from non-substituters (N=65). Respondents selected from among a list of 37 diseases and health conditions (e.g. diabetes, sleep disorders) and the total number was calculated. 

Results. Substituters and non-substituters were indistinguishable in terms of sex, age, or prior drug history. Substituters were significantly more likely to be employed (68.1%) than non-substituters (51.1%). Substituters also reported having significantly more health conditions and diseases (3.3+2.0) than non-substituters (2.4+1.4). 

Conclusions. This small study offers some insights into the profile of patients whose self-reported alcohol intake decreased following initiation of MC. Alcohol substituters had more other health conditions but also were more likely to be employed which may indicate that they fit a social drinker profile. Additional prospective or controlled research into the alcohol substitution effect following MC with a sample with more advanced alcohol misuse may be warranted.

"Eating behavior trajectories in the first ten years of life and their relationship with BMI","Background: Child eating behaviors (EBs) are highly heterogeneous and their longitudinal impact on childhood weight is unclear. The objective of this study was to characterize EBs during the first ten years of life and evaluate associations with BMI at age 11 years.
Method: Data were parental reports of EBs from birth to age 10 years and standardized body mass index (zBMI) at age 11 years (n=12,048) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Latent class growth analysis was used to derive latent classes of over-, under-, and fussy eating. Linear regression models for zBMI at 11 years on each set of classes were fitted to assess associations with EBs trajectories. 
Results: We identified four classes of overeating; low stable (70%), low transient (15%), late increasing (11%), and early increasing (6%). The early increasing class was associated with higher zBMI (boys: ÃŸ=0.83, 95%CI:0.65, 1.02; girls: ÃŸ=1.1; 0.92, 1.28) compared to low stable. Six classes were found for undereating; low stable (25%), low transient (37%), low decreasing (21%), high transient (11%), high decreasing (4%), and high stable (2%). The latter was associated with lower zBMI (boys: ÃŸ=-0.79; -1.15, -0.42; girls: ÃŸ=-0.76; -1.06, -0.45). Six classes were found for fussy eating; low stable (23%), low transient (15%), low increasing (28%), high decreasing (14%), low increasing (13%), high stable (8%). The high stable class was associated with lower zBMI (boys: ÃŸ =-0.49; -0.68 -0.30; girls: ÃŸ =-0.35; -0.52, -0.18). 
Conclusions: Early increasing overeating during childhood is associated with higher zBMI at age 11. High persistent levels of undereating and fussy eating are associated with lower zBMI. Longitudinal trajectories of EBs may help identify children potentially at risk of adverse weight outcomes.","/content/10.1101/19003665v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003665v1.full.pdf","2019-08-02","Pediatrics

"A phenome-wide analysis of short- and long-run disease incidence following Recurrent Pregnancy Loss using data from a 39-year period","Background: Pregnancy loss is one of the most frequent pregnancy complications. It is unclear how recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) impacts disease risk later in life and if later disease risk is different in women with or without a live birth prior to RPL (primary vs. secondary RPL). We sought to investigate if women have an increased risk of disease following RPL, and if there was a difference between primary and secondary RPL.
Methods: Using population-wide health care registry databases from Denmark we identified a cohort of 1,370,896 women between 12 and 40 years in the period January 1, 1977, to October 5, 2016 who had been pregnant. Each woman was followed on average for 15.8 years. Of these, 10,691 (0.77%) women fulfilled the criteria for RPL (50.0% had primary RPL). Relative Risk Ratios (RR) were calculated in a phenome-wide manner for diagnoses with a cumulative incidence proportion =0.1% in women with RPL. Diagnoses related to assessment and diagnosis of RPL and those appearing later in life were separated using a Mixture Model.
Results: In the full cohort of pregnant women, 0.77% (10,691)  fulfilled the criteria for RPL (50.0% primary RPL). Compared to women without RPL, primary RPL increased the risk of subsequent cardiovascular disorders, including atherosclerosis (RR=2.45, 1.65-3.51 95% Uncertainty Interval (UI)), cerebral infarction (RR=1.87, 1.43-2.4 95% UI), heart failure (RR=1.97, 1.44-2.63 95% UI), and pulmonary embolism (RR=1.82, 1.32-2.46 95% UI). Women with secondary RPL had an increased risk of obstetric complications, e.g. placenta previa (RR=3.76, 2.9-4.8 95% UI), premature rupture of membrane (RR=2.55, 2.21-2.91 95% UI), intrapartum hemorrhage (RR=2.8, 1.77-4.31 95% UI), gestational hypertension (RR=2.2, 1.67-2.87 95% UI), and puerperal sepsis (RR=2.54, 1.8-3.5 95% UI). We also noticed associations to autoimmune, respiratory, gastro-intestinal and mental disorders in both subtypes. 
Conclusion: Our findings show that RPL is a risk factor for a spectrum of disorders. This can in part be due to increased screening following RPL, but it also suggests that RPL may directly influence or share etiology with a number of diseases later in life. Research into the pathophysiology of both pregnancy loss and later diseases merits further investigation.","/content/10.1101/19003558v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003558v1.full.pdf","2019-08-02","Obstetrics and Gynecology

"Effectiveness of four oral antifungal drugs (fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, terbinafine) in current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India: A randomized pragmatic trial","Background: Dermatophyte infections have undergone unprecedented changes in India in recent past. Clinical trials comparing effectiveness of 4 main oral antifungal drugs are not available. We tested effectiveness of oral fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine in chronic and chronic-relapsing tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei. 
Methods: Two hundred microscopy confirmed patients were allocated to 4 groups, fluconazole (5mg/kg/day), griseofulvin (10 mg/kg/day), itraconazole (5mg/kg/day), and terbinafine (7.5mg/kg/day), by concealed block randomization and treated for 8 weeks or cure. Effectiveness was calculated based on intention to treat analysis. 
Results: At 4 weeks, 4, 1, 2, and 4 patients were cured with fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine, respectively (P=0.417). At 8 weeks, 21 (42%), 7 (14%), 33 (66%) and 14 (28%) patients were cured, respectively (P=0.000); itraconazole was superior to fluconazole, griseofulvin and terbinafine (P=0.016). Relapse rates after 4 and 8 weeks of cure in different groups were similar. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNT) (versus griseofulvin), calculated based on cure rates at 8 weeks, for itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine were 2, 4 and 8, respectively.
Conclusion: In view of cure rates and NNT, itraconazole is the most effective drug, followed by fluconazole (daily), terbinafine and then griseofulvin, in chronic and chronic-relapsing dermatophytosis in India.","/content/10.1101/19003541v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003541v1.full.pdf","2019-08-02","Dermatology

"Smoking, DNA methylation and lung function: a Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate causal relationships","Whether smoking-associated DNA methylation has a causal effect on lung function has not been thoroughly evaluated. We investigated the causal effects of 474 smoking-associated CpGs on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using methylation quantitative trait loci and genome-wide association data for FEV1. We found evidence of a possible causal effect for DNA methylation on FEV1 at 18 CpGs (p<1.2x10-4). Replication analysis supported a causal effect at three CpGs (cg21201401 (ZGPAT), cg19758448 (PGAP3) and cg12616487 (AHNAK) (p<0.0028). DNA methylation did not clearly mediate the effect of smoking on FEV1, although DNA methylation at some sites may influence lung function via effects on smoking. Using multiple-trait colocalization, we found evidence of shared causal variants between lung function, gene expression and DNA methylation. Findings highlight potential therapeutic targets for improving lung function and possibly smoking cessation, although large, tissue-specific datasets are required to confirm these results.","/content/10.1101/19003335v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003335v1.full.pdf","2019-08-02","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Early detection of molecular disease progression by whole-genome circulating tumor DNA in advanced solid tumors","Purpose: Treatment response assessment for patients with advanced solid tumors is complex and existing methods of assessment require greater precision for early disease assessment. Current guidelines rely on imaging, which has limitations such as the long time required before treatment effectiveness can be determined. Serial changes in whole-genome (WG) circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were used to detect disease progression early in the treatment course. 

Methods: 97 patients with advanced cancer were enrolled, and blood was collected before and after initiation of a new treatment. Plasma cell-free DNA libraries were prepared for either WG or WG bisulfite sequencing. Longitudinal changes in the fraction of ctDNA were quantified to identify molecular progression or response in a binary manner. Study endpoints were agreement with first follow-up imaging (FUI) and stratification of progression-free survival (PFS).

Results: Patients with early molecular progression had shorter PFS (n=14; median 62d) compared to others (n=78; median 263d, HR 12.6 [95% confidence interval 5.8-27.3], log-rank P<10-10, 5 excluded from analysis). All cases with molecular progression were confirmed by FUI and molecular progression preceded FUI by a median of 40d. Sensitivity for the assay in identifying clinical progression was 54%, median 24d into treatment and specificity was 100%.

Conclusions: Molecular progression, based on ctDNA data, detected disease progression for cases on treatment with high specificity approximately 6 weeks before follow-up imaging. This technology may enable early course change to a potentially effective therapy, avoiding side effects and cost associated with cycles of ineffective treatment.","/content/10.1101/19002550v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002550v2.full.pdf","2019-08-02","Oncology

"Nonlinear biomarker interactions in conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's disease","The multi-faceted nature of Alzheimer's disease means that multiple biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-beta, tau, brain atrophy) can contribute to the prediction of clinical outcomes. Machine learning methods are a powerful way to identify the best approach to this prediction. However, it has been difficult previously to model nonlinear interactions between biomarkers in the context of predictive models. This is important as the mechanisms relating these biomarkers to the disease are inter-related and nonlinear interactions occur. Here, we used Gaussian Processes to model nonlinear interactions when combining biomarkers to predict Alzheimer's disease conversion in 48 mild cognitive impairment participants who progressed to Alzheimer's disease and 158 stable (over three years) people with mild cognitive impairment. Measures included: demographics, APOE4 genotype, CSF (amyloid-beta-42, total tau, phosphorylated tau), neuroimaging markers of amyloid-beta deposition ([18F]florbetapir) or neurodegeneration (hippocampal volume, brain-age). We examined: (i) the independent value each biomarker has in predicting conversion; and (ii) whether modelling nonlinear interactions between biomarkers improved prediction performance.
Despite relatively high correlations between different biomarkers, our results showed that each measured added complementary information when predicting conversion to Alzheimer's disease. A linear model predicting MCI group (stable versus progressive) explained over half the variance (R2 = 0.51, P < 0.001); the strongest independently-contributing biomarker was hippocampal volume (R2 = 0.13). Next, we compared the sensitivity of different models to progressive MCI: independent biomarker models, additive models (with no interaction terms), nonlinear interaction models. We observed a significant improvement (P < 0.001) for various two-way interaction models, with the best performing model including an interaction between amyloid-beta-PET and P-tau, while accounting for hippocampal volume (sensitivity = 0.77).
Our results showed that closely-related biomarkers still contribute uniquely to the prediction of conversion, supporting the continued use of comprehensive biological assessments. A number of interactions between biomarkers were implicated in the prediction of Alzheimer's disease conversion. For example, the interaction between hippocampal atrophy and amyloid-deposition influences progression to Alzheimer's disease over and above their independent contributions. Importantly, nonlinear interaction modelling shows that although for some patients adding additional biomarkers may add little value (i.e., when hippocampal volume is high), but for others (i.e., with low hippocampal volume) further invasive and expensive testing is warranted. Our Gaussian Processes framework enables visual examination of these nonlinear interactions, allowing projection of individual patients into biomarker 'space', providing a way to make personalised healthcare decisions or stratify subsets of patients for recruitment into trials of neuroprotective interventions.","/content/10.1101/19002378v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002378v2.full.pdf","2019-08-02","Neurology

"Population Structure Drives Differential Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Colonization Dynamics","Background: Using a model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) within an intensive care unit (ICU), we explore how differing hospital population structures impact these infection dynamics.
Methods: Using a stochastic compartmental model of an 18-bed ICU, we compared the rates of MRSA acquisition across three potential population structures: a Single Staff Type (SST) model with nurses and physicians as a single staff type, a model with separate staff types for nurses and physicians (Nurse-MD model), and a Metapopulation model where each nurse was assigned a group of patients. By varying the proportion of time spent with the assigned patient group (<U+03B3>) within the Metapopulation model, we explored whether simpler models may be acceptable approximations to more realistic patient-healthcare staff contact patterns. 
Results: The SST, Nurse-MD, and Metapopulation models had a mean annual number of cumulative MRSA acquisitions of 40.6, 32.2 and 19.6 respectively. All models were sensitive to the same parameters in the same direction, although the Metapopulation model was less sensitive. The number of acquisitions varied non-linearly by values of <U+03B3>, with values below 0.40 resembling the Nurse-MD model, while values above that converged toward the metapopulation structure. 
Discussion: The population structure of a modeled hospital has considerable impact on model results, with the SST model having more than double the acquisition rate of the more structured Metapopulation model. While the direction of parameter sensitivity remained the same, the magnitude of these differences varied, producing different infection rates across relatively similar populations. The non-linearity of the model's response to differing values of <U+03B3> suggests only a narrow space of relatively dispersed nursing assignments where simple model approximations are appropriate.
Conclusion: Simplifying assumptions around how a hospital population is modeled, especially assuming random mixing, may overestimate infection rates and the impact of interventions.","/content/10.1101/19002402v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002402v2.full.pdf","2019-08-02","Epidemiology

"Medication errors during simulated paediatric resuscitations: a prospective, observational human reliability analysis","Introduction: Medication errors during paediatric resuscitation are thought to be common. However, there is little evidence about the individual process steps that contribute to such medication errors in this context.
Objectives: To describe the incidence, nature and severity of medication errors in simulated paediatric resuscitations, and to employ human reliability analysis to understand the contributory role of individual process step discrepancies to these errors.
Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of simulated resuscitations subject to video micro-analysis, identification of medication errors, severity assessment and human reliability analysis in a large English teaching hospital. Fifteen resuscitation teams of two doctors and two nurses each conducted one of two simulated paediatric resuscitation scenarios. 
Results: At least one medication error was observed in every simulated case, and a large magnitude or clinically significant error in 11 of 15 cases. Medication errors were observed in 29% of 180 simulated medication administrations, 40% of which considered to be moderate or severe. These errors were the result of 884 observed discrepancies at a number of steps in the drug ordering, preparation and administration stages of medication use, 8% of which made a major contribution to a resultant medication error. Most errors were introduced by discrepancies during drug preparation and administration. 
Conclusions: Medication errors were common with a considerable proportion likely to result in patient harm. There is an urgent need to optimise existing systems and to commission research into new approaches to increase the reliability of human interactions during administration of medication in the paediatric emergency setting.","/content/10.1101/19001016v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001016v2.full.pdf","2019-08-02","Pediatrics

"Changing trends in proportional incidence and 5-year net survival of screened and nonscreened invasive breast cancers among women in England","Background: Uptake of breast cancer screening has been decreasing in England since 2007, and may increase proportional incidence of nonscreened cancers. However, recent trends in proportional incidence and net-survivals of screened and nonscreened breast cancers are unclear.
Methods: We extracted population-based proportional incidence and age-standardized 5-year net-survivals from Public Health England, for English women with invasive breast cancer diagnosed during 1995-2011 (linked to death certificates, followed through 2016). Piecewise log-linear models with change-point/joinpoint were used to estimate temporal trends. We conducted a quasi-experimental study to test the hypothesis that the trend-change year of proportional incidence coincided with that of 5-year net-survival. 
Results:  Among 254,063 women in England with invasive breast cancer diagnosed during 1995-2011, there was downward-to-upward trend-change in proportional incidence of nonscreened breast cancers (annual percent change[APC]=5.6 after 2007 versus APC=-3.5 before 2007, P<0.001) in diagnosis-year 2007, when steeper upward-trend in age-standardized 5-year net survival started (APC=5.7 after 2007/2008 versus APC=0.3 before 2007/2008, P<0.001).. Net-survival difference of screened versus nonscreened cancers also significantly narrowed (18% in 2007/2008 versus 5% in 2011). Similar associations were found in all strata of race, cancer stage, grade and histology, except in Black patients or patients with stage I, stage III, or grade I cancer.  
Conclusions: The downward-to-upward trend-change in proportional incidence of nonscreened breast cancers is associated with steeper upward-trend in age-standardized 5-year net survival among English women in recent years. Survival benefits of breast cancer screening appear decreasing in recent years. The data support reduction of breast cancer screening in some patients.","/content/10.1101/19003202v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003202v1.full.pdf","2019-08-01","Primary Care Research

"Incubation periods impact the spatial predictability of outbreaks: analysis of cholera and Ebola outbreaks in Sierra Leone","Forecasting the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases during an outbreak is an important component of epidemic response. However, it remains challenging both methodologically and with respect to data requirements as disease spread is influenced by numerous factors, including the pathogen's underlying transmission parameters and epidemiological dynamics, social networks and population connectivity, and environmental conditions. Here, using data from Sierra Leone we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of recent cholera and Ebola outbreaks and compare and contrast the spread of these two pathogens in the same population. We develop a simulation model of the spatial spread of an epidemic in order to examine the impact of a pathogen's incubation period on the dynamics of spread and the predictability of outbreaks. We find that differences in the incubation period alone can determine the limits of predictability for diseases with different natural history, both empirically and in our simulations. Our results show that diseases with longer incubation periods, such as Ebola, where infected individuals can travel further before becoming infectious, result in more long-distance sparking events and less predictable disease trajectories, as compared to the more predictable wave-like spread of diseases with shorter incubation periods, such as cholera.","/content/10.1101/19003525v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003525v1.full.pdf","2019-08-01","Epidemiology

"Patient Benefit and Risk in Anticancer Drug Development: A Systematic Review of the Ixabepilone Trial Portfolio","OBJECTIVE: To describe the patient burden and benefit, and the dynamics of trial success in the development of ixabepilone, a drug that was approved in the US but not in Europe.
DATA SOURCES: Trials were captured by searching Embase and MEDLINE on July 27, 2015.
STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion: 1) primary trial reports, 2) interventional trials, 3) human subjects, 4) phase 1 to phase 3, 5) trials of ixabepilone in monotherapy or combination therapy of 6) pre-licensure cancer indications. Exclusion: 1) secondary reports, 2) interim results, 3) meta-analyses, 4) retrospective/observational studies, 5) laboratory analyses (ex vivo tissues), 6) reviews, 7) letters, editorials, guidelines, interviews, abstract-only and poster presentations.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were independently double-extracted and differences between coders were reconciled by discussion.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We measured risk using the number of drug-related adverse events that were grade 3 or higher, benefit by objective response rate and trial outcomes by whether studies met their primary endpoint with acceptable safety.
RESULTS: We identified 39 publications of ixabepilone monotherapy and 23 primary publications of combination therapy, representing 5615 patients and 1598 patient-years of involvement over 11 years and involving 17 different malignancies. In total, 830 patients receiving ixabepilone experienced objective tumour response (16%, 95% CI 12.5%-20.1%), and 74 died from drug-related toxicites (2.2%, 95% CI 1.6%-2.9%). Responding indications and combinations were identified very quickly; thereafter, the search for additional responding indications or combinations did not lead to labelling additions. A total of 11 ""uninformative"" trials were found, representing 27% of studies testing efficacy, 208 grade 3-4 events and 226 patient-years of involvement (21% and 26% of the portfolio total, respectively). After the European Medicines Agency rejected ixabepilone for licensing, all further trial activity involving ixabepilone was pursued outside of Europe.
DISCUSSION: Risk/benefit for patients who enrolled in trials of non-approved indications of ixabepilone did not improve over the course of the drug's development. Clinical value was discovered very quickly; however, a large fraction of trials were uninformative.","/content/10.1101/19003467v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003467v1.full.pdf","2019-08-01","Medical Ethics

"Comparative functional survival and equivalent annual cost of three long lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) products in Tanzania","Almost 1.2 billion long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been procured for malaria control. Institutional buyers often assume that World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified LLINs are functionally identical with a three-year lifespan. We measured the lifespans of three LLIN products, and calculated their cost-per-year of functional life, through a  randomised double-blinded prospective evaluation among 3,420 study households in Tanzania using WHO-recommended methods. Primary outcome was LLIN functional survival (LLINs present in serviceable condition). Secondary outcomes were 1) bioefficacy and chemical content (residual insecticidal activity) and 2) protective efficacy for volunteers sleeping under LLINs (bite reduction and mosquitoes killed).  LLIN median functional survival was significantly different: 2.0 years for Olyset, 2.5 years for PermaNet and 2.6 years for NetProtect. Functional survival was affected by accumulation of holes resulting in users discarding nets. Protective efficacy also significantly differed between products as they aged. The longer-lived nets were 20% cheaper than the shorter-lived product.","/content/10.1101/19002212v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002212v1.full.pdf","2019-08-01","Public and Global Health

"Toric Intraocular Lens Implantation in Cataract Patients with Corneal Opacity.","Aims: To evaluate the effect of toric intraocular lens implantation in cataract patient with corneal opacity and high astigmatism. 
Methods: 31 eyes of 31 patients who underwent cataract surgery with toric intraocular lens implantation were included. All patients had corneal opacity with regular astigmatism. Preoperative total corneal astigmatism was determined considering posterior astigmatism using a rotating Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam: Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany). At 2 months after toric intraocular lens implantation, we evaluated residual astigmatism, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).
Results: Postoperative UCVA and BCVA (0.30 Â± 0.17, 0.22 Â± 0.16LogMAR) statistically improved compared to preoperative UCVA and BCVA (1.2 Â± 0.34, 1.1 Â± 0.30LogMAR, respectively) (P<0.01). Postoperative residual refractive astigmatism (1.2 Â± 0.35D) was statistically reduced compared to preoperative refractive astigmatism (2.4 Â± 0.65D) (P<0.05). Preoperative and postoperative total corneal astigmatism values were not statistically different. All cases achieved visual acuity were as good as or better than that preoperatively. The percentage of corneal opacity covering pupillary area had significant negative correlation with postoperative UCVA and BCVA (logMAR) (R=-0.88 P<0.00001 and R=-0.87 P<0.00001, respectively)
Conclusion: Toric intraocular lens implantation can improve UCVA, BCVA, and refractive astigmatism in cataract patient with corneal opacity. The percentage of central corneal opacity covering pupillary area is the major prognostic factor for postoperative visual improvement. Therefore, toric intraocular lens implantation should be considered for cataract patients who have corneal opacity with high astigmatism.","/content/10.1101/19003319v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003319v1.full.pdf","2019-07-30","Ophthalmology

"Individuals with Parkinson's Disease Retain Spatiotemporal Gait Control With Music and Metronome Cues","Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is marked by a loss of motor automaticity, resulting in decreased control of step length during gait. Rhythmic auditory cues (metronomes or music) may enhance automaticity by adjusting cadence. Both metronomes and music may offer distinct advantages, but prior attempts at quantifying their influence on spatiotemporal aspects of gait have been confounded by altered gait speeds from overground walking. We hypothesized that when gait speed is fixed, individuals with PD would experience difficulty in modifying cadence due to the concomitant requirement to alter step length, with greater changes noted with metronomes compared to music cues. 
Research Question: Can a metronome or music promote spatiotemporal adjustments when decoupled from changes in gait speed in individuals with PD?
Methods: 21 participants with PD were instructed to time their steps to a metronome and music cues (at 85%, 100%, and 115% of overground cadence) during treadmill walking. We calculated cadence, cadence accuracy, and step length during each cue condition and an uncued control condition. We compared the various cue frequencies and auditory modalities.
Results: At fixed gait speeds, participants were able to increase and decrease cadence in response to auditory cues. Music and metronome cues produced comparable results in cadence manipulation with greater cadence errors noted at slower intended frequencies. Nevertheless, the induced cadence changes created a concomitant alteration in step length, with music and metronomes producing comparable changes. Notably, longer step lengths were induced with both music and metronome during slow frequency cueing. 
Significance: This important change conflicts with conventional prescriptive approaches, which advocate for faster cue frequencies, if applied on a treadmill. The music and metronome cues produced comparable changes to gait, suggesting that either cue may be effective at overcoming the shortened step lengths during treadmill walking if slower frequencies are used.","/content/10.1101/19003269v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003269v1.full.pdf","2019-07-30","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Association of Kras mutation with tumor deposit status and overall survival of colorectal cancer","Background The recent staging manual upstages Node-negative tumor-deposit positive colorectal cancer (CRC) from N0 to N1c category, while the development of tumor-deposit presence is poorly understood. Meanwhile, Kras mutation is associated with progression of CRC, but its link to tumor-deposit status is unclear.
Method: This retrospective cohort study included the patients with incidental CRC diagnosed during 2010-2014 in the National Cancer Database and recorded statuses of Kras and tumor deposit. We conducted multivariable logistic regression and Cox regression analyses to investigate the factors associated with tumor-deposit status and overall-survival, respectively.
Results A total of 48,200 CRC patients with Kras status were included in the study (25,407 [52.7%] men, 25,648[46.8%] <65 years old, 18 381 [38.1%] with Kras mutation). Adjusted for microsatellite instability, age, pathologic stage and tumor grade, Kras mutation (versus wild-type) was associated with tumor-deposit presence (n=15,229, odds ratio=1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20). Kras mutation was also independently linked to a worse overall survival of CRC patients regardless of tumor-deposit status (n=8,110, adjusted Hazard ratio=1.40, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.79 for CRC with tumor deposits, and n=2,618, adjusted HR=1.63, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.28 for CRC without), but a better survival in CRC with no known/applicable tumor-deposit status (n=457, adjusted Hazard ratio =0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.95). 

Conclusion Kras mutation is independently associated with tumor-deposit presence, and a worse overall survival of CRC with or without tumor-deposit. Therefore, it may play a role in the development of tumor deposits and serve as a target for CRC treatment.","/content/10.1101/19003210v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003210v1.full.pdf","2019-07-30","Pathology

"FDA oversight of NSIGHT genomic research: the need for an integrated systems approach to regulation","The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded the Newborn Sequencing In Genomic medicine and public HealTh (NSIGHT) Consortium to investigate the implications, challenges and opportunities associated with the possible use of genomic sequence information in the newborn period. Following announcement of the NSIGHT awardees in 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) contacted investigators and requested that pre-submissions to investigational device exemptions (IDE) be submitted for the use of genomic sequencing under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) part 812. IDE regulation permits clinical investigation of medical devices that have not been approved by the FDA. To our knowledge, this marked the first time the FDA determined that NIH-funded clinical genomic research projects are subject to IDE regulation. Here we review the history of and rationale behind FDA oversight of clinical research and the NSIGHT Consortiums experiences in navigating the IDE process. Overall, NSIGHT investigators found that FDAs application of existing IDE regulations and medical device definitions aligned imprecisely with the aims of publicly funded exploratory clinical research protocols. IDE risk assessments by the FDA were similar to, but distinct from, protocol risk assessments conducted by local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), and had the potential to reflect novel oversight of emerging genomic technologies. However, the pre-IDE and IDE process delayed the start of NSIGHT research studies by an average of 10 months, and significantly limited the scope of investigation in two of the four NIH approved projects. Based on the experience of the NSIGHT Consortium, we conclude that policies and practices governing the development and use of novel genomic technologies in clinical research urgently need clarification in order to mitigate potentially conflicting or redundant oversight by IRBs, NIH, FDA, and state authorities.","/content/10.1101/19001370v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001370v1.full.pdf","2019-07-30","Public and Global Health

"Contrasting Evidence to Reimbursement Reality for Off-label use (OLU) of Drug Treatments in Cancer Care - Rationale and Design of the CEIT-OLU-project","Background: Off-label drug use (OLU) reflects a perceived unmet medical need, which is common in oncology. Cancer drugs are often highly expensive and their reimbursement is a challenge for many health care systems. OLU is frequently regulated by reimbursement restrictions. For evidence-based health care, treatment ought to be reimbursed if there is sufficient clinical evidence for treatment benefit independently of patient factors not related to the treatment indication. However, little is known about the reality of OLU reimbursement and its association with the underlying clinical evidence. Here we aim to investigate the relationship of reimbursement decisions with the underlying clinical evidence.
Methods/ Design: We extract patient characteristics and details on treatment and reimbursement of cancer drugs from over 3000 patients treated in three Swiss hospitals. We systematically search for clinical trial evidence on benefits associated with OLU in the most common indications. We will describe the prevalence of OLU in Switzerland and its reimbursement in cancer care, and use multivariable logistic regression techniques to investigate the association of approval/rejection of a reimbursement requests to the evidence on treatment effects and to further factors, including type of drug, molecular predictive markers and the health insurer.
Discussion: Our study will provide a systematic overview and assessment of OLU and its reimbursement reality in Switzerland. We may provide a better understanding of the access to cancer care that is regulated by health insurers and we hope to identify factors that determine the level of evidence-based cancer care in a highly diverse Western health care system.","/content/10.1101/19003152v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003152v1.full.pdf","2019-07-29","Public and Global Health

"A study of knowledge, experience and beliefs about hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in south western Uganda","Introduction: United Nations sustainable development goals aim for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, leading to efforts to upscale the availability and accessibility of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination, diagnosis and treatment globally. However, a variety of societal factors, including beliefs, traditions, and stigma, can be a major obstacle to all of these interventions. We therefore set out to investigate how HBV is understood and described in communities in Uganda, and whether there is evidence of potential stigma.
Method: We carried out a qualitative formative study in two sites in South Western Uganda: a village in Kalungu district (site A) and an area on the outskirts of Masaka town (site B). We undertook a rapid assessment to investigate how adults describe HBV infection and their perceptions about the infection. We collected data by conducting a transect walk, observations, community group discussions, and in-depth interviews, sampling a total of 131 individuals. We used inductive content analysis to extract key themes associated with HBV. 
Results: There is no specific word for HBV infection in local languages, and knowledge about this infection is varied. While some individuals were completely unfamiliar with HBV infection, some had heard of HBV. Radio was a common source of information. There was awareness of HBV as a cause of liver disease, limited knowledge regarding the cause, mode of transmission and treatment. Stigma in HBV may be rare in this community due to limited understanding and experience of HBV. 
Conclusion: There is an ongoing need to improve awareness and understanding of HBV in this community. Careful dissemination of accurate information is required to promote acceptance of interventions for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.","/content/10.1101/19003129v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003129v1.full.pdf","2019-07-29","Public and Global Health

"The ansa subthalamica: a neglected fiber tract","Background: The pallidofugal pathways are classically subdivided into ansa lenticularis, lenticular fasciculus, and subthalamic fasciculus. In addition to these three subsystems, we characterize an anatomical structure that connects the antero-medial pole of the subthalamic nucleus to the ventral portions of the pallidum, both related to limbic processing of information. This bundle has been previously considered to form a part of the ansa lenticularis, however, it shows striking differences on histology and MRI features compared to the ansa lenticularis, and therefore we suggest to denominate it ansa subthalamica. Objectives: To describe the ansa subthalamica as a different structure than the ansa lenticularis, that can be recognized by different methods (histology, high-field MRI and connectome tractography), including current 3T clinical imaging. Methods: A complete human brain was histologically processed and submitted to registration procedures to correct for tissue deformations and normalization to MNI space. Coordinates of histological structures were then comparable to high-field (7T) post-mortem and in vivo MRIs, 13 pre-operative 3T imaging of parkinsonian patients and normative connectome tractography. Mean intensity gray values for different structures were measured in Susceptibility-Weighted Images. Results: It was possible to characterize this structure with different methods and there was a significant difference in signal intensity in the ansa subthalamica (hypointense), compared to the ansa lenticularis (hyperintense). Conclusions: The ansa subhtalamica may represent the anatomical pathway that connects limbic regions of the STN and pallidum, and should be investigated as a possible substrate for limbic effects of stereotactic surgery of the subthalamic region.","/content/10.1101/19002352v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002352v1.full.pdf","2019-07-29","Neurology

"Considerations in the deployment of novel universal vaccines against epidemic and pandemic influenza","There is increasing interest in the development of new, 'universal' influenza vaccines (UIV) that - unlike current vaccines - are effective against a broad range of seasonal influenza strains, as well as against novel pandemic viruses. Even where these vaccines do not block infection, they can moderate clinical severity, reducing morbidity and mortality while potentially also reducing opportunities for transmission. Previous modelling studies have illustrated the potential epidemiological benefits of UIVs, including their potential to mitigate pandemic burden. However, these new vaccines could shape population immunity in complex ways. Here, using mathematical models of influenza transmission, we illustrate two types of unintended consequences that could arise from their future deployment. First, by reducing the amount of infection-induced immunity in a population without fully replacing it, a seasonal UIV programme may permit larger pandemics than in the absence of vaccination. Second, the more successful a future UIV programme is in reducing transmission of seasonal influenza, the more vulnerable the population could become to the emergence of a vaccine-escape variant. These risks could be mitigated by optimal deployment of any future UIV vaccine: namely, the use of a combined vaccine formulation (incorporating conventional as well as multiple universal antigenic targets), and by achieving sufficient population coverage to compensate for reductions in infection-induced immunity. As early candidates of UIVs approach advanced clinical trials, there is a need to monitor their characteristics in such a way that is focused on their potential impact. This work offers a first step in this direction.","/content/10.1101/19002485v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002485v1.full.pdf","2019-07-29","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Microbiota and Health Study: a prospective cohort of respiratory and diarrheal infections and associated risk factors in Bangladeshi infants under two years","Background:
Early childhood respiratory and diarrheal infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is a need to further assess the epidemiology through prospective and community-based studies to gain key insights that could inform preventative measures to reduce the risk of infectious disease in this vulnerable population. We aimed to analyze the burden and determinants of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhea episodes affecting infants during their first 2 years of life with state-of-the-art molecular technologies.  
Methods:
The ARI and diarrhea episodes were prospectively collected in a community-based, longitudinal cohort of infants (n=267) from birth to 2 years of life in Bangladesh. Women were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. Demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental information on the households was recorded. Nasopharyngeal and fecal samples were collected during regular scheduled visits from mother-infant pairs, and also from the infants during unscheduled visits for reported illnesses. New generation sequencing methods will be utilized to determine microbiota composition and function, supplemented by the state-of-the-art multiplex molecular detection technology for a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens. 
Discussion:
This study sought to assess the epidemiology of both respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses during the first 2 years of life in children from a peri-urban community of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Characteristics of the mothers, as well as birth characteristics of infants enrolled in the Microbiota and Health Study are presented here. We will determine any potential association between microbiota composition and the abovementioned illnesses, and also examine the influence of known and hypothesized risk factors on the occurrence of infections. Such putative factors include environmental, socioeconomic, maternal, clinical, and selected genetic factors, namely the variation of the fucosyltransferase genes (FUT2 and FUT3) of mothers and infants. This study will add to current knowledge about these early childhood infectious diseases, and will provide data to generate hypotheses for the development of nutritional approaches to be used as prevention strategies.
Trial registration: The study was retrospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02361164 (February 11, 2015).","/content/10.1101/19000505v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000505v1.full.pdf","2019-07-29","Pediatrics

"The Human Leukocyte Antigen Locus and Susceptibility to Rheumatic Heart Disease in South Asians and Europeans","Background. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Several reports have linked the disease to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus but with negligible consistency.
Methods. We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of susceptibility to RHD in 1163 South Asians (672 cases; 491 controls) recruited in India and Fiji. We analysed directly obtained and imputed genotypes, and followed-up associated loci in 1459 Europeans (150 cases; 1309 controls) from the UK Biobank study. For fine-mapping, we used HLA imputation to define classical alleles and amino acid polymorphisms.
Results. A single signal situated in the HLA class III region reached genome-wide significance in the South Asians, and replicated in the Europeans (rs201026476; combined odds ratio 1.81, 95% confidence intervals 1.51-2.18, P=3.48x10-10). While the signal fine-mapped to specific amino acid polymorphisms within HLA-DQB1 and HLA-B, with conditioning, the lead class III variant remained associated with susceptibility (P=3.34x10-4), suggesting an independent effect. 
Conclusions. A complex HLA signal, likely comprising at least two underlying causal variants, strongly associates with susceptibility to RHD in South Asians and Europeans. Crucially, the involvement of the class III region may partly explain the previous inconsistency, while offering important new insight into pathogenesis.","/content/10.1101/19003160v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003160v1.full.pdf","2019-07-26","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"A single-blinded randomized crossover trial comparing peer-to-peer and standard instruction on airway management skill training","Background Peer-to-peer teaching, which is an alternative to standard teaching (by expert instructors), has the potential to emphasize student self-learning and reduce the cost and workload of the instructor. Self-instruction videos with peer feedback are highlighted in many medical and nursing school curricula. 
Objective To evaluate whether peer to peer instruction supported by a structured curriculum and video exemplars is not inferior to standard instructor-led teaching in basic airway management skill, knowledge, and confidence attainment.
Method This single blinded randomized crossover trial was conducted with a sample of novice nursing students. Data was collected through the pre- to post- knowledge and confidence assessments. The students were randomly assigned to two crossover groups. Each student learned basic airway management skills through both methods. The students performances were recorded in every session with recordings reviewed by blinded expert instructors.
Results The study included 48 participants, who were assigned into both the expert instruction group and peer-to-peer group through computer generated randomization. The skill rating scores of the peer-to-peer group were not inferior to the standard teaching. With further analysis, we noted that the peer-to-peer group scores had significantly higher scores demonstrating a large effect size (Cohens d of 1.07 (p-value 0.002) for oropharyngeal airway insertion, 1.14 (p-value <0.001) for nasopharyngeal airway insertion and 0.81 (p-value 0.003) for bag mask ventilation). There was no significant difference between pre- and post- knowledge scores across groups (p-value of 0.13 and 0.22 respectively). Participants in both groups reported higher confidence after learning. However, the difference was not statistically significant. 
Conclusions Undergraduate nursing students trained in basic airway management skills by peer-to-peer instruction and a structured curriculum did not show inferior scores compared to the students who were trained by expert instructors. There was no significant difference in the knowledge and confidence levels between the groups.","/content/10.1101/19001768v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001768v1.full.pdf","2019-07-26","Medical Education

"Esophageal Cooling For Protection During Left Atrial Ablation: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis","Objective: We sought to perform a meta-analysis of existing studies evaluating esophageal cooling via direct liquid instillation for the reduction of thermal injury.  

Methods: We reviewed Medline for existing studies involving esophageal cooling for protection of thermal injury during RF ablation.  A meta-analysis was then performed using random effects model to calculate estimated effect size with 95% confidence intervals, with outcome of esophageal lesions, stratified by severity, as determined by post-procedure endoscopy.  

Results: A total of 9 studies were identified and reviewed.  After excluding pre-clinical and mathematical model studies, 3 were included in the meta-analysis, totaling 494 patients.  Esophageal cooling showed a tendency to shift lesion severity downward, such that total lesions did not show a statistically significant change (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.38). For high grade lesions, a significant OR of 0.39 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.89) in favor of esophageal cooling was found, suggesting that esophageal cooling, even utilizing a low-capacity thermal extraction technique, reduces lesion severity from RF ablation.   

Conclusions: Esophageal cooling reduces lesion severity encountered during RF ablation, even when using relatively low heat extraction methods such as direct instillation of cold liquid.  Further investigation of this approach is warranted.","/content/10.1101/19003228v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003228v1.full.pdf","2019-07-26","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Designing a text messaging program to increase adherence to medication for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease","Background: Cardiovascular medication for secondary prevention has been shown to be effective. However, cardiovascular patients have poor medication adherence, the consequences of which include premature death, recurrence risk, hospitalization, and high financial cost for the healthcare system. Behavioral interventions based on text messaging technology are a promising strategy to improving adherence in medications. In low-middle income settings there is no high-quality evidence of a behavioral program delivered by SMS; hence we describe the development, message content, and the program design of the intervention for improving adherence to cardiovascular medication. 
Methods: We used the model reported by Abroms and colleagues for developing and evaluating text messages-based interventions. This model describes a process in which the intervention created is based on theory and evidence, the target audience is involved to ensure the intervention is engaging and useful, and there is a focus on implementation from the outset.
Results: Our main result was the design of the program, which consisted of a twelve-month structured intervention based on Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. We wrote and validated clusters of texts messages targeting each stage of the model. Each message went through an examination process including the evaluation of former cardiovascular patients, experts and the team research personnel. Another important result was an understanding of patients perceptions of their experience of cardiovascular disease, barriers to accessing healthcare in Colombia and the use of mobile technology for health. 
Conclusions: An SMS intervention has the potential to be an acceptable and effective way of improving adherence to medication in patients with cardiovascular disease. This paper describes the development and content of one such intervention.","/content/10.1101/19002683v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002683v1.full.pdf","2019-07-26","Public and Global Health

"Alcohol causes an increased risk of head and neck but not breast cancer in individuals from the UK Biobank study: A Mendelian randomisation analysis.","Alcohol intake and the risk of various types of cancers have been previously correlated. Correlation though does not always mean that a causal relationship between the two is present. Excessive alcohol consumption is also correlated with other lifestyle factors and behaviours, such as smoking and increased adiposity, that also affect the risk of cancer and make the identification and estimation of the causal effect of alcohol on cancer difficult. Here, using individual level data for 322,193 individuals from the UK Biobank, we report the observational and causal effects of alcohol consumption on types of cancer previously suggested as correlated to alcohol. Alcohol was observationally associated with cancers of the lower digestive system, head and neck and breast cancer. No associations were observed when we considered those keeping alcohol consumption below the recommended threshold of 14 units/week. When Mendelian randomisation was used to assess the causal effect of alcohol on cancer, we found that increasing alcohol consumption, especially above the recommended level, was causal to head and neck cancers but not breast cancer. Our results where replicated using a two sample MR method and data from the much larger COGS genome wide analysis of breast cancer. We conclude that alcohol is causally related to head and neck cancers, especially cancer of larynx, but the observed association with breast cancer are likely due to confounding. The suggested threshold of 14 units/week appears suitable to manage the risk of cancer due to alcohol.","/content/10.1101/19002832v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002832v1.full.pdf","2019-07-26","Epidemiology

"fMRI as an outcome measure in clinical trials: A systematic review in clinicaltrials.gov","Background:  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is quickly becoming a significant outcome measure for clinical trials and as more than one thousand trials with fMRI as an outcome measure were registered in clinicaltrials.gov at the time of writing this article. However, 93% of these registered trials are still not completed with published results and there is no picture available about methodological dimensions of these ongoing trials with fMRI as an outcome measure. Methods: We collected trials that use fMRI as an outcome measure by searching ""fMRI"" in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry on October 13 2018 and reviewing each trial's record entry. Eligible trials' characteristics were extracted and summarized. Results: In total, 1386 clinical trials were identified that reported fMRI in their outcome measures with fMRI as the only primary outcome in 33% of them. 82% of fMRI trials were started after 2011. The most frequent intervention was drug (29%). 57% of trials had parallel assignment design and 20% were designed for cross over assignment.  For task-based fMRI, cognitive systems (46%) based on RDoC was the most frequent domain of tasks, followed by positive valence systems (19%), systems for social processing (10%), and sensorimotor systems (5%). Less than one-third of trials (28%) registered at least one region of interest for their analysis. Food cue reactivity task, pain perception task, n-back task, and monetary incentive delay task were recruited in more than 25 registered trials. Conclusion: The number of fMRI trials (fMRI as an outcome measure) with both task and rest protocols is growing rapidly. Different RDoC domains are covered by various tasks in fMRI trials. However, our study suggests the need of greater harmony and better standardization for registration of fMRI details on both methods and analysis which would allow for more effective comparison across studies in systematic reviews and also help the validation of results towards having fMRI as a biomarker in the future.","/content/10.1101/19002972v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002972v1.full.pdf","2019-07-25","Radiology and Imaging

"Quantification of Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography in Age and Age-related Macular Degeneration using Vessel Density analysis","Purpose 
To determine whether vessel density (VD) as measured by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) provide insights into retinal and choriocapillaris vascular changes with ageing and intermediate dry age related macular degeneration (AMD).
Methods 
Seventy-five participants were recruited into three cohorts; young healthy (YH) group, old healthy (OH) and those at high-risk for exudative AMD. Raw OCT and OCT-A data from TOPCON DRI OCT Triton were exported using Topcon IMAGENET 6.0 software, and 3D datasets were analysed to determine retinal thickness and vessel density. 
Results 
Central macular thickness measurements revealed a trend of overall retinal thinning with increasing age. VD through the full thickness of the retina was highest in ETDRS sector 4 (the inferior macula) in all the cohorts. Mean VD was significantly higher in the deep capillary plexus than the superficial capillary plexus in all ETDRS sectors in all cohorts but there was no significant difference noted between groups. Choriocapillaris VD was significantly lower in all ETDRS sectors in the in the AMD group compared with the YH and the OH groups. 
Conclusions 
Retinal vessel density maps, derived from the retinal plexi are not reliable biomarkers for assessing the ageing macular. Our non-proprietary analysis of the vascular density of the choriocapillaris revealed a significant drop off of VD with age and disease but further work is required to corroborate this finding. If repeatable, choriocapillaris VD may provide a non-invasive biomarker of healthy ageing and disease.","/content/10.1101/19003053v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003053v1.full.pdf","2019-07-25","Ophthalmology

"The Paradox of Female Obesity in Low and Lower-Middle Income Countries","Setting: Obesity, once considered an epidemic of the developed world, is now becoming an even more prominent problem than underweight in low and lower-middle income countries (LLMICs). Ample literature has shown that as the income of a country increases, the burden of obesity shifts from the rich to the poor. Many studies have explored the effects of various social determinants of health on obesity, but few have studied the association between obesity and education. Additionally, while some data exists on the association in men, there have been limited comprehensive studies focusing on the relationship in the female population of LLMICs. 
Objective: Globally, adult females have a higher prevalence of obesity and the obesity shift occurs more quickly for women than for men. We aim to address this disparity and explore the association of education and obesity in women.
Design: In this cross-sectional study, we used a multi-national and multi-year database from the publicly available Demographic and Health Surveys program with data from 34 LLMICs. 
Results: Our age-adjusted analysis shows that women in LLMICs with higher education have a significantly greater prevalence of obesity than women with no education. We analyzed this phenomenon by individual nations, continents, and income classifications. Educated women living in low income countries are 5.12 times more likely to be obese than uneducated women (APR, 95% CI=4.75, 5.32) and 3.48 times (APR, 95% CI=3.37, 3.60) more likely in lower-middle income countries. 
Conclusion: These findings highlight a need for more studies and policy attention focusing on female education levels to understand, predict, and prevent obesity in LLMICs.","/content/10.1101/19003004v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003004v1.full.pdf","2019-07-25","Epidemiology

"Excess weight mediates changes in HDL pool that reduce cholesterol efflux capacity and increase antioxidant activity","Objective: Obesity-related decline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) functions such as cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) has supported the notion that this lipoprotein dysfunction may contribute for atherogenesis among obese patients. Besides, potentially other HDL protective actions may be affected with weight gain and these changes may occur even before the obesity range. 
Methods: Lipid profile, body mass index (BMI), biochemical measurements, and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) were obtained in this cross-sectional study with 899 asymptomatic individuals. HDL functions were measured in a subgroup (n=101). 
Results: Individuals with increased HDL-C had an attenuated increase in cIMT with elevation of BMI. CEC, HDL-C, HDL size and HDL-antioxidant activity were negatively associated with cIMT. BMI was inversely associated with HDL-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation and CEC, but surprisingly it was directly associated with the antioxidant activity. Thus, even in non-obese, non-diabetic individuals, increased BMI is associated with a wide change in protective functions of HDL, reducing CEC and increasing antioxidant activity. In these subjects, decreased HDL concentration, size or function are related to increased atherosclerotic burden.
Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that in non-obese, non-diabetic individuals, the increasing values of BMI are associated with impaired protective functions of HDL and concomitant increase in atherosclerotic burden.","/content/10.1101/19002899v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002899v1.full.pdf","2019-07-25","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Multidimensional factors predicting exclusive breastfeeding in Ethiopia: evidence from a meta-analysis of studies in the past 10 years","Background: In Ethiopia, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is 60.1%, which is lower than the national Health Sector Transformation Plan 2016-2020, National Nutrition Program 2016-2020 and WHO global target. This may be attributed to multidimensional factors. 
Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association between EBF and educational status, household income, marital status, media exposure, and parity in Ethiopia.
Methods: Databases used were PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, CINAHL and WHO Global health library, and key terms were searched using interactive searching syntax. It was also supplemented by manual searching. Observational studies published between September 2000 and March 2019 were included. The methodological quality of studies was examined using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cross-sectional studies. Data were extracted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) data extraction tool. To obtain the pooled odds ratio (OR), extracted data were fitted in a random-effects meta-analysis model. Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using Cochran Q test, t2, and I2 statistics. Additional analysis conducted includes Jackknife sensitivity analysis, cumulative meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis. 
Results: Out of 553 studies retrieved, 31 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Almost all studies were conducted on mothers with newborn less than 23 months. Maternal educational status (OR = 1.39; p = 0.03; 95% CI = 1.03 - 1.89; I2 = 86.11%), household income (OR = 1.27; p = 0.02; 95% CI = 1.05 - 1.55; I2 = 60.9%) and marital status (OR = 1.39; p = 0.02; 95% CI = 1.05 - 1.83; I2 = 76.96%) were found to be significantly associated with EBF. We also observed an inverse dose-response relationship of EBF with educational status and income. Significant association was not observed between EBF and parity, media exposure and paternal educational status. 
Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we depicted the relevant effect of maternal education, income, and marital status on EBF. Therefore, multifaceted, effective, and evidence-based efforts are needed to increase national breastfeeding rates in Ethiopia.","/content/10.1101/19002857v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002857v1.full.pdf","2019-07-24","Pediatrics

"Hospital Resource Utilization in Epilepsy: Disparities in Rural vs Urban Care","Objective: This study assessed differences in resource utilization during epilepsy and seizure related hospitalizations in urban versus rural environments, to identify potential disparities in care for people living with epilepsy in rural communities.
Methods: A 10 year (2001 to 2011) state-wide hospital discharge database was used. Cost, length of stay, illness severity, and procedure use were compared between urban facilities, rural facilities, and epilepsy centers. Comparison across three separate years helped to identify differences between facility type as well as to assess practices changes within facilities over time.
Results: Average total charges between the three types of facilities was significantly different, with epilepsy centers having the highest average charge per patient, followed by urban and rural facilities (corrected p-values < 0.001). Illness severity was similar between the three groups, with the exception that epilepsy centers had a higher proportion of major severity cases. Length of stay remained fairly consistent across all three years for epilepsy centers (mean: 4.75 days), while decreasing for urban facilities (means: 4.39 to 3.72) and ultimately decreasing for rural facilities (mean: 3.31 to 3.09). Rates of procedure utilization revealed CT scan use persisted longer at rural facilities compared to urban facilities, while EEG and vEEG was low at rural facilities. vEEG was relatively restricted to epilepsy centers and had an initial substantial rise in use over the years and was associated with corresponding greater surgical procedure rates.
Significance: This study indicates a measurable difference between epilepsy centers, urban facilities, and rural facilities in cost and procedure utilization while caring for patients during epilepsy- and seizure-related hospitalizations. If these conclusions are valid, they support that persons living with epilepsy who live in rural communities and utilize these services receive care that is considered suboptimal when compared to urban centers or epilepsy centers.","/content/10.1101/19002766v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002766v1.full.pdf","2019-07-24","Neurology

"Use of undetectable viral load to improve population-based survey estimates of known HIV-positive status and antiretroviral treatment coverage in Kenya","Introduction: Underreporting of prior HIV diagnosis and antiretroviral therapy (ART) use based on self-report is well-documented in national surveys. Antiretroviral (ARV) testing has been used to improve survey estimates, by reclassifying respondents with ARVs detected in blood as previously-diagnosed and on ART. Viral load testing, which is more affordable and more routinely available than ARV testing, is also an indicator of ART use. We examined the impact of adjusting estimated knowledge of HIV-positive status and antiretroviral therapy (ART) use based on self-report with biomarkers for antiretroviral drug detection and undetectable viral load (UVL). 
Methods: We reclassified HIV-positive participants aged 15-64 years in the 2012 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS) that were unaware of their HIV-positive status by self-report as aware and on ART if either ARVs were detected or viral load was undetectable (<550 copies/mL) on dried blood spots.  We compared self-report to adjustments for ARV measurement, UVL, or both.  We calculated measures of accuracy for UVL and UVL & ARV-adjusted versions of knowledge of status and ART use versus ARV-adjusted self-report as a reference standard.
Results: Among 235 of 648 HIV-positive respondents with UVL, self-reported status was: 65 unaware (28.7%), 25 aware, not on ART (9.9%) and 145 aware, on ART (61.3%). Treatment coverage among all HIV-positive respondents increased from 31.8% for self-report to 42.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 37.4-47.8] based on ARV detection alone, to 42.8% (95% CI 37.9-47.8) when ARV-adjusted, 46.2% (95% CI 41.3-51.1) when UVL-adjusted and 48.8% (95% CI 43.9-53.8) when adjusted for ARV and UVL. Awareness of positive status increased from 46.9% for self-report to 56.2% (95% CI 50.7-61.6) when ARV-adjusted, 57.5% (95% CI 51.9-63.0) when UVL-adjusted, and 59.8% (95% CI 54.2-65.1) when adjusted for ARV and UVL. Sensitivity and specificity of UVL-adjusted known HIV-positive status were 95.8% and 91.3%, and of UVL-adjusted ART use were 93.0% and 88.8% respectively, versus ARV-adjusted self-report.
Conclusions: Undetectable viral load may be a useful adjunct or alternative to ARV detection for adjusting knowledge of status and ART use indicators in population-based surveys.","/content/10.1101/19002592v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002592v1.full.pdf","2019-07-24","HIV/AIDS

"Metagenomic identification of severe pneumonia pathogens with rapid Nanopore sequencing in mechanically-ventilated patients.","Background: Metagenomic sequencing of respiratory microbial communities for etiologic pathogen identification in pneumonia may help overcome the limitations of current culture-based methods. We examined the feasibility and clinical validity of rapid-turnaround metagenomics with Nanopore sequencing of respiratory samples for severe pneumonia diagnosis.
Methods and Findings: We conducted a case-control study of mechanically-ventilated patients with pneumonia (nine culture-positive and five culture-negative) and without pneumonia (eight controls). We collected endotracheal aspirate samples (ETAs) and applied a microbial DNA enrichment method prior to performing metagenomic sequencing with the Oxford Nanopore MinION device. We compared Nanopore results against clinical microbiologic cultures and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In nine culture-positive cases, Nanopore revealed communities with low alpha diversity and high abundance of the bacterial (n=8) or fungal (n=1) species isolated by clinical cultures. In four culture-positive cases with resistant organisms, Nanopore detected antibiotic resistance genes corresponding to the phenotypic resistance identified by clinical antibiograms. In culture-negative pneumonia, Nanopore revealed probable bacterial pathogens in 1/5 cases and airway colonization by Candida species in 3/5 cases. In controls, Nanopore showed high abundance of oral bacteria in 5/8 subjects, and identified colonizing respiratory pathogens in the three other subjects. Nanopore and 16S sequencing showed excellent concordance for the most abundant bacterial taxa. 
Conclusion: We demonstrated technical feasibility and proof-of-concept clinical validity of Nanopore metagenomics for severe pneumonia diagnosis, with striking concordance with positive microbiologic cultures and clinically actionable information offered from the sequencing profiles of culture-negative samples. Prospective studies with real-time metagenomics are warranted to examine the impact on antimicrobial decision-making and clinical outcomes.","/content/10.1101/19002774v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002774v1.full.pdf","2019-07-24","Respiratory Medicine

"Associations between respiratory health outcomes and coal mine fire PM2.5 smoke exposure: a cross-sectional study","Rational
In 2014, local wildfires ignited a fire in the Morwell open cut coal mine, in south-eastern Australia, which burned for six weeks. Limited research was available regarding the respiratory health effects of coal mine fire-related PM2.5 smoke exposure. 
Objective
This study examined associations between self-reported respiratory outcomes in adults and mine fire-related PM2.5 smoke exposure.
Participants
Eligible participants were adult residents of Morwell, identified using the Victorian electoral roll. 
Main outcome measures
Self-reported data were collected as part of the Hazelwood Health Study Adult Survey.
Mine fire-related PM2.5 concentrations were retrospectively modelled by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Oceans & Atmosphere Flagship. Personalised mean 24-h and peak 12-h mine fire-related PM2.5 exposures were estimated for each participant. Data were analysed by multivariate logistic regression.
Results
There was some evidence of a dose-response relationship between respiratory outcomes and mine fire PM2.5 concentrations. Chronic cough was associated with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.13 (95% Confidence Interval 1.03 to 1.23; p-value 0.007) per 10 Âµg/m3 increment in mean PM2.5 and 1.07 (1.02 to 1.12; 0.004) per 100 Âµg/m3 increment in peak PM2.5. Current wheeze was associated with peak PM2.5, OR=1.06 (1.02 to 1.11; 0.004) and chronic phlegm with mean PM2.5 OR=1.10 (1.00 to 1.20; 0.052). Males, participants 18-64 years and those residing in homes constructed from non-brick/concrete materials or homes with tin/metal roofs had higher estimated ORs.
Conclusions
These findings contribute to the formation of public health policy responses in the event of future major pollution episodes.","/content/10.1101/19002808v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002808v1.full.pdf","2019-07-23","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Teacher-rated aggression and co-occurring problems and behaviors among schoolchildren: A comparison of four population-based European cohorts","Non-pathological levels of children's co-occurring externalizing/internalizing problems in the school setting are not well characterized. We assessed associations between aggressive behavior and co-occurring externalizing/internalizing problems among schoolchildren in 39,936 teacher ratings from 4 population-based cohorts (FinnTwin12 from Finland, Generation R and the Netherlands Twin Register from the Netherlands, and the Twins Early Development Study from the UK). Correlations of aggressive behavior were high with other externalizing problems (0.47-0.80) and lower with internalizing problems (0.02-0.39). A negative association was seen with prosocial behavior, ranging -0.33 to -0.54. Although the mean levels of aggressive behavior differed significantly by gender, the correlations of aggressive behavior with co-occurring behaviors were notably more similar between the genders (e.g., aggressive-hyperactivity correlations: 0.51-0.75 boys, 0.47-0.70 girls). Comparisons are also discussed with respect to age, instrument/cohort, and parental ratings. These population-based European observations highlight the complexity of aggressive behavior at school, and can assist in creating appropriate interventions.","/content/10.1101/19002576v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002576v1.full.pdf","2019-07-23","Epidemiology

"Show solidarity with the Congolese people in the 10th Ebola outbreak declared a health emergency of international concern: understand a qualitative study of variables of hospital activities on infection control practices in Kinshasa city","Health workers play an important role during epidemics, but there is limited research on hospital activities on infection control practices in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and how health workers can cope during a probable health epidemic in Kinshasa city. The determinants of the current Ebola Virus Disease in the geographical distribution remain poorly understood. The World Health Organization's Health Regulation Committee decided on Wednesday July 17th, 2019 to declare the Ebola haemorrhagic fever epidemic in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri as a health emergency of international concern. The country struggles to control it against a backdrop of a health system that is already overburdened. To test the influence of the challenges of a contamination in the context of an Ebola outbreak that may face health workers and their coping strategies in thirteen hospitals of reference in Kinshasa, we conducted a survey hoping to educate or remember good practices for health workers in Kinshasa that is also available for health workers in the East Area of the country in which the ongoing Ebola outbreak progress is spreading (North Kivu and Ituri). For the ongoing outbreak, we obtained data from the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo where cases are classified as suspected, probable, or confirmed using national case definitions.  We found that the ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has similar epidemiological features to previous Ebola virus disease outbreak in Sierra Leone that was well described. For the qualitative study about the biosecurity in thirteen hospitals of reference in Kinshasa, we found that the Bondeko-Ngaliema Monkole group has occupied the first rank, while the group Kintambo-King Baudouin-Ndjili-Makala occupied the other end of the scale; the other health facilities occupied an intermediate position. Among the 7 hospitals which were placed at the top of this classification of biosecurity, 5 were massively subsidized by international NGO, which explains to a great extent their performances in one hand, another hand finding its explanation in the quality of their management. It is the case of Bondeko, Monkole, Kalembe-Lembe, St Joseph and Kingasani 2.

"The Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study: online recruitment into the largest recontactable study of depression and anxiety","Background: Anxiety and depression are common, debilitating and costly. These disorders are influenced by multiple risk factors, from genes to psychological vulnerabilities and environmental stressors but research is hampered by a lack of sufficiently large comprehensive studies. We are recruiting 40,000 individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety, with broad assessment of risks to facilitate future research.
Methods: The Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study (www.gladstudy.org.uk) recruits individuals with depression or anxiety into the NIHR Mental Health BioResource. Participants invited to join the study (via media campaigns) provide demographic, environmental and genetic data, and consent for medical record linkage and recontact.
Results: Online recruitment was effective; 41,892 consented and 26,877 participants completed the questionnaire by July 2019. Participants' questionnaire data identified very high rates recurrent depression, severe anxiety and comorbidity. Participants reported high rates of treatment receipt. The age profile of sample is biased toward young adults, with higher recruitment of females and the better educated, especially at younger ages.  
Discussion: This paper describes the study methodology and descriptive data for GLAD, which represents a large, recontactable resource that will enable future research into risks, outcomes and treatment for anxiety and depression.","/content/10.1101/19002022v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002022v2.full.pdf","2019-07-22","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Research transparency promotion by surgical journals publishing randomised controlled trials: a survey","Objective: To describe the surgical journal position statement on data-sharing policies (primary objective) and to describe the other features of their research transparency promotion.
Methods: Only SURGICAL journals with an impact factor superior to 2 (Web of Science) were eligible for the study.  They were not included if there were no explicit instructions for clinical trial publication in the instructions for authors and if there were no RCT published between January 2016 and January 2019. The primary outcome was the existence of a data-sharing policy in the instructions for authors. Details on research transparency promotion were also collected, namely the existence of a prospective registration of clinical trials requirement policy; a COIs disclosure requirement and a specific reference to reporting guidelines such as CONSORT for RCT. 
Results: Among the 87 surgical journals eligible, 82 (94%) were included in the analysis: 67 (77%) had explicit instructions for RCT and of the remaining, 15 (17.2%) had published at least one RCT between 2016-2019. The median impact factor was 2.98 [IQR=2.48-3.77] and in 2016 and 2017, the journals published a median of 11.5 RCT [IQR=5-20.75]. Data-sharing statement instructions (primary outcome) were ICMJE-compliant in four cases (4.88%), weaker in 45.12% (n=37) and inexistent in 50% (n=41) of the journals. As for data-sharing statements, no association was found between journal characteristics and the existence of data-sharing policies (ICMJE-compliant or weaker). A prospective registration of clinical trials requirement was associated with ICMJE allusion or affiliation and higher impact factors. Journals with specific RCT instructions in their OIA and journals referenced on the ICMJE website more frequently mandated the use of CONSORT guidelines. 
Conclusion: Research transparency promotion is still limited in surgical journals.  Uniformization of journal requirements vis-a-vis ICMJE guidelines could be a first step forward for research transparency promotion in surgery.","/content/10.1101/19002386v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002386v1.full.pdf","2019-07-22","Surgery

"Mechanisms of Arrhythmogenicity in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Insight from Noninvasive Electrocardiographic Imaging","Background: Mechanisms of arrhythmogenicity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are not well understood. We hypothesized that HCM is characterized by the specific electrophysiological substrate as compared to patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), or healthy individuals.
Methods: We conducted a prospective case-control study. HCM patients at high risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) (n=10; age 61 Â± 9 y; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 60 Â± 9%) and three control groups (Healthy individuals (n=10; age 28 Â± 6 y; LVEF>70%), ICM patients with LV hypertrophy (LVH) and known VT (n=10; age 64 Â± 9 y; LVEF 31 Â± 15%), and ICM patients with LVH, and no known VT (n=10; age 70 Â± 7y; LVEF 46 Â± 16%). All participants underwent 12-lead ECG, cardiac CT or MRI, and 128-electrode body surface mapping (BioSemi ActiveTwo, Netherlands). Non-invasive voltage and activation maps were reconstructed using the open-source SCIRun (University of Utah) inverse problem-solving environment.
Results: In endocardial basal anterior segment, HCM patients had the slowest ventricular conduction [54.3 Â± 8.6 vs. 64.0 Â± 8.0 (ICM with VT) vs. 63.3 Â± 5.4 (ICM no VT) vs. 66.1 Â± 5.4 cm/s (Healthy); P=0.019], the largest unipolar voltage [1086 Â± 241 vs. 982 Â± 230 (ICM with VT) vs. 853 Â± 281 (ICM no VT) vs. 802 Â± 108 ÂµV (Healthy); P=0.016], and the greatest voltage dispersion [median(interquartile range) 178(162-276) vs. 146(89-157) (ICM with VT) vs. 161(102-214) (ICM no VT) vs. 101(53-147) ÂµV (Healthy); P=0.017]. Differences were also observed in other endo-and epicardial basal and apical segments. 
Conclusion: Ventricular conduction velocity is slower in HCM when compared with ICM, even in myocardial segments remote from the region of maximal wall thickness, suggesting a distinct electrophysiological substrate in HCM.","/content/10.1101/19002782v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002782v1.full.pdf","2019-07-22","Cardiovascular Medicine

"A pooled analysis of the duration of chemoprophylaxis against malaria after treatment with artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine","Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) are the most commonly-used treatments against Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa. The lumefantrine and amodiaquine partner drugs may provide differing durations of post-treatment prophylaxis, an important additional benefit to patients. Analyzing 4214 individuals from clinical trials in 12 sites, we estimated a mean duration of post-treatment protection of 13.0 days (95% CI 10.7-15.7) for AL and 15.2 days (95% CI 12.8-18.4) for AS-AQ after allowing for transmission intensity. However, the duration varied substantially between sites: where wild type pfmdr1 86 and pfcrt 76 parasite genotypes predominated, AS-AQ provided ~2-fold longer protection than AL. Conversely, AL provided up to 1.5-fold longer protection than AS-AQ where mutants were common. We estimate that choosing AL or AS-AQ as first-line treatment according to local drug sensitivity could alter population-level clinical incidence of malaria by up to 14% in under-five year olds where malaria transmission is high.","/content/10.1101/19002741v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002741v1.full.pdf","2019-07-20","Public and Global Health

"Differential expression of selected microRNA and putative target genes in peripheral blood cells as early markers of severe forms of dengue","Background
 Dengue presents a wide clinical spectrum including asymptomatic dengue fever (DF) or severe forms, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Early symptoms of DHF are similar to those of non-life-threatening DF. Severe symptoms manifest after 3-5 days of fever, which can be life threatening due to lack of proper medications and inability to distinguish severe cases during the early stages. Early prediction of severe dengue in patients with no warning signs who may later develop severe infection is very important for proper disease management to alleviate DHF related complications and mortality. Due to the role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and remarkable stability of microRNA, altered expression of microRNA was evaluated to explore clinically relevant biomarkers. 
Methodology/Principal findings
 The relative expression of microRNA hsa-let-7e, hsa-miR-30b-5p, hsa-miR-30e-3p, hsa-miR-33a, and hsa-miR-150-5p and several putative target genes in peripheral blood cells (PBC) collected from 20 DF and 20 DHF positive patients within four days from fever onset was evaluated by qRT-PCR. hsa-miR-150-5p showed significant (P<0.05) up regulation in PBC of DHF patients compared to DF patients during the acute phase of infection. Expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was significantly (P<0.05) down regulated indicating that genes involved in epigenetic regulation are also differentially expressed in DHF patients during the early stage of infection. 
Conclusions/Significance
 Differential expression of microRNA miR-150-5p and the putative target gene EZH2 may serve as reliable biomarkers of disease severity during early stages of dengue infection.","/content/10.1101/19002725v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002725v1.full.pdf","2019-07-20","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Modified Long-Axis In-Plane Ultrasound Technique Versus Conventional Palpation Technique For Radial Arterial Cannulation: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: A low first-pass success rate of radial artery cannulation was obtained when using the conventional palpation technique(C-PT) or ultrasound-guided techniques, we therefore evaluate the effect of a modified long-axis in-plane ultrasound technique (M-LAINUT) in guiding radial artery cannulation in adults.
Methods:We conducted a prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial of 288 patients undergoing radial artery cannulation. Patients were randomized 1:1 to M-LAINUT or C-PT group at fujian medical university union hospital between 2017 and 2018. Radial artery cannulation was performed by three anesthesiologists with different experience. The outcome was the first and total radial artery cannulation success rates, the number of attempts and the cannulation time.
Results: 285 patients were statistically analyzed. The success rate of first attempt was 91.6% in the M-LAINUT group (n=143) and 57.7% in the C-PT group (n=142; P<0.001) (odds ratio, 7.9; 95% confidence interval, 4.0-15.7). The total success rate (=5 min and =3 attempts) in the M-LAINUT group was 97.9%, compared to 84.5% in the palpation group (p <0.001) (odds ratio, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-29.2). The total cannulation time was shorter and the number of attempts was fewer in the M-LAINUT group than that in the C-PT group (p <0. 05).
Conclusion: Modified long-axis in-plane ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation can increase the first and total radial artery cannulation success rates, reduce the number of attempts and shorten the total cannulation time in adults.","/content/10.1101/19001586v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001586v1.full.pdf","2019-07-20","Anesthesia

"Bias correction methods for test-negative designs in the presence of misclassification","The test-negative design has become a standard approach for vaccine effectiveness studies. However, previous studies suggested that it may be more sensitive than other designs to misclassification of disease outcome caused by imperfect diagnostic tests. This could be a particular limitation in vaccine effectiveness studies where simple tests (e.g. rapid influenza diagnostic tests) are used for logistical convenience. To address this issue, we derived a mathematical representation of the test-negative design with imperfect tests, then developed a bias correction framework for possible misclassification. Test-negative design studies usually include multiple covariates other than vaccine history to adjust potential confounders; our methods can also address multivariate analyses and be easily coupled with existing estimation tools. We validated the performance of these methods using simulations of common scenarios for vaccine efficacy and were able to obtain unbiased estimates in a variety of parameter settings.","/content/10.1101/19002691v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002691v1.full.pdf","2019-07-20","Epidemiology

"Automated Localization and Segmentation of Mononuclear Cell Aggregates in Kidney Histological Images Using Deep Learning","Allograft rejection is a major concern in kidney transplantation. Inflammatory processes in patients with kidney allografts involve various patterns of immune cell recruitment and distributions. Lymphoid aggregates (LAs) are commonly observed in patients with kidney allografts and their presence and localization may correlate with severity of acute rejection. Alongside with other markers of inflammation, LAs assessment is currently performed by pathologists manually in a qualitative way, which is both time consuming and far from precise. Here we present the first automated method of identifying LAs and measuring their densities in whole slide images of transplant kidney biopsies. We trained a deep convolutional neural network based on U-Net on 44 core needle kidney biopsy slides, monitoring loss on a validation set (n=7 slides). The model was subsequently tested on a hold-out set (n=10 slides). We found that the coarse pattern of LAs localization agrees between the annotations and predictions, which is reflected by high correlation between the annotated and predicted fraction of LAs area per slide (Pearson R of 0.9756). Furthermore, the network achieves an auROC of 97.78 Â± 0.93% and an IoU score of 69.72 Â± 6.24 % per LA-containing slide in the test set. Our study demonstrates that a deep convolutional neural network can accurately identify lymphoid aggregates in digitized histological slides of kidney. This study presents a first automatic DL-based approach for quantifying inflammation marks in allograft kidney, which can greatly improve precision and speed of assessment of allograft kidney biopsies when implemented as a part of computer-aided diagnosis system.","/content/10.1101/19002634v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002634v1.full.pdf","2019-07-20","Pathology

"Obstructive sleep apnea, positive airway pressure treatment, and postoperative delirium: protocol for a retrospective observational study","Introduction 

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common among older surgical patients, and delirium is a frequent and serious postoperative complication. Emerging evidence suggests that OSA increases the risk for postoperative delirium. We hypothesize that OSA is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium, and that in patients with OSA, perioperative adherence to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium and its sequelae. The proposed retrospective cohort analysis study will use existing datasets to: (i) describe and compare the incidence of postoperative delirium in surgical patients based on OSA diagnosis and treatment with PAP; (ii) assess whether preoperatively untreated OSA is independently associated with postoperative delirium; and (iii) explore whether preoperatively untreated OSA is independently associated with worse postoperative quality of life.  The findings of this study will inform on the potential utility and approach of an interventional trial aimed at preventing postoperative delirium in patients with diagnosed and undiagnosed OSA. 

Methods and Analysis 

Observational data from existing electronic databases will be used, including over 100,000 surgical patients and ~10,000 intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. We will obtain the incidence of postoperative delirium in adults admitted postoperatively to the ICU who underwent structured preoperative assessment, including OSA diagnosis and screening. We will use doubly robust propensity score methods to assess whether untreated OSA independently predicts postoperative delirium. Using similar methodology, we will assess if untreated OSA independently predicts worse postoperative quality of life.  

Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Human Research Protection Office at Washington University School of Medicine. We will publish the results in a peer-reviewed venue. Because the data is secondary and high risk for re-identification, we will not publicly share the data. Data will be destroyed after 1 year of completion of active IRB approved projects.","/content/10.1101/19002501v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002501v1.full.pdf","2019-07-19","Anesthesia

"Is therapeutic inertia present in primary diabetes care in Malaysia? A prospective study","Aims: This prospective study aimed to determine the proportions of therapeutic inertia when treatment targets not achieved in adults T2D at three public health clinics in Malaysia.
Methods: The index prescriptions were those when the annual blood tests were reviewed. Prescriptions were verified and classified as 1) no change, 2) stepping up and 3) stepping down. Multivariable logistic regression and sensitive analyses were conducted.
Results: At follow-up, 552 participants were available for the assessment of therapeutic inertia (78.9% response rate). The mean (SD) age and diabetes duration were 60.0 (9.9) years and 5.0 (6.0) years, respectively. High therapeutic inertia were observed in oral anti-diabetic (61-72%), anti-hypertensive (34-65%) and lipid-lowering therapies (56-77%), and lesser in insulin (34-52%). Insulin therapeutic inertia was more likely among those with shorter diabetes duration (adjusted OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.87, 0.98). Those who did not achieve treatment targets were less likely to experience therapeutic inertia: HbA1c = 7.0%: adjusted OR 0.10 (0.04, 0.24); BP = 140/90 mmHg: 0.28 (0.16, 0.50); LDL-cholesterol = 2.6 mmol/L: 0.37 (0.22, 0.64). 
Conclusions: Although therapeutic intensifications were more likely in the present of non-achieved treatment targets but the proportions of therapeutic inertia were high.","/content/10.1101/19002584v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002584v1.full.pdf","2019-07-19","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Characterizing co-occurring conditions by age at diagnosis in autism spectrum disorders","Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) experience a significant number of co-occurring medical conditions, yet little is known about these conditions beyond prevalence. We hypothesized that individuals with ASD experienced an increased burden of co-occurring conditions as measured by presence, frequency, and duration of visits related to co-occurring conditions. We expected that age of ASD diagnosis (early, < 7; late, > 7) would be associated with different co-occurring conditions. Medical record data were extracted from a large anonymized medical center database for 3097 individuals with ASD and 3097 matched controls. Co-occurring conditions were characterized using a novel tool (pyPheWAS) to examine presence, frequency, and duration of each condition. We identified several categories of co-occurring conditions in ASD: neurological (epilepsy, sleep disorders); psychiatric (mood disorders, adjustment/conduct disorders, suicidal ideation), and developmental. Early ASD diagnosis was associated with epilepsy-related conditions, whereas a later diagnosis was associated with psychiatric conditions. The early ASD diagnosis group had later first diagnosis of co-occurring psychiatric conditions compared to the late ASD diagnosis group. Our work confirms individuals with ASD are under a significant medical burden, with increased duration and frequency of visits associated with co-occurring conditions. Adequate management of these conditions could reduce burden on individuals with ASD.","/content/10.1101/19002527v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002527v1.full.pdf","2019-07-19","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

We investigated the six-month incidence of HIV-SN in ART naÃ¯ve individuals initiating tenofovir (TDF)-based cART, and the clinical factors associated with the development of HIV-SN. 120 neuropathy-free and ART naÃ¯ve individuals initiating cART at a single centre in Johannesburg, South Africa were enrolled. Participants were screened for HIV-SN at study enrolment and then approximately every two- months for a period of approximately six-months. Symptomatic HIV-SN was defined by the presence of at least one symptom (pain/burning, numbness, paraesthesias) and at least two clinical signs (reduced vibration sense, absent ankle reflexes or pin- prick hypoaesthesia). Asymptomatic HIV-SN required at least two clinical signs only. A total of 88% of the cohort completed three visits within the six-month period. Eleven individuals developed asymptomatic HIV-SN and nine developed symptomatic HIV-SN, giving a six-month cumulative incidence of neuropathy of 140 cases per 1000 patients (95% CI: 80 - 210) at an incidence rate of 0.37 (95% CI: 0.2 - 0.5) per person year. Increasing height and active tuberculosis (TB) disease were independently associated with the risk of developing HIV-SN (p << 0.05). We found that within the first six months of starting cART, incident SN persists in the post- stavudine era, but may be asymptomatic.","/content/10.1101/19002220v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002220v1.full.pdf","2019-07-19","Neurology

"Specific diagnostic method for St. Louis Encephalitis Virus using a non-structural protein as antigen.","St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is a mosquito-borne reemerging flavivirus in Argentina. It is currently necessary to develop specific serological tests that can efficiently discriminate the flaviviruses that circulate in our country. The immunoassays to diagnose SLEV lack specificity because they are based on the detection of structural viral proteins and the human immunoglobulins produced during infection against these proteins cross-react with other flaviviruses. Here, we describe an enzyme-immunoassay designed to detect human IgG antibodies specific to the viral nonstructural protein NS5. The results indicate that NS5 is a promising antigen useful to discriminate SLEV from other circulating flaviviruses.","/content/10.1101/19002030v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002030v1.full.pdf","2019-07-19","Epidemiology

"Acute hepatitis C infection among adults with HIV in the Netherlands: a capture-recapture analysis","Background: Reliable surveillance systems are essential to assess the national response to eliminating hepatitis C virus (HCV), in the context of the global strategy towards eliminating viral hepatitis.

Aim: We aimed to assess the completeness of the two national registries of acute HCV infection in people with HIV, and estimated the number of acute HCV infections among adults with HIV in the Netherlands.

Methods: For 2003-2016, cases of HCV infection and reinfection among adults with a positive or unknown HIV-serostatus were identified in two national registries: the ATHENA cohort, and the National Registry for Notifiable Diseases. For 2013-2016, cases were linked, and two-way capture-recapture analysis was carried out. 

Results: During 2013-2016, there were an estimated 282 (95%CI: 264-301) acute HCV infections among adults with HIV. The addition of cases with an unknown HIV-serostatus increased the matches (from N=104 to N=129), and a subsequently increased the estimated total: 330 (95%CI: 309-351). Underreporting was estimated at 14-20%.

Conclusion: In 2013-2016, up to 330 cases of acute HCV infection were estimated to have occurred among adults with HIV. National surveillance of acute HCV can be improved by increased notification of infections. Surveillance data should ideally include both acute and chronic HCV infections, and be able to distinguish between acute and chronic infections, and initial and reinfections.","/content/10.1101/19002097v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002097v1.full.pdf","2019-07-19","Epidemiology

"Maternal and child gluten intake and risk of type 1 diabetes: The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study","OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between maternal and child gluten intake and risk of type 1 diabetes in children.
DESIGN: Pregnancy cohort
SETTING: Population-based, nation-wide study in Norway
PARTICIPANTS: 86,306 children in The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study born from 1999 through 2009, followed to April 15, 2018.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical type 1 diabetes, ascertained in a nation-wide childhood diabetes registry. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression for the exposures maternal gluten intake up to week 22 of pregnancy and child's gluten intake when the child was 18 months old.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 12.3 years (range 0.7-16.0), 346 children (0.4%) developed type 1 diabetes (incidence rate 32.6 per 100,000 person-years). The average gluten intake was 13.6 grams/day for mothers during pregnancy, and 8.8 grams/day for the child at 18 months of age. Maternal gluten intake in mid-pregnancy was not associated with the development of type 1 diabetes in the child (adjusted hazard ratio 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.43) per 10 grams/day increase in gluten intake). However, the child's gluten intake at 18 months of age was associated with an increased risk of later developing type 1 diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 2.01) per 10 grams/day increase in gluten intake).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the child's gluten intake at 18 months of age, and not the maternal intake during pregnancy, could increase the risk of type 1 diabetes in the child.","/content/10.1101/19001883v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001883v1.full.pdf","2019-07-19","Nutrition

"Association between myopia and peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structures in children","Purpose: To investigate the characteristics of children with peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structures (PHOMS) and evaluate the risk factors associated with PHOMS. 
Methods: This study included 132 eyes of 66 children with PHOMS and 92 eyes of 46 children without PHOMS (controls) who were assessed by disc enhanced depth image spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Univariable and multivariable logistic analyses were performed to evaluate risk factors associated with the presence of PHOMS. 
Results: Among the 66 children with PHOMS, 53 patients (80.3%) had bilateral and 13 patients (19.7%) had unilateral PHOMS. The mean age of the PHOMS group was 11.7 Â± 2.6 years and 11.4 Â± 3.1 years in the control group. Mean spherical equivalent (SE) by cycloplegic refraction was -3.13 Â± 1.87 diopters (D) in the PHOMS group and -0.95 Â± 2.65 D in the control group. Mean astigmatism was 0.67 Â± 0.89 D and 0.88 Â± 1.02 D in the PHOMS group and the control group, respectively. Mean disc size was 1735 Â± 153 Âµ in the PHOMS group and 1741 Â± 190 Âµ in the control group. All eyes in PHOMS group had myopia of -0.50 D or less, except for an eye with +1.00 D. According to the univariable (odds ratio [OR] 1.59, P < 0.001) and multivariable (OR 2.00, P < 0.001) logistic regression analyses, SE decreased by 1 D was significantly associated with PHOMS. 
Conclusion: PHOMS is associated with myopic shift in children. Optic disc tilt may be a mediator between myopia and PHOMS.","/content/10.1101/19001180v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001180v1.full.pdf","2019-07-19","Ophthalmology

"Analysis of the outcome of patients with stage IV uterine serous carcinoma mimicking ovarian cancer","Objectives: 
To identify clinicopathological factors that might influence survival in patients with stage IV uterine serous carcinoma, and to compare survival outcomes in patients with stage IV uterine serous carcinoma managed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreduction (with or without adjuvant chemotherapy), primary cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. 

Methods:
A retrospective cohort study of all patients with stage IV Uterine serous carcinoma treated between 2005 and 2015 within a regional cancer centre. Progression-free and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan Meier method.

Results:
Of 50 women with stage IV uterine serous carcinoma who met inclusion criteria, 37 underwent primary cytoreductive surgery, nine received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with planned interval cytoreductive surgery and four received palliative care only. A pre-treatment diagnosis of stage IV uterine serous carcinoma was made for only 45.9% of the primary cytoreductive surgery group and 56.6% of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group, with advanced ovarian cancer the most common preoperative misdiagnosis. Median follow up was 19 months. Median overall survival was 27 months for the primary cytoreductive surgery group, 20 months for the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and two months for the palliative care group. Optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 67.6% of the primary cytoreductive surgery group and 87.5% of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group who underwent interval cytoreduction. Optimal cytoreduction was associated with improvement in overall survival, compared with suboptimal cytoreduction (36 versus 15 months; P=0.16). Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly higher overall survival compared with no adjuvant chemotherapy (36 versus four months; P<0.05). Median overall survival was 16 months for those with pure uterine serous carcinoma (n=40), compared with 32 months for those with mixed histopathology (n=10).

Conclusion:
Stage IV uterine serous carcinoma can mimic advanced ovarian cancer. It carries a poor prognosis, which is worse for pure uterine serous carcinoma than for mixed-type endometrial adenocarcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreduction and adjuvant chemotherapy seems to be a safe option, with an increased rate of optimal cytoreduction and comparable overall survival, compared with primary cytoreductive surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improves survival in all groups.","/content/10.1101/19002410v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002410v1.full.pdf","2019-07-16","Obstetrics and Gynecology

"Periodic testing and estimation of STD-HIV association","Background: The validity of measures used in follow-up studies to estimate the magnitude of the STD-HIV association will be the focus of this paper. A recent simulation study by Boily et al based on a model of HIV and STD transmission showed that the relative risk (RR), estimated by the hazard rate ratio (HRR) obtained by the Cox model had poor validity, either in absence or in presence of a real association between HIV and STD. The HRR tends to underestimate the true magnitude of a non-null association. These results were obtained from simulated follow-up studies where HIV was periodically tested every three months and every month for the STD.
Aims and methods: This paper extends the above results by investigating the impact of using different periodic testing intervals on the validity of HRR estimates. Issues regarding the definition of exposure to STDs in this context are explored. A stochastic model for the transmission of HIV and other STDs is used to simulate follow-up studies with difference periodic testing intervals. HRR estimates obtained with the Cox model with a time-dependent STD exposure covariate are compared to the true magnitude of the HIV-STD association. In addition, real data are reanalysed using the STD exposure definition described in the paper. The data from Laga et al are used for this purpose.
Results: (1) Simulate data: independently of the magnitude of the true association, we observed a greater reduction of the bias when increasing the frequency of HIV testing than that of the STD testing. (2) Real data: The STD exposure definition can create substantial differences in the estimation of the HIV-STD association. Laga et al have found a HRR of 2.5 (1.1 - 6.4) for the association between HIV and genital ulcer disease compare to an estimate of 3.5 (1.5 - 8.3) with our improved definition of exposure.
Conclusions: Results on the simulated data have an important impact on the design of field studies. For instance when choosing between two designs; one where both HIV and STD are screened every 3 months versus one where HIV and STD are screened every 3 months and monthly, respectively. The latter design is more expensive and involves more complicated logistics. Furthermore, this increment in cost may not be justified considering the relatively small gain in terms of validity and variability.","/content/10.1101/19002345v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002345v1.full.pdf","2019-07-16","HIV/AIDS

"Interdependence between confirmed and discarded cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses in Brazil: A multivariate time-series analysis","The co-circulation of different arboviruses in the same time and space poses a significant threat to public health given their rapid geographic dispersion and serious health, social, and economic impact. Therefore, it is crucial to have high quality of case registration to estimate the real impact of each arboviruses in the population. In this work, a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model was developed to investigate the interrelationships between discarded and confirmed cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Brazil. We used data from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) from 2010 to 2017. There were two waves in the series of dengue notification in this period, one occurring in 2013 and the second in 2015. The series of reported cases of both Zika and chikungunya reached their peak in late 2015 and early 2016. The VAR model shows that the Zika series have a significant impact on the dengue series and vice versa, suggesting that several discarded and confirmed cases of dengue could actually have been cases of Zika. The model also suggests that the series of confirmed chikungunya cases is almost independent of the cases of dengue and Zika. In conclusion, co-circulation of arboviruses with similar symptoms could lead to misdiagnosed diseases in the surveillance system. We argue that the use of mathematical and statistical models routinely in association with traditional symptom-surveillance could help to decrease such errors and to provide early indication of possible future outbreaks. These findings address the challenges regarding notification biases and shed new light on how to handle reported cases based only in clinical-epidemiological criteria when multiples arboviruses co-circulate in the same population.","/content/10.1101/19002246v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002246v1.full.pdf","2019-07-16","Epidemiology

"The global scientific research response to the public health emergency of Zika virus infection","Background: Science studies have been a field of research for different knowledge areas and they have been successfully used to analyse the construction of scientific knowledge, practice and dissemination. In this study, we aimed to verify how the Zika epidemic has moulded scientific production worldwide analysing international collaboration and the knowledge landscape through time, research topics and country involvement.

Methodology: We searched the Web of Science (WoS) for studies published up to 31st December 2018 on Zika using the search terms zika, zkv or zikv. We analysed the scientific production regarding which countries have published the most, on which topics, as well as country level collaboration.  We performed a scientometric analysis of research on Zika focusing on knowledge mapping and the scientific research path over time and space.

Findings: We found two well defined research areas divided into three subtopics accounting for six clusters. With regard to country analysis, the USA followed by Brazil were the leading countries in publications on Zika. China entered as a new player focusing on specific research areas. When we took into consideration the epidemics and reported cases, Brazil and France were the leading research countries on related topics. As for international collaboration, the USA followed by England and France stand out as the main hubs.   The research areas most published included public health related topics from 2015 until the very beginning of 2016, followed by an increase in topics related to the clinical aspects of the disease in 2016 and the beginnings of laboratorial research in 2017/2018.

Conclusions: Mapping the response to Zika, a public health emergency, demonstrated a clear pattern of the participation of countries in the scientific advances. The pattern of knowledge production found in this study represented the different perspectives and interests of countries based firstly on their level of exposure to the epidemic and secondly on their financial positions with regard to science.","/content/10.1101/19001313v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001313v1.full.pdf","2019-07-16","Epidemiology

"Childhood Trauma and Trajectories of Depressive Symptoms Across Adolescence","Background:
Growth curve modelling such as trajectory analysis is useful for examining the longitudinal nature of depressive symptoms, their antecedents and later consequences. However, issues in interpretation associated with this methodology could hinder the translation from results to policy changes and interventions. The aim of this article is to provide a model interpretation framework for highlighting growth curve results in a more interpretable manner. Here we demonstrate the association between childhood trauma and trajectories of depressive symptoms. Childhood trauma has been shown to a be strong predictor for later depression, but less is known how childhood trauma has an effect throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Identifying when childhood trauma (and its severity) is likely to have its greatest impact on depression is important for determining the timing of interventions for depression. 
Methods:
We used data on over 6,500 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to estimate trajectories of depressive symptoms between the ages of 11 and 24. Depressive symptoms were measured using the short mood and feelings questionnaire (SMFQ) across 9 occasions. Childhood trauma was assessed between the ages of 5 and 10 years old, and we estimated population averaged multilevel growth curves of depressive symptoms for exposure to trauma (yes vs no) and then in a separate model, the number of trauma types reported such as inter-personal violence or neglect (coded as 0, 1, 2, 3+). We then calculated what the depressive symptoms scores would be ages 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, between these varying trajectories. 
Results:
Reported exposure to childhood trauma was associated with less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence, mainly characterised by exposed individuals having worse depressive symptoms at age 16. There was an exposure-response relationship between the number of childhood traumas and trajectories of depressive symptoms. Individuals exposed to 3 or more types of trauma had substantially steeper and less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms: becoming worse at a more rapid rate until the age of 18. By age 18, individuals that reported the greatest exposure to trauma (3+ types of trauma) had 14% more depressive symptoms compared to non-exposed participants.
Limitations:
This study was subject to attrition, particularly towards the latter ages of the SMFQ.
Conclusion:
Childhood trauma is strongly associated with less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence. Individuals exposed to multiple types of inter-personal violence or neglect are at the greatest risk of worsening depressive symptoms throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Individuals exposed to traumatic experiences in childhood should be identified as at high risk of depression and other adverse outcomes as early trauma may disrupt social development and have lasting consequences on mental health outcomes. The model interpretation framework presented here may be more interpretable for researchers, clinicians and policy makers as it allows comparisons of depression across multiple stages of development to highlight when the effects of depression are greatest.","/content/10.1101/19002519v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002519v1.full.pdf","2019-07-16","Epidemiology

"Early clinical markers of aggressive multiple sclerosis","Patients with the 'aggressive' form of MS accrue disability at an accelerated rate, typically reaching EDSS >= 6 within 10 years of symptom onset. Several clinicodemographic factors have been associated with aggressive MS, but less research has focused on clinical markers that are present in the first year of disease. The development of early predictive models of aggressive MS is essential to optimise treatment in this MS subtype. We evaluated whether patients who will develop severe MS can be identified based on early clinical markers, and to replicate this analysis in an independent cohort. Patient data were obtained from MSBase. Inclusion criteria were (a) first recorded disability score (EDSS) within 12 months of symptom onset, (b) at least 2 recorded EDSS scores, and (c) at least 10 years of observation time. Patients were classified as having 'aggressive MS' if they: (a) reached EDSS >= 6 within 10 years of symptom onset, (b) EDSS >=6 was confirmed and sustained over >=6 months, and (c) EDSS >=6 was sustained until the end of follow-up. Clinical predictors included patient variables (sex, age at onset, baseline EDSS, disease duration at first visit) and recorded relapses in the first 12 months since disease onset (count, pyramidal signs, bowel-bladder symptoms, cerebellar signs, incomplete relapse recovery, steroid administration, hospitalisation). Predictors were evaluated using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). Independent validation was performed using data from the Swedish MS Registry. Of the 2,403 patients identified, 145 were classified as having aggressive MS (6%). BMA identified three statistical predictors: age > 35 at symptom onset, EDSS >= 3 in the first year, and the presence of pyramidal signs in the first year. This model significantly predicted aggressive MS (AUC = .80, 95% CIs = .75, .84). The presence of all three signs was strongly predictive, with 32% of such patients meeting aggressive disease criteria. The absence of all three signs was associated with a 1.4% risk. Of the 556 eligible patients in the Swedish MS Registry cohort, 34 (6%) met criteria for aggressive MS. The combination of all three signs was also predictive in this cohort (AUC = .75, 95% CIs = .66, .84). Taken together, these findings suggest that older age at symptom onset, greater disability during the first year, and pyramidal signs in the first year are early indicators of aggressive MS.","/content/10.1101/19002063v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002063v1.full.pdf","2019-07-16","Neurology

"Cardiac arrest outcomes after targeted temperature management with an esophageal cooling device","Objective: To assess the efficacy of an esophageal device to provide TTM (Target Temperature Management) post Cardiac Arrest. Design: A chart review of all patients treated with ETTM, following cardiac arrest.  Initial patient temperature, time to target, supplemental methods (water blankets, head wraps, or ice packs), and patient survival were extracted for analysis. Setting: Community Medical Center Intensive Care Unit. Patients: All patients receiving TTM via an esophageal device post Cardiac Arrest from August 2016 to November 2018. Interventions: TTM both cooling and warming via an esophageal device. Measurements and Results:  A total of 54 patients were treated from August 2016 to November 2018; 30 received ETM only, 22 received supplemental cooling, and 2 had treatment discontinued prior to reaching target due to recovery.  Target temperatures ranged from 32 to 36 degrees. The median time to target temperature for the entire cohort was 219 minutes (IQR 81-415).  For the cohorts without, and with, supplemental cooling modalities, the median time to attain target temperature was 128 minutes (IQR 71-334), and 285 minutes (IQR 204-660), respectively.  Survival to ICU discharge was 51.9% for the entire cohort. Conclusions:  ETM attains target temperature at a rate consistent with current guidelines and with similar performance to alternative modalities. This may provide a more cost-effective and approachable core cooling option to community hospitals that only use water blankets or other surface methods.","/content/10.1101/19001487v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001487v2.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine

"Disease overarching mechanisms that explain and predict outcome of patients with high cardiovascular risk: rationale and design of the Berlin Long-term Observation of Vascular Events (BeLOVE) study","Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature death worldwide. Effective and individualized treatment requires exact knowledge about both risk factors and risk estimation. Most evidence for risk prediction currently comes from population-based studies on first incident cardiovascular events. In contrast, little is known about the relevance of risk factors for the outcome of patients with established CVD or those who are at high risk of CVD, including patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, most studies focus on individual diseases, whereas less is known about disease overarching risk factors and cross-over risk.
Aim: The aim of BeLOVE is to improve short- and long-term prediction and mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular disease progression and outcomes in very high-risk patients, both in the acute as well as in the chronic phase, in order to provide the basis for improved, individualized management.
Study design: BeLOVE is an observational prospective cohort study of patients of both sexes aged >18 in selected Berlin hospitals, who have a high risk of future cardiovascular events, including patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute stroke (AS), acute heart failure (AHF), acute kidney injury (AKI) or type 2 diabetes with manifest target-organ damage. BeLOVE includes 2 subcohorts: The acute subcohort includes 6500 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI within 2-8 days after their qualifying event, who undergo a structured interview about medical history as well as blood sample collection. The chronic subcohort includes 6000 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI 90 days after event, and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and target-organ damage. These patients undergo a 6-8 hour deep phenotyping program, including detailed clinical phenotyping from a cardiological, neurological and metabolic perspective, questionnaires including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)as well as magnetic resonance imaging. Several biological samples are collected (i.e. blood, urine, saliva, stool) with blood samples collected in a fasting state, as well as after a metabolic challenge (either nutritional or cardiopulmonary exercise stress test). Ascertainment of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) will be performed in all patients using a combination of active and passive follow up procedures, such as on-site visits (if applicable), telephone interviews, review of medical charts, and links to local health authorities. Additional phenotyping visits are planned at 2, 5 and 10 years after inclusion into the chronic subcohort.
Future perspective: BeLOVE provides a unique opportunity to study both the short- and long-term disease course of patients at high cardiovascular risk through innovative and extensive deep phenotyping. Moreover, the unique study design provides opportunities for acute and post-acute inclusion and allows us to derive two non-nested yet overlapping sub-cohorts, tailored for upcoming research questions. Thereby, we aim to study disease overarching research questions, to understand crossover risk, and to find similarities and differences between clinical phenotypes of patients at high cardiovascular risk.","/content/10.1101/19001024v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001024v2.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Optimising the use of molecular tools for the diagnosis of yaws","Introduction
Yaws is a neglected tropical disease and results in lesions of skin, soft tissues and bones. PCR plays an important part in surveillance. 

Methods
Children suspected to have yaws were enrolled. From the largest lesion paired swabs were collected; one into transport medium and one as a dry swab. In children with multiple lesions we collected additional swabs from up to four subsequent lesions. Swabs in transport medium were maintained in a cold-chain whilst dry swabs were stored at ambient temperature. Swabs were tested by PCR for Treponema pallidum and Haemophilus ducreyi.  

Results
Of 55 individuals, 10 (18%) had at least 1 positive PCR for T. pallidum and 12 (22%) had at least 1 positive result for H. ducreyi. Concordance was 100% between swabs in transport medium and dry swabs. One patient had PCR-confirmed yaws on the swab of a third lesion when both the first and second lesions were PCR-negative. 

Discussion
Storing swabs in transport medium and transporting in  a cold chain did not improve yield, however detection of T. pallidum is increased by swabbing additional lesions. As the target for yaws is eradication approaches to sample collection need revisiting to ensure cases are not missed.","/content/10.1101/19000232v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000232v3.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

Community based cross sectional study","Introduction: Epilepsy is chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent derangement of the nervous system due to sudden excessive disorderly discharge of the cerebral neurons. People living with epilepsy continue to suffer from enacted or perceived stigma that is based on myths, misconceptions, and misunderstandings that have persisted for many years. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the community general knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy. Methods: Community based cross sectional study was conducted to assess public general knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy and its associated factors using structured pretested questionnaire. Data was entered into Epi data version 3.1 and transported to SPSS version 21 further analysis. Both Bivariable and Multivariable Logistic Regression was done to identify associated factors. Odds Ratios and their 95% Confidence interval was computed and variables with p value less than 0.05 was considered significantly associated factors.  Results: 596 study participants were participated with a response rate of 98%. Among the study participants 43.6 (95% CI: 39.6, 47.5) had poor knowledge and 41.3 (95% CI: 37.4, 45.1) had unfavorable attitude.  Being secondary education, marital status, witnessed seizure, and heard the term epilepsy were showed statistically significant association with poor knowledge about epilepsy. Level of education, low average monthly income, not witnessed seizure, not heard the term epilepsy and distant from health facility showed statically significant association with the unfavorable attitude. Conclusion: In this study, Debre Berhan communities were found to have deficits in terms of general knowledge and attitude about epilepsy; and it should be given due attention.","/content/10.1101/19001578v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001578v2.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Epidemiology

"Bayesian spatial modelling of childhood cancer incidence in Switzerland using exact point data: A nationwide study during 1985-2015.","Background: The aetiology of most childhood cancers is largely unknown. Spatially varying environmental factors such as traffic-related air pollution, background radiation and agricultural pesticides might contribute to the development of childhood cancer. We investigated the spatial variation of childhood cancers in Switzerland using exact geocodes of place of residence. Methods: We included 5,947 children diagnosed with cancer during 1985-2015 at age 0-15 from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We modelled cancer risk using log-Gaussian Cox processes and indirect standardization to adjust for age and year of diagnosis. We examined whether the modelled spatial variation of risk can be explained by ambient air concentration of NO2, natural background radiation, area-based socio-economic position (SEP), linguistic region, years of existing general cancer registration in the canton or degree of urbanization. Results: For all childhood cancers combined, the posterior median relative risk (RR), compared to the national level, varied by location from 0.83 to 1.13 (min to max). Corresponding ranges were 0.96 to 1.09 for leukaemia, 0.90 to 1.13 for lymphoma, and 0.82 to 1.23 for CNS tumours. The covariates considered explained 72% of the observed spatial variation for all cancers, 81% for leukaemia, 82% for lymphoma and 64% for CNS tumours. There was evidence of an association of background radiation and SEP with incidence of CNS tumours, (1.19;0.98-1.40) and (1.6;1-1.13) respectively. Conclusion: Of the investigated diagnostic groups, childhood CNS tumours show the largest spatial variation in Switzerland. The selected covariates only partially explained the observed variation of CNS tumours suggesting that other environmental factors also play a role.","/content/10.1101/19001545v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001545v2.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Epidemiology

"An Assessment of Transparency and Reproducibility-related Research Practices in Otolaryngology","Introduction: Clinical research serves as the foundation for evidence-based patient care, and reproducibility of results is consequently critical. We sought to assess the transparency and reproducibility of research studies in otolaryngology by evaluating a random sample of publications in otolaryngology journals between 2014 and 2018.
Methods: We used the National Library of Medicine catalog to identify otolaryngology journals that met the inclusion criteria (available in the English language and indexed in MEDLINE). From these journals, we extracted a random sample of 300 publications using a PubMed search for records published between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. Specific indicators of reproducible and transparent research practices were evaluated in a blinded, independent, and duplicate manner using a pilot-tested Google form. 
Results: Our initial search returned 26,498 records, from which 300 were randomly selected for analysis. Of these 300 records, 286 met inclusion criteria and 14 did not. Among the empirical studies, 2% (95% CI, 0.4%-3.5%) of publications indicated that raw data were available, 0.6% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.6%) reported an analysis script, 5.3% (95% CI, 2.7%-7.8%) were linked to an accessible research protocol, and 3.9% (95% CI, 1.7%-6.1%) were preregistered. None of the publications had a clear statement claiming to replicate, or to be a replication of, another study. 
Conclusions: Inadequate reproducibility practices exist in otolaryngology. Nearly all studies in our analysis lacked a data or material availability statement, did not link to an accessible protocol, and were not preregistered. Most studies were not available as open access. Taking steps to improve reproducibility would likely also improve patient care.","/content/10.1101/19002238v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002238v1.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Otolaryngology

"Reliability and validity of the UK Biobank cognitive tests","UK Biobank is a health resource with data from over 500,000 adults. The participants have been assessed on cognitive function since baseline. The cognitive tests in UK Biobank are brief and bespoke, and are administered without supervision on a touchscreen computer. Psychometric information on the tests is limited. The present study examined their concurrent validity and short-term test-retest reliability. A sample of 160 participants (mean age=62.59, SD=10.24) completed the UK Biobank cognitive assessment and a range of well-validated cognitive tests ('reference tests'). Fifty-two participants returned 4 weeks later to repeat the UK Biobank tests. Correlations were calculated between UK Biobank tests and the reference tests. Four-week test-retest correlations were calculated for UK Biobank tests. UK Biobank cognitive tests showed a range of correlations with their respective reference tests, i.e. those tests that are thought to assess the same underlying cognitive ability (mean Pearson r=0.53, range=0.22 to 0.83, p=.005). Four-week test-retest reliability of the UK Biobank tests were moderate-to-high (mean Pearson r=0.55, range=0.40 to 0.89, p=.003). Despite the brief, non-standard nature of the UK Biobank cognitive tests, some showed substantial concurrent validity and test-retest reliability. These psychometric results provide currently-lacking information on the validity of the UK Biobank cognitive tests.","/content/10.1101/19002204v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002204v1.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Epidemiology

"Expert-validated estimation of diagnostic uncertainty for deep neural networks in diabetic retinopathy detection","Deep learning-based systems can achieve a diagnostic performance comparable to physicians in a variety of medical use cases including the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. To be useful in clinical practise, it is necessary to have well calibrated measures of the uncertainty with which these systems report their decisions. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are being often overconfident in their predictions, and are not amenable to a straightforward probabilistic treatment.  Here, we describe an intuitive framework based on test-time data augmentation for quantifying the diagnostic uncertainty of a state-of-the-art DNN for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy. We show that the derived measure of uncertainty is well-calibrated and that experienced physicians likewise find cases with uncertain diagnosis difficult to evaluate. This paves the way for an integrated treatment of uncertainty in DNN-based diagnostic systems.","/content/10.1101/19002154v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002154v1.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Ophthalmology

"Pain in clients attending a South African voluntary counselling and testing centre was frequent and extensive but did not depend on HIV status.","Background: The frequency of pain is reported to be high in people living with HIV (PLWH), but valid comparisons between PLWH and HIV-negative cohorts are rare. We investigated whether HIV infection influenced frequency and characteristics of pain in adults undergoing voluntary testing for HIV.
Methods: Participants were recruited from a HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) centre at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Soweto, South Africa. Pain was assessed using the Wisconsin Brief Pain Questionnaire. Depressive and anxiety symptomatology was determined using the Hopkins Symptom checklist-25. We then stratified by HIV status.
Results: Data from 535 black South Africans were analysed: HIV-infected n=70, HIV uninfected n=465. Overall, frequency of pain was high with 59% (95%CI: 55; 63, n: 316/535) of participants reporting pain, with no difference related to HIV status: HIV-infected 50% (95% CI: 37; 61, n: 35/70), HIV-uninfected 60% (95%CI: 56; 65, n: 281/465). Pain intensity and number of pain sites were similar between the groups as were symptoms of anxiety and depression: mean HSCL-25 1.72 (95% CI 1.57; 1.87) HIV-infected participants and 1.68 (95% CI: 1.63; 1.73) HIV-uninfected participants. Univariate analysis showed female sex and greater depressive and anxiety symptomatology associated with having pain. In a conservative multivariable model, only depressive and anxiety symptomatology was retained in the model.
Conclusion: The high frequency of pain found in both HIV infected and uninfected individuals presenting at a VCT centre was more likely to be associated with depression and anxiety, than with the presence or absence of HIV.","/content/10.1101/19001784v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001784v1.full.pdf","2019-07-15","HIV/AIDS

"Evaluation of Indicators of Reproducibility and Transparency in Published Cardiology Literature","Abstract:
Background 
The extent of reproducibility in cardiology research remains unclear. Therefore, our main objective was to determine the quality of research published in cardiology journals using eight indicators of reproducibility.
Methods
Using a cross-sectional study design, we conducted an advanced search of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) catalog for publications from 2014-2018 in journals pertaining to cardiology. Journals must have been published in the English language and must have been indexed in MEDLINE. Once the initial list of publications from all cardiology journals was obtained, we searched for full-text PDF versions using Open Access, Google Scholar, and PubMed. Studies were analyzed using a pilot-tested Google Form to evaluate the presence of information that was deemed necessary to reproduce the study in its entirety. 
Results 
After exclusions, we included 132 studies containing empirical data. Of these studies, the majority (126/132, 95.5%) did not provide the raw data collected while conducting the study, 0/132 (0%) provided step-by-step analysis scripts, and 117/132 (88.6%) failed to provide sufficient materials needed to reproduce the study. 
Conclusions
The presentation of studies published in cardiology journals does not appear to facilitate reproproducible research. Considerable improvements to the framework of biomedical science, specifically in the field of cardiology, are necessary. Solutions to increase the reproducibility and transparency of published works in cardiology journals is warranted, including addressing inadequate sharing of materials, raw data, and key methodological details.","/content/10.1101/19002121v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002121v1.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Educational differentials in domain specific physical activity by ethnicity, age, and gender: findings from over 44,000 participants in The UK Household Longitudinal Study (2013-2015).","Background: The prevalence of overall physical inactivity remains high, particularly amongst socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. It is unclear however if such inequalities vary systematically by age, sex, or ethnicity, and if there are differing effects across physical activity (PA) domains. 
Methods: We used data from a nationally representative survey of the UK, Understanding Society, with information on educational attainment (our indicator of socioeconomic position), PA and demographics collected in 2013-2015 (N= 44,903). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to test associations of education with three different PA domains (active travel, occupational and leisure time). To examine modification of the associations between education and physical activity in each domain by sex, age and ethnicity, we tested two-way interaction terms (education x ethnicity; education x sex; education x age). 
Results: Lower educational attainment was associated with higher active transportation and occupational physical activity, but lower weekly leisure-time activity. These associations were modified by sex, ethnicity, and age. For example, education-related differences in active travel were larger for females (difference in predicted probability of activity between highest and lowest educational groups: -10% in females, (95% CI: -11.9, 7.9) -3% in males (-4.8, -0.4). The education-related differences in occupational activity were larger among males -35% (-36.9, -32.4) than females -17% (-19.4, -15.0). Finally, education related differences in moderate to vigorous leisure time activity varied most substantially by ethnicity; for example, differences were 17% (16.2, 18.7)  for White individuals compared with 6% (0.6, 11.6) for Black individuals. 
Conclusions: Educational differences in PA vary by domain, and are modified by age, sex, and ethnicity. A better understanding of physically inactive sub-groups may aid development of tailored interventions to increase activity levels and reduce health inequalities.","/content/10.1101/19002105v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002105v1.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Epidemiology

"Confounding adjustment performance of ordinal analysis methods in stroke studies","Background: In acute stroke studies, ordinal logistic regression (OLR) is often used to analyze outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), whereas the non-parametric Mann-Whitney measure of superiority (MWS) has also been suggested. It is unclear how these perform comparatively when confounding adjustment is warranted. Our aim is to quantify the performance of OLR and MWS in different confounding variable settings.
Methods: We set up a simulation study with three different scenarios; (1) dichotomous confounding variables, (2) continuous confounding variables, and (3) confounding variable settings mimicking a study on functional outcome after stroke. We compared adjusted ordinal logistic regression (aOLR) and stratified Mann-Whitney measure of superiority (sMWS), and also used propensity scores to stratify the MWS (psMWS). For comparability, OLR estimates were transformed to a MWS. We report bias, the percentage of runs that produced a point estimate deviating by more than 0.05 points (point estimate variation), and the coverage probability.
Results: In scenario 1, there was no bias in both sMWS and aOLR, with similar point estimate variation and coverage probabilities. In scenario 2, sMWS resulted in more bias (0.04 versus 0.00), and higher point estimate variation (41.6% versus 3.3%), whereas coverage probabilities were similar. In scenario 3, there was no bias in both methods, point estimate variation was higher in the sMWS (6.7%) versus aOLR (1.1%), and coverage probabilities were 0.98 (sMWS) versus 0.95 (aOLR). With psMWS, bias remained 0.00, with less point estimate variation (1.5%) and a coverage probability of 0.95.
Conclusions: The bias of both adjustment methods was similar in our stroke simulation scenario, and the higher point estimate variation in the MWS improved with propensity score based stratification. The stratified MWS is a valid alternative for adjusted OLR only when the ratio of number of strata versus number of observations is relatively low, but propensity score based stratification extends the application range of the MWS.","/content/10.1101/19000943v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000943v1.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Epidemiology

"Reproducibility and transparency characteristics of oncology research evidence","Introduction: As much as 50%-90% of research is estimated to be irreproducible, costing upwards of $28 billion in the United States alone. Reproducible research practices are essential to improving the reproducibility and transparency of biomedical research, such as including pre-registering studies, publishing a protocol, making research data and metadata publicly available, and publishing in open access journals. Here we report an investigation of key reproducible or transparent research practices in the published oncology literature.

Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a random sample of 300 oncology studies published from 2014-2018. We extracted key reproducibility and transparency characteristics in a duplicative fashion by blinded investigators using a pilot tested Google Form. 

Results: Of the 300 studies randomly sampled, 296 studies were analyzed for study reproducibility characteristics. Of these 296 studies, 194 were contained empirical data that could be analyzed for reproducible and transparent research practices. Raw data was available for 9 studies (4.6%). Approximately 5 studies (2.6%) provided a protocol. Despite our sample including 15 clinical trials and 7 systematic reviews/meta-analyses, only 7 included a pre-registration statement. Less than 25% (65/194) of studies provided an author conflict of interest statement. 

Discussion: We found that key reproducibility and transparency characteristics were absent from a random sample of published oncology studies. We recommend required pre-registration for all eligible trials and systematic reviews, published protocols for all manuscripts, and deposition of raw data and metadata in public repositories.","/content/10.1101/19001917v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001917v1.full.pdf","2019-07-14","Oncology

"Deficient goal-directed control in a population characterized by extreme goal pursuit","Computational neuroscience has contributed to understanding compulsive behavior by distinguishing habitual from goal-directed choice through model-free and model-based learning. Yet, questions remain about applying this approach to psychiatric conditions that are characterized by complex behaviors that occur outside the laboratory. Here, we compared individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), whose self-starvation appears both excessively goal-directed and habitual, with healthy controls (HC) to assess: 1) whether their behavior is characterized by enhanced or diminished model-based behavior, 2) the domain specificity of any abnormalities by comparing learning in a food-specific context as well as in a monetary context, and 3) whether impairments are secondary to starvation by comparing learning before and after initial treatment. Across all conditions, individuals with AN showed an impairment in model-based, but not model-free, learning, suggesting a general and persistent contribution of habitual over goal-directed control, across domains and timepoints.","/content/10.1101/19002089v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002089v1.full.pdf","2019-07-14","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Ethnicity and Acculturation: Asian American Substance Use from Early Adolescence to Mature Adulthood","Research on Asian American substance use has, to date, been limited by monolithic conceptions of Asian identity, inadequate attention to acculturative process, and a disproportionate focus on the adolescent developmental period. This study addresses these limitations by longitudinally investigating disparities in substance use, including tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and a range of illicit drugs, from early adolescence (~15) into mature adulthood (~40) using five waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Ample statistical power (Asian N=1583, obs=7915) allowed disaggregated study of the most populous Asian American ethnic groups including Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Asian Indian, and Japanese, as well as subjects identifying as multiple Asian ethnicities (i.e., multiethnic) and multiracial Asians. The potential mediating role of acculturative factors (e.g., nativity, parental nativity, familial language use) on the observed ethnic disparities was also examined. Results indicate significant variation across Asian ethnicities, with the lowest probability of substance use among Chinese and Vietnamese, and the highest among multiethnic and multiracial Asians. Acculturative factors (e.g., English language use, nativity) were strongly associated with increased substance use, and mediated some, but not all, of the observed ethnic disparities. This study demonstrates how the model minority stereotype masks significant ethnic disparities in Asian American substance use and argues that a considerable proportion of the observed ethnic variation appears to be due to diverse family ties speeding transition toward US cultural norms, away from the relatively salubrious norms of Asian nations of origin.","/content/10.1101/19002048v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002048v1.full.pdf","2019-07-14","Epidemiology

"Quantification of Conflicts of Interest in an Online Point-of-Care Clinical Support Website","Online medical reference websites are utilized by health care providers to enhance their education and decision making. However, these resources may not adequately reveal pharmaceutical-author interactions and their potential conflicts of interest (CoIs). This investigation: 1) evaluated the correspondence of two well-utilized CoI databases: the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments (CMSOP) and ProPublica Dollars for Docs (PDD) and 2) quantified CoIs among authors of a publically available point of care clinical support website.  Two data sources were used: the hundred most common drugs and the top fifty causes of death. These topics were entered into a freely available database. The authors (N = 139) were then input into CMSOP and PDD and compensation and number of payment were determined for 2013-2015. The subset of highly compensated authors that also reported quote: Nothing to disclose, unquote, were further examined. There was a high degree of similarity between CMSOP and PDD for compensation (R2 > 0.998) and payment number (R2 > 0.992). The amount received was 1.4% higher in CMSOP ($4,059,194) than in PDD ($4,002,891). The articles where the authors had received the greatest compensation were in neurology (Parkinsons Disease = $1,810,032), oncology (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia = $616,727), and endocrinology (Type I Diabetes = $377,388). Two authors reporting Nothing to disclose received appreciable and potentially relevant compensation. CMSOP and PDD produced almost identical results. CoIs were common among authors but self-reporting may be an inadequate reporting mechanism. Recommendations are offered for improving the CoI transparency of pharmaceutical-author interactions in point-of-care electronic resources.","/content/10.1101/19001859v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001859v1.full.pdf","2019-07-14","Medical Ethics

"Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like?","Introduction: Typhoid fever is one of the most common bacterial causes of acute febrile illness in the developing world, with an estimated 10.9 million new cases and 116.8 thousand deaths in 2017. Typhoid point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests are widely used but have poor sensitivity and specificity, resulting in antibiotic overuse that has led to the emergence and spread of multidrug resistant strains. With recent advances in typhoid surveillance and detection, this is the ideal time to produce a target product profile (TPP) that guides product development and ensure that a next-generation test meets the needs of users in the resource-limited settings where typhoid is endemic.
Methods: A structured literature review was conducted to develop a draft TPP for a next-generation typhoid diagnostic test with minimal and optimal desired characteristics for 36 test parameters. The TPP was refined using feedback collected from a Delphi survey of key stakeholders in clinical medicine, microbiology, diagnostics and public and global health.
Results: A next-generation typhoid diagnostic test should improve patient management through the diagnosis and treatment of infection with acute Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi or Paratyphi with a sensitivity =90% and specificity =95%. The test would ideally be used at the lowest level of the healthcare system in settings without a reliable power or water supply and provide results in less than 15 minutes at a cost of <$1.00 USD.
Conclusion: This report outlines the first comprehensive TPP for typhoid fever and is intended to guide the development of a next-generation typhoid diagnostic test. An accurate POC test will reduce the morbidity and mortality of typhoid fever through rapid diagnosis and treatment and will have the greatest impact in reducing antimicrobial resistance if it is combined with diagnostics for other causes of acute febrile illness in a treatment algorithm.","/content/10.1101/19001958v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001958v1.full.pdf","2019-07-14","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Actigraphic Screening for Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder","Background: The patients suffering of the rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are in high risk of developing a neurodegenerative disorder, most frequently from the group of alpha-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) or multiple system atrophy (MSA). The definitive diagnosis of RBD is based on polysomnographic  investigation. Actigraphy is much easier to perform and reflects condition in patient's home environment.
The aims: The aim of this study was to find suitable biomarkers for RBD, which can be detectable by actigraphic recording.
Methods: High resolution actigraphic recording (MotionWatch, CamNtech ltd.) and confirming polysomnographic recording was performed on 45 RBD patients, 30 patients with other sleep-related motor disorders and 20 healthy controls. Each individual file was analysed by software testing for amount of sleep (MotionWare 1.1.20) and secondly for periodic motor activity (PLMS analysis 1.0.16). The 13-item patient self-rating RBD screening questionnaire (RBD-SQ) translated to Czech language was also used for screening purposes. We used an RBD-SQ score of five points as a positive test result, as suggested by the original publication of the scale.
Results: When using the actigraphic sleep detection, we encountered significant differences mostly on non-dominant hand, related to sleep fragmentation - most notably increased percentage of Short immobile bouts (47.0% vs. 28.0%, p<0.0001), increased Fragmentation index (72.5 vs. 40.7, p<0.0001) and decreased percentage of Sleep efficiency (72.1% vs. 86.8%, p<0.0001)in RBD subjects compared to other sleep disorders and controls. When analyzing periodic motor activity, we also found surprisingly more periodic hand movements (p=0.028, corrected for multiple testing), but differences on lower extremities using either measurement were not significant. The discrimination function based on RBD-SQ and Short immobile bouts % could allocate correctly the RBD status in 87.6% of cases with Wilks Lambda 0.435 and p<0.0001.
Conclusion: In our single-center study in patients from the Czech population, we found that actigraphic recording from upper extremities shows consistently more prominent sleep fragmentation in RBD patients compared to other sleep diagnoses or healthy controls. Actigraphy may be useful in broader screening for RBD.","/content/10.1101/19001867v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001867v1.full.pdf","2019-07-14","Neurology

"Effects of vitamin D supplementation and seasonality on circulating cytokines in adolescents: analysis of data from a feasibility trial in Mongolia.","Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in human populations and has been linked to immune dysfunction. Here we explored the effects of cholecalciferol supplementation on circulating cytokines in severely vitamin D deficient (blood 25(OH)D3 << 30 nmol/L) adolescents aged 12-15 from Mongolia. The study included 28 children receiving 800 IU daily cholecalciferol for 6 months spanning winter and spring, and 30 children receiving placebo during the same period. The levels of 25(OH)D3 were assessed at baseline, three and six months. Twenty-one cytokines were measured in serum at baseline and at six months. The median blood 25(OH)D3 concentration at baseline was 13.7 nmol/L (IQR=10.0-21.7). Supplementation tripled blood 25(OH)D3 levels (p<0.001) and reversed the direction of change for most cytokines (16/21, 86%). Supplementation was associated with elevated interleukin (IL)-6 (p=0.043). The placebo group had reduced MIP-1a (p=0.007) and IL-8 (p=0.034) at six months. These findings suggest that cholecalciferol supplementation and seasonality have a measurable impact on circulating cytokines in adolescents, identifying chemokines as potentially important biomarkers of vitamin D status in this population.","/content/10.1101/19001842v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001842v1.full.pdf","2019-07-14","Nutrition

"Design of a computer model for the identification of adolescent swimmers with low BMD","Objectives: This paper aims to elaborate a decision tree for the early detection of adolescent swimmers at risk of presenting low bone mineral density (BMD), based on easily measurable fitness and performance variables.
Methods: Bone mineral status of 78 adolescent swimmers was determined using DXA scans at the hip and subtotal body. Participants also underwent physical fitness (upper and lower body strength, running speed and cardiovascular endurance) and performance (swimming history, speed and ranking) assessments. A gradient boosting machine regression tree was built in order to predict BMD of the swimmers and to further develop a simpler individual decision tree, using a subtotal BMD height-adjusted Z-score of -1 as threshold value.
Results: The predicted BMD using the gradient boosted model was strongly correlated with the actual BMD values obtained from DXA (r=0.960, p<0.0001) with a root mean squared error of 0.034 g/cm2. According to a simple decision tree, that showed a 73.9% of classification accuracy, swimmers with a body mass index (BMI) lower than 17 kg/m2 or a handgrip strength inferior to 43kg with the sum of both arms could be at higher risk of having low BMD.
Conclusion: Easily measurable fitness variables (BMI and handgrip strength) could be used for the early detection of adolescent swimmers at risk of suffering from low BMD. The presented decision tree could be used in training settings to determine the necessity of further BMD assessments.","/content/10.1101/19001792v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001792v1.full.pdf","2019-07-13","Sports Medicine

"Sitagliptin decreases visceral fat and blood glucose in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome","Context: Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have decreased growth hormone (GH), which can increase visceral adiposity (VAT) and impair vascular function.  GH releasing hormone, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) substrate, stimulates GH secretion.  
Objective: We tested the hypothesis that DPP4 inhibition increases GH and improves glucose levels and vascular function in women with PCOS. 
Methods: Eighteen women with PCOS participated in a double-blinded, cross-over study. They received sitagliptin 100 mg vs. placebo daily for one month separated by an eight-week washout.  During each treatment, women underwent a 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), assessment of vascular function and body composition.  Overnight GH secretion was assessed via venous sampling every 10 minutes for 12 hours and analyzed using an automated deconvolution algorithm.  
Results: During OGTT, sitagliptin increased GLP-1 (p<0.001), early insulin secretion (from mean insulinogenic index 1.9Â±1.2 (SD) to 3.2Â± 3.1; p=0.02) and decreased peak glucose (mean -17.2 mg/dL [95% CI -27.7, -6.6]; p<0.01).  At one month, sitagliptin decreased VAT (from 1141.9Â±700.7 to 1055.1Â±710.1 g; p=0.02) but did not affect vascular function.  Sitagliptin increased GH half-life (from 13.9Â±3.6 to 17.0Â±6.8 min, N=16; p=0.04) and interpulse interval (from 53.2Â±20.0 to 77.3Â±38.2 min, N=16; p<0.05) but did not increase mean overnight GH (p=0.92 vs. placebo).  
Conclusions: Sitagliptin decreased the maximal glucose response to OGTT and VAT.  Sitagliptin did not increase overnight GH but increased GH half-life and the interpulse interval.  

Precis: Sitagliptin improved body composition and blood glucoses following oral glucose load in women with PCOS. Sitagliptin potentiated GH half-life but did not increase overnight GH levels.","/content/10.1101/19001685v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001685v1.full.pdf","2019-07-13","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Prediagnostic breast milk DNA methylation alterations in women who develop breast cancer","Background: Prior candidate gene studies have shown tumor suppressor DNA methylation in breast milk related with history of breast biopsy, an established risk factor for breast cancer. To further establish the utility of breast milk as a tissue-specific biospecimen for investigations of breast carcinogenesis we measured genome-wide DNA methylation in breast milk from women with and without a diagnosis of breast cancer in two independent cohorts.
Methods: DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina HumanMethylation450k in 87 breast milk samples. After quality control, 368,171 autosomal CpG loci were analyzed. Cell type proportion estimates from RefFreeCellMix were calculated and adjusted for in this Epigenome Wide Association Study using linear mixed effects models adjusted for history of breast biopsy, age, time of delivery, cell type proportion estimates, array chip, and subject as random effect. 
Results: Epigenome-wide analyses identified 58 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis in the prospectively collected milk samples from the  breast that would develop cancer compared with women without a diagnosis of breast cancer (q-value < 0.05). Nearly all CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis were hypomethylated in cases compared with controls, and were enriched for CpG islands. In addition, inferred repeat element methylation was lower in breast milk DNA from cases compared to controls, and cases exhibited increased estimated epigenetic mitotic tick rate as well as DNA methylation age compared with controls. 
Conclusion: Breast milk has utility as a biospecimen for prospective assessment of disease risk, for understanding the underlying molecular basis of breast cancer risk factors, and improving primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer.","/content/10.1101/19001925v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001925v1.full.pdf","2019-07-12","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Stem Cell Transplantation Patients and Situational Meaning: A Prospective and Longitudinal View","Background: Though there is thorough examination of psychosocial issues in SCT, there are few longitudinal studies examining the meaning SCT patients attribute to their treatment. Objective: The object of this study was to examine change in situational appraisal over time, and to explore potential modifiers of that change. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study of 146 autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) patients at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) was conducted to measure situational appraisal over time as per the meaning making model of Park and Folkman (1997) utilizing the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R; Moss-Morris et al., 2002). Participants were administered the instrument prior to transplant, at one, three and six months, and at one-year post-transplant. Results: Change over time was seen in different diagnoses, donor types, reduced intensity and standard pre-transplant preparative regimens, and between the two major ethnic groups (Caucasian and African American) studied.  Many of the patient subgroups had statistically significant findings in measures of illness attribution. Conclusion: The appraisals SCT patients made of their situation in treatment revealed a complex process of appraisal affected by illness, treatment and patient characteristics including disease type, donor type, race, and pre-transplant regimen.","/content/10.1101/19001529v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001529v1.full.pdf","2019-07-12","Transplantation

"Why so many significant Phase 3 results in clinical trials?","Planning and execution of clinical research and publication of results should conform to the highest ethical standards, given that human lives are at stake. However, economic incentives can generate conflicts of interest for investigators, who may be inclined to withhold unfavorable results or even tamper with the data. Analyzing p-values reported to the ClinicalTrials.gov registry with two different methodologies, we find suspicious patterns only for results from trials conducted by smaller industry sponsors, with presumably less reputation at stake. First, a density discontinuity test reveals an upward jump at the classical threshold for statistical significance for Phase 3 results by small industry sponsors, suggesting some selective reporting. Second, we find an excess mass of significant results in Phase 3 compared to Phase 2. However, we can explain almost completely this excess mass for large industry sponsors, once we account for the incentives to selectively continue research through a novel technique linking trials across phases. In contrast, for trials sponsored by small pharmaceutical companies, selective continuation of trials economizing on research costs only explains one third of the increase in the number of significant results from Phase 2 to Phase 3. The different pattern depending on the type of sponsor suggests that reputational concerns can mitigate the short-run economic incentives that undermine integrity in reporting results of clinical research.","/content/10.1101/19001495v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001495v1.full.pdf","2019-07-12","Health Economics

"The fecal microbiome in diverticulitis and asymptomatic diverticulosis: A case-control study in the US","Objective:  The intestinal microbiota are hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of diverticulitis.  We compared fecal microbial communities in individuals with diverticulitis to those with uncomplicated diverticulosis. Methods:  We used 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to assess and compare the microbiota composition of fecal samples from 10 patients presenting with acute diverticulitis (cases) and 10 controls with asymptomatic diverticulosis matched on age and sex.  Results:   We found differences in the distribution of relative abundances of bacterial phyla and genera in diverticulitis cases versus diverticulosis controls. At the phyla level, Verrucomicrobia was more abundant on average in diverticulitis cases at the time of diagnosis than in diverticulosis controls (p=0.07).   Univariate analysis identified a significant increase in the genera Coriobacteria (p=0.050), Anaerotruncus (0.046), Subdoliganulum (p=0.034), Marvinabryantia (p=0.006), and Akkermansia (p=0.04), and a decrease in Barnesiella (p=0.035) and Coprococcus (p=0.035) in diverticulitis cases at the time of diagnosis compared to diverticulosis controls.  However, after correction for multiple comparisons, these differences were no longer significant. Partial least squares discriminant analysis on all microbial genera showed partial separation of diverticulitis cases at diagnosis and diverticulosis controls.  The microbial alpha diversity was higher in diverticulitis cases at time of diagnosis vs controls but this was not significant (Shannon diversity index 7.4Â±0.6 vs 6.8Â±0.7, p=0.08).

"Post-Exposure Effects of Vaccines on Infectious Diseases","Many available vaccines have demonstrated post-exposure effectiveness, but no published systematic reviews have synthesized these findings. We searched the PubMed database for clinical trials and observational human studies concerning the post-exposure vaccination effects, targeting infections with an FDA-licensed vaccine plus dengue, hepatitis E, malaria, and tick borne encephalitis, which have licensed vaccines outside of the U.S. Studies concerning animal models, serologic testing, and pipeline vaccines were excluded. Eligible studies were evaluated by definition of exposure, and their attempt at distinguishing pre- and post-exposure effects was rated on a scale of 1-4. We screened 4518 articles and ultimately identified 14 clinical trials and 31 observational studies for this review, amounting to 45 eligible articles spanning 7 of the 28 vaccine-preventable diseases. For secondary attack rate, this body of evidence found the following medians for post-exposure vaccination effectiveness: hepatitis A: 85% (IQR: 28; 5 sources), hepatitis B: 85% (IQR: 22; 5 sources), measles: 83% (IQR: 21; 8 sources), varicella: 67% (IQR: 48; 9 sources), smallpox: 45% (IQR: 39; 4 sources), and mumps: 38% (IQR: 7; 2 sources). For case fatality proportions resulting from rabies and smallpox, the vaccine efficacies had medians of 100% (IQR: 0; 6 sources) and 63% (IQR: 50; 8 sources) post-exposure. Although mainly used for preventive measures, many available vaccines can modify or preclude disease if administered after exposure. This post-exposure effectiveness could be important to consider during vaccine trials and while developing new vaccines.","/content/10.1101/19001396v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001396v1.full.pdf","2019-07-12","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Epigenetic field cancerization in breast cancer using subject-matched tumor, ipsilateral-normal, and contralateral-normal tissues","Background: Emerging work has demonstrated that histologically normal (non-tumor) tissue adjacent to breast tumor tissue shows evidence of molecular alterations related to tumorigenesis, referred to as field cancerization effects. Although changes in DNA methylation are known to occur early in breast carcinogenesis and the landscape of breast tumor DNA methylation is profoundly altered compared with normal tissue, there have been limited efforts to identify DNA methylation field cancerization effects in histologically normal breast tissue adjacent to tumor. 
Methods: Matched tumor, histologically normal tissue of the ipsilateral breast (ipsilateral-normal), and histologically normal tissue of the contralateral breast (contralateral-normal) were obtained from nine women undergoing bilateral mastectomy. Laser capture microdissection was used to select breast epithelial cells from normal tissues, and neoplastic cells from tumor specimens for genome-scale measures of DNA methylation with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array. 
Results: We identified substantially more CpG loci that were differentially methylated between contralateral-normal breast and tumor tissue (63,271 CpG loci q < 0.01), than between ipsilateral-normal tissue and tumor (38,346 CpG loci q < 0.01). In addition, we identified differential methylation in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue (9,562 CpG loci p < 0.01). Hypomethylated loci in ipsilateral normal relative to contralateral were significantly enriched for breast cancer-relevant transcription factor binding sites including those for ESR1, FoxA1, and GATA3. Hypermethylated loci in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue were significantly enriched for CpG island shore regions. 
Conclusions: Our results indicate that early hypermethylation events in breast carcinogenesis are more likely to occur in the regions immediately surrounding CpG islands than CpG islands per se, reflecting a field effect of the tumor on surrounding histologically normal tissue. This work offers an opportunity to focus investigations of early DNA methylation alterations in breast carcinogenesis and potentially develop epigenetic biomarkers of disease risk.","/content/10.1101/19002014v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002014v1.full.pdf","2019-07-12","Epidemiology

"Detection of malaria parasites in dried human blood spots using mid-infrared spectroscopy and logistic regression analysis","Background: Epidemiological surveys of malaria currently rely on microscopy, polymerase chain reaction assays (PCR) or rapid diagnostic test kits for Plasmodium infections (RDTs). This study shows that mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning could constitute an alternative method for rapid malaria screening, directly from dried human blood spots.

Methods: Filter papers containing dried blood spots (DBS) were obtained from a cross-sectional malaria survey in twelve wards in south-eastern Tanzania in 2018/19. The DBS were scanned using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer to obtain high-resolution MIR spectra in the range, 4000 cm-1 to 500 cm-1. The spectra were cleaned to compensate for atmospheric water vapor and CO2 interference bands and used to train different classification algorithms to distinguish between malaria-positive and malaria-negative DBS papers based on PCR test results as reference. The analysis considered 296 individuals, including 123 PCR-confirmed malaria-positives and 173 negatives. Model training was done using 80% of the dataset, after which the best-fitting model was optimized by bootstrapping of 80/20 train/test stratified splits. The trained models were evaluated by predicting Plasmodium falciparum positivity in the 20% validation set of DBS. 

Results: Logistic regression was the best-performing model. Considering PCR as reference, the models attained overall accuracies of 92% for predicting P. falciparum infections (specificity = 91.7%; sensitivity = 92.8%) and 85% for predicting mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. ovale (specificity = 85%, sensitivity = 85%) in the field-collected specimen.

Conclusion: These results demonstrate that mid-infrared spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning (MIR-ML) could be used to screen for malaria parasites in dried human blood spots. The approach could have potential for rapid and high-throughput screening of Plasmodium infections in both non-clinical settings (e.g. field surveys) and clinical settings (diagnosis to aid case management). However, full utility will require further advances in classification algorithms, field validation of this technology in other study sites and an in-depth evaluation of the biological basis of the observed test results. Training the models on larger datasets could also improve specificity and sensitivity of the technique. The MIR-ML spectroscopy system is robust, low-cost, and requires minimum maintenance.","/content/10.1101/19001206v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001206v1.full.pdf","2019-07-12","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Higher energy requirement during weight-loss maintenance on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet: secondary analyses from a randomized controlled feeding study","Background: Longer-term feeding studies suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet increases energy expenditure, consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity. However, the validity of methodology utilized in these studies, involving doubly-labeled water, has been questioned. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary energy requirement for weight-loss maintenance is higher on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet. Methods: The study reports secondary outcomes and exploratory analyses from a feeding study in which the primary outcome was total energy expenditure. After attaining a mean Run-in weight loss of 10.5%, 164 adults with pre-weight-loss BMI of =25 were randomly assigned to Test diets containing Low (20%), Moderate (40%) or High (60%) carbohydrate for 20 weeks. Calorie content of Test diets was adjusted to maintain individual body weight within 2 kg of the post-weight-loss value. In analyses by Intention-to-Treat (ITT, study completers, n=148) and Per Protocol (PP, those achieving the weight-loss maintenance target, n=110), we compared estimated energy requirement from 10 to 20 weeks on the Test diets using ANCOVA. Insulin secretion was assessed pre-weight-loss as insulin concentration 30 minutes following 75 grams oral glucose (Insulin-30). Results: Estimated energy requirement was higher in the Low vs High group by models involving ITT (ranging from 181 [CI 8-353] to 223 [40-406] kcal/d; P=;0.04) and PP (ranging from 245 [43-446] to 295 [91-499] kcal/d; P=;0.02). This difference remained significant in sensitivity analyses accounting for change in adiposity and possible non-adherence. In observational analyses, pre-weight loss Insulin-30 predicted adverse change in body composition following weight loss. Conclusions: Energy requirement was higher on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet during weight-loss maintenance, commensurate with total energy expenditure. These data are consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model and lend qualified support for the validity of the doubly-labeled water method with diets varying in macronutrient composition.","/content/10.1101/19001248v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001248v1.full.pdf","2019-07-11","Nutrition

"Predicting Residual Function in Hemodialysis and Hemodiafiltration : A Population Kinetic, Decision Analytic Approach","In this study, we introduce a novel framework for the estimation of residual renal function (RRF), based on the population compartmental kinetic behavior of Beta 2 Microglobulin (B2M) and its dialytic removal. Using this model, we simulated a large cohort of patients with various levels of RRF receiving either conventional high-flux hemodialysis or on-line hemodiafiltration. These simulations were used to estimate a novel population kinetic (PK) equation for RRF (PK-RRF) that was validated in an external public dataset of real patients. We assessed the performance of the resulting equation(s) against their ability to estimate urea clearance using cross-validation. Our equations derived entirely from computer simulations and advanced statistical modeling, and had extremely high discrimination (AUC 0.888 - 0.909) when applied to a human dataset of measurements of RRF. A clearance-based equation that utilized pre and post dialysis B2M measurements, patient weight, treatment duration and ultrafiltration had higher discrimination than an equation previously derived in humans. Furthermore, the derived equations appeared to have higher clinical usefulness as assessed by Decision Curve Analysis, potentially supporting decisions that for individualizing dialysis frequency in patients with preserved RRF.","/content/10.1101/19001222v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001222v2.full.pdf","2019-07-09","Nephrology

"Molecular profiling of neonatal dried blood spots reveals changes in innate and adaptive immunity following fetal inflammatory response","The fetal inflammatory response (FIR) increases the risk of perinatal brain injury, particularly in extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, <<28 weeks of gestation). One of the mechanisms contributing to such a risk is a postnatal intermittent or sustained systemic inflammation (ISSI) following FIR. The link between prenatal and postnatal systemic inflammation is supported by the presence of well-established inflammatory biomarkers in the umbilical cord and peripheral blood. However, the extent of molecular changes contributing to this association is unknown. Using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics, we profiled the transcriptome and proteome of archived neonatal dried blood spot (DBS) specimens from 21 ELGANs. Comparing FIR-affected and unaffected ELGANs, we identified 783 gene and 27 protein expression changes of 50% magnitude or more, and an experiment-wide significance level below 5% false discovery rate. These expression changes confirm the robust postnatal activation of the innate immune system in FIR-affected ELGANs and reveal an impairment of their adaptive immunity. In turn, the altered pathways provide clues about the molecular mechanisms triggering ISSI after FIR, and the onset of perinatal brain injury.","/content/10.1101/19000109v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000109v2.full.pdf","2019-07-09","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Reduced survival in COPD patients who received long-term oxygen therapy without meeting prescription criteria: a preliminary study","Background: Randomized clinical trials have provided clear evidence that long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) increases life expectancy in severely hypoxemic COPD patients. However, in real-life settings, in global COPD cohorts, a paradoxical 2-3-fold increased risk of death has been reported in patients under LTOT. This discrepancy could be explained by a subgroup of patients under LTOT who do not meet the current guidelines and for whom LTOT would be associated with poor prognosis. This retrospective study of a global COPD cohort therefore sought to: (1) determine if a subgroup of patients under LTOT without severe hypoxemia could be distinguished, and (2) compare the mortality risk according to hypoxemia severity and LTOT prescription. Method: The sample was taken from a database (NCT02055885) on 191 stable COPD patients (age: 65.1Â±9.8 years, 85 women) admitted for a pulmonary rehabilitation program between 2009 and 2012 and followed until 1 January 2018. Uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to examine the associations between clinical characteristics (age, sex, blood gases, etc.), LTOT according to PaO2 level, and mortality.
Results: Forty patients (21%) were under LTOT at PR entry despite not meeting the O2 prescription criteria. Patients under LTOT had a nearly 2-fold higher mortality risk adjusted by covariates (HRmultivariate=1.83; p=0.009). Furthermore, the higher mortality risk under LTOT was specific to the patients under LTOT without severe hypoxemia (HRmultivariate=2.39; p=0.04). Conclusion: The association between LTOT and mortality might be attributed to a subgroup under LTOT despite not/no longer meeting the LTOT criteria. Further studies are needed to identify the physiological basis of this phenomenon.","/content/10.1101/19000760v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000760v1.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Respiratory Medicine

"Oncofetal Protein Cripto-1 in a new clinical role: a potential tumor marker for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.","PURPOSE: CR-1 (CR-1) is an oncofetal protein with its role as a key factor in early process of carcinoma has been evaluated in cases of various cancers. However, very few studies have reported its role in oral cancers, which is the sixth most common cancer around the world, particularly with high prevalence in developing countries. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most predominant (90%) of all the histological types of oral cancer. Late detection, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, is mainly attributed to non-availability of a suitable biomarker for the disease. In the present pilot study we have evaluated the role of soluble CR-1, in serum as a potential tumor marker for OSCC. METHODS: CR-1 was estimated using sandwich ELISA in serum samples of 50 biopsy proven OSCC patients (pre and post treatment) along with age and gender matched healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry was also done in corresponding tumor tissue sections to check the expression of CR-1. RESULTS: Pre-treatment CR-1 was found to be 2.25 fold higher in serum of OSCC patients as compared to control (p<0.0001***), which was reduced to 1.6 folds post treatment (p=0.0006***). CR-1 levels were comparatively higher in early stage of disease. Upon IHC 80% of the cases were found to be positive for CR-1. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that serum levels of CR-1 are elevated in patients of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma, which decrease post treatment. Also, the association of expression of protein with tumor progression predicts CR-1 as a molecule that can be further evaluated as a potential tumor maker in OSCC.","/content/10.1101/19000950v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000950v1.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Oncology

"Plasma Itaconate elevation following successful cDMARD treatment in early rheumatoid arthritis patients elucidates disease activity associated macrophage activation","Objective. To characterize changes in the plasma metabolic profile in newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients upon commencement of conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (cDMARD) therapy. Methods. Plasma samples collected in an early RA randomized strategy study  (NCT00920478) that compared clinical (DAS) disease activity assessment with musculoskeletal ultrasound assessment (MSUS) to drive treatment decisions were subjected to untargeted metabolomic analysis. Metabolic profiles were collected at pre- and 3 months post commencement of non-biologic cDMARD. Metabolites that changed in association with changes in the DAS44 score were identified at the 3 month timepoint. Results. A total of ten metabolites exhibited a clear correlation with reduction in DAS44 score following cDMARD commencement, particularly itaconate, its derived anhydride and a derivative of itaconate coA.  Increasing itaconate correlated with improved DAS44 score and decreasing levels of CRP. Conclusion. cDMARD treatment effects invoke consistent changes in plasma detectable metabolites, that in turn implicate clinical disease activity with  macrophages.

"Antihypertensive medications as repurposed treatments for mood disorders: analysis of linked healthcare data for 1.8 million patients","Background: Recent work suggests that antihypertensive medications may be useful as repurposed treatments for mood disorders. Using large-scale linked healthcare data we investigated whether certain classes of antihypertensive, such as angiotensin antagonists and calcium channel blockers, may have potential as repurposed treatments for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder.
Method: Two cohorts of patients treated with antihypertensives were identified from Scottish prescribing (2009-2016) and hospital admission (1981-2016) records. Eligibility for cohort membership was determined by receipt of a minimum of four prescriptions for antihypertensives within a 12-month window. One treatment cohort (n=538,730) included patients with no previous history of mood disorder, whereas the other (n=262,278) included those who did. Both cohorts were matched by age, sex and area deprivation to untreated comparators. Associations between antihypertensive treatment and new-onset MDD or bipolar episodes were investigated using Cox regression. 
Results: For patients without a history of mood disorder, antihypertensives were associated with increased risk of new-onset MDD. This was most marked for beta-blockers, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.68 (95%CI 2.45-2.92). For angiotensin antagonist monotherapy, the HR for new-onset MDD was 1.17 (95%CI 1.04-1.31). Some classes of antihypertensive were associated with protection against bipolar disorder, particularly angiotensin antagonists (HR 0.46; 95%CI 0.30-0.70). For patients with a past history of mood disorders, all classes of antihypertensives were associated with increased risk of future episodes of MDD.
Conclusions: There was no evidence that antihypertensive medications prevented new episodes of MDD but angiotensin antagonists may represent a novel treatment avenue for bipolar disorder.","/content/10.1101/19001719v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001719v1.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Automated interpretation of the coronary angioscopy with deep convolutional neural networks","Objective: Coronary angioscopy (CAS) is a useful modality to assess the atherosclerotic changes, but the interpretation of the obtained images requires expert knowledge. In this study, we showed the potential usage of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for the diagnostic prediction and image synthesis.
Methods: 107 images from 47 patients, who underwent coronary angioscopy in our hospital between February 2014 and October 2017, and 864 images, selected from 142 MEDLINE-indexed articles published between April 2000 and April 2019, were used for the modeling. First, we developed a prediction model for the angioscopic findings. Next, we made a standard generative adversarial networks (GAN) model to simulate the CAS images. Finally, we tried control the output images according to the angioscopic findings with conditional GAN architecture.
Results: For both yellow color (YC) grade and neointimal coverage (NC) grade, we could observe strong and significant correlations between the true grades and the predicted values (YC grade, average r value = 0.80 Â± 0.02, p-value <0.001; NC grade, average r value = 0.73 Â± 0.02, p < 0.001). The binary classification model for the red thrombus yielded 0.71 Â± 0.03 F1-score. The average Inception score was 3.57 Â± 0.06 in the images obtained from the standard GAN model. In the conditional GAN model, there were significant positive correlations between given values and the expert's diagnosis in YC grade and NC grade.
Conclusion: DCNN is useful in diagnostic prediction as well as in generating images from the findings in CAS.","/content/10.1101/19001693v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001693v1.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Impact of a regional educational advertising campaign on harm perceptions of e-cigarettes, prevalence of e-cigarette use, and quit attempts among smokers","Background: We evaluated how effective an advertising campaign that was piloted by Cancer Research UK in January/February 2018 was at promoting quit attempts by increasing awareness of the relative harms of e-cigarettes compared with smoking. Methods: Adults (=16 years, n = 2217) living in Greater Manchester (campaign region) and Yorkshire & Humber and the North East of England (control regions) completed cross-sectional surveys immediately before and after the campaign period. Surveys measured socio-demographics, perceptions and use of e-cigarettes, and motivation and attempts to quit smoking. We tested interactions between time (pre, post) and region (campaign, control). Results: 36.7% (95% CI 33.0% - 40.6%) of those in the intervention region recognised the campaign. In the general population, interactions were non-significant for all outcomes except for perception of e-cigarettes as effective cessation aids, with smaller increases from pre- to post-campaign in the campaign (49.9% to 54.0%) compared with the control region (40.5% to 55.0%; OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 - 0.98). Among smokers, motivation to quit increased in the intervention region (44.0% to 48.0%) but decreased in the control region (40.5% to 21.5%; OR = 2.97, 95% CI 1.25 - 7.16), with no other significant differences between regions over time. A Bayesian analysis confirmed that non-significant results were inconclusive. Conclusions: Compared with the control region, the campaign was associated with an increase in smokers' motivation to quit but a smaller increase in adults' perception of e-cigarettes as an effective cessation aid. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether the campaign affected other outcomes.","/content/10.1101/19001610v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001610v1.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Public and Global Health

"Proximal and distal factors predicting timely initiation of breastfeeding in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: In Ethiopia, the current coverage of timely initiation of breast feeding (TIBF) has fallen short of the National Health Sector Transformation Plan 2016â€“2020, National Nutrition Program 2016-2020 and WHO global target. This calls for the need to assess relevant proximal and distal factors that affect the rate of TIBF in Ethiopia. Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association between TIBF and educational status, household income, marital status, media exposure, and parity in Ethiopia. Methods: Databases used were PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, CINAHL and WHO Global health library, and key terms were searched using interactive searching syntax. It was also supplemented by manual searching. Observational studies published between September 2000 and March 2019 were included. The methodological quality of studies was examined using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cross-sectional studies. Data were extracted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) data extraction tool. To obtain the pooled odds ratio (OR), extracted data were fitted in a random-effects meta-analysis model. Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using Cochran Q test, tau2, and I2 statistics. Additional analysis conducted includes Jackknife sensitivity analysis, cumulative meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis. Results: Out of 553 studies retrieved, 25 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Almost all studies were conducted on mothers with newborn less than 23 months. Maternal educational status (OR = 1.82; p < 0.001; 95% CI = 1.35 - 2.45; I2 = 84.96%), paternal educational status (OR = 2.72; p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.49 - 4.97 I2 = 62.50%), income (OR = 1.16; p = 0.002; 95% CI = 1.05 - 1.27; I2 = 0.00%), marital status (OR = 1.39; p = 0.001; 95% CI = 1.14 - 1.69; I2 = 9.17%) and parity (OR = 1.39; p = 0.01; 95% CI = 1.07 - 1.81; I2 = 74.43%) were found to be significantly associated with TIBF. We also observed a direct dose-response relationship of TIBF with educational status and income. Conclusions: Proximal and distal factors significantly predicting TIBF practice in Ethiopia, which needs integrated intervention by health professionals and healthcare policymakers. Health education, counselling and peer education targeting parents at antenatal and postnatal periods are needed. It is also relevant to improve the economic power of women and promote gender equality.","/content/10.1101/19000497v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000497v2.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Nutrition

"Cluster analysis successfully identifies clinically meaningful knee valgus moment patterns: Frequency of early peaks reflects sex-specific ACL injury incidence","Background: Biomechanical studies of ACL injury risk factors report heterogenous results, analyze only a fraction of the data, and do not analyze data in accordance with the injury mechanism. Extracting a peak value of relevance to ACL injuries is challenging due to differences in the relative timing of the peak value. Aims/Hypotheses: The aim was to cluster analyze the knee valgus moment time series curve shape in the early stance phase. We hypothesized that 1a) There would be few discrete curve shapes, 1b) there would be an early peak pattern, 2a) youth athletes of both sexes would show similar frequencies of early peaks, 2b) adolescent girls would have higher early peak frequencies. Methods: N=213 (39% boys) youth soccer and team handball athletes (phase 1) and N=35 (45% boys) with 5 year follow-up data (phase 2) were recorded performing a change of direction task with 3D motion analysis and a force plate. The time series of the first 30% of stance phase were cluster analyzed based on Euclidean distances in two steps; shape-based main clusters with a transformed time series, and magnitude based sub-clusters with body weight normalized time series. Group differences (sex, phase) in curve shape frequencies, and shape-magnitude frequencies were tested with chi-squared test. Results: 6 discrete shape-clusters and 14 magnitude based sub-clusters were formed. Phase 1 boys had higher frequencies of early peaks than phase 1 girls (38% vs 25% respectively, P<0.001 for full test). Phase 2 girls had higher frequencies of early peaks than phase 2 boys (42% vs 21% respectively, P<0.001 for full test). Conclusions: Cluster analysis can reveal different patterns of curve shapes in biomechanical data. The early peak shape is relatable to the ACL injury mechanism as the timing of its peak moment is consistent with the timing of injury. Higher frequency of early peaks demonstrated by Phase 2 girls is consistent with their higher incidence of ACL injury.","/content/10.1101/19001511v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001511v1.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Sports Medicine

"Phenome-wide association study of TTR and RBP4 genes in 361,194 individuals reveals novel insights in the genetics of hereditary and senile systemic amyloidoses","Transthyretin (TTR) gene has a causal role in a hereditary form of amyloidosis (ATTRm) and is potentially involved in the risk of senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). To understand the genetics of ATTRm and SSA, we conducted a phenome-wide association study of TTR gene in 361,194 participants of European descent testing coding and non-coding variants. Among the 382 clinically-relevant phenotypes tested, TTR non-coding variants were associated with 26 phenotypic traits after multiple testing correction. These included signs related to both ATTRm and SSA such as chronic ischaemic heart disease (rs140226130, p=2.00x10-6), heart failure (rs73956431, p=2.74x10-6), atrial fibrillation (rs10163755, p=4.63x10-6), dysphagia (rs2949506, p=3.95x10-6), intestine diseases (rs970866, p=7.14x10-6) and anxiety (rs554521234, p=8.85x10-6). Consistent results were observed for TTR disease-causing mutation Val122Ile (rs76992529) with respect to carpal tunnel syndrome (p=6.41x10-6) and mononeuropathies of upper limbs (p=1.22x10-5). Sex differences were also observed in line with ATTRm and SSA epidemiology. Additionally, we explored possible modifier genes related to TTR function, observing convergent associations of RBP4 variants with the clinical phenotypes associated with TTR locus. In conclusion, we provide novel insights regarding the molecular basis of ATTRm and SSA based on large-scale cohort, expanding our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum associated with TTR gene variation.","/content/10.1101/19001537v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001537v1.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Using collaboration networks to identify authorship bias in meta-analyses","Meta-analytic methods are powerful resources to summarize the existing evidence concerning a given research question, and are widely used in many fields of biomedical science. However, meta-analyses can be vulnerable to various sources of bias, which should be considered to avoid inaccuracies. Many of these sources can be related to study authorship, as both methodological choices and researcher bias may lead to deviations in results between different research groups. In this work, we describe a method to objectively attribute study authorship within a given meta-analysis to different research groups by using graph cluster analysis of collaboration networks. We then provide empirical examples of how the research group of origin can impact effect size in distinct types of meta-analyses, demonstrating how non-independence between within-group results can bias effect size estimates if uncorrected. Finally, we show that multilevel random-effects models using research group as a level of analysis can be a simple tool for correcting biases related to study authorship.","/content/10.1101/19001305v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001305v1.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Epidemiology

"Intermittent Lactobacilli-containing Vaginal Probiotic or Metronidazole Use to Prevent Bacterial Vaginosis Recurrence: Safety and Preliminary Efficacy by Microscopy and Sequencing","Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with HIV acquisition and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recurrence after metronidazole treatment is high. HIV-negative, non-pregnant Rwandan BV patients were randomized to four groups (n=17/group) after seven-day oral metronidazole treatment: behavioral counseling only (control), or counseling plus intermittent use of oral metronidazole, Ecologic Femi+ vaginal capsule (containing multiple Lactobacillus and one Bifidobacterium species), or Gynophilus LP vaginal tablet (L. rhamnosus 35) for two months. Vaginal microbiota assessments at all visits included Gram stain Nugent scoring and 16S rRNA gene qPCR and HiSeq sequencing. All interventions were safe. BV (Nugent 7-10) incidence was 10.18 per person-year at risk in the control group, and lower in the metronidazole (1.41/person-year; p=0.004), Ecologic Femi+ (3.58/person-year; p=0.043), and Gynophilus LP groups (5.36/person-year; p=0.220). In mixed effects models adjusted for hormonal contraception/pregnancy, sexual risk-taking, and age, metronidazole and Ecologic Femi+ users, each compared to controls, had higher Lactobacillus and lower BV-anaerobes concentrations and/or relative abundances, and were less likely to have a dysbiotic vaginal microbiota type by sequencing. Inter-individual variability was high and effects disappeared soon after intervention cessation. Lactobacilli-based vaginal probiotics warrant further evaluation because, in contrast to antibiotics, they are not expected to negatively affect microbiota or cause antimicrobial resistance.","/content/10.1101/19001156v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001156v1.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Sexual and Reproductive Health

"The effect of the genetic liability to autism spectrum disorder on emotion recognition in young unaffected probands from a population-based cohort","We investigated how ASD genetic risk relates to neurodevelopmental features (491 traits tested) via polygenic risk scoring (PRS) in 4,309 young non-ASD probands from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. ASD PRS most strongly associated with the ability to correctly identify angry facial emotions in youths aged 11-17 years (R2=1.06%, p=1.38x10-7) and replicated similarly in older probands (>18 years) (R2=0.55%, p=0.036). The association in 11-to-17-year-old probands was independent of other psychiatric disorders, brain imaging phenotypes, and educational attainment. ASD PRS also associated with proband-reported emotionality and connectedness with others. The proband-reported irritability trait was highly correlated with angry facial emotion recognition (r2=0.159, p=2.74x10-5) but was independently associated with ASD PRS (R2=1.20%, p=1.18x10-4). Several informant-reported (i.e., typically mother-reported) traits were predicted by the proband ASD PRS, including duration of fear (R2=0.156%, p=0.001). These data indicate how genetic liability to ASD may influence neurodevelopment in the general population, especially the development of emotional intelligence.","/content/10.1101/19001230v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001230v1.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Misclassification of a whole genome sequence reference defined by the Human Microbiome Project: a detrimental carryover effect to microbiome studies","Taxonomic classification is an essential step in the analysis of microbiome data that depends on a reference database of whole genome sequences. Taxonomic classifiers are built on established reference species, such as the Human Microbiome Project database, that is growing rapidly. While constructing a population wide pangenome of the bacterium Hungatella, we discovered that the Human Microbiome Project reference species Hungatella hathewayi (WAL 18680) was significantly different to other members of this genus. Specifically, the reference lacked the core genome as compared to the other members. Further analysis, using average nucleotide identity (ANI) and 16s rRNA comparisons, indicated that WAL18680 was misclassified as Hungatella. The error in classification is being amplified in the taxonomic classifiers and will have a compounding effect as microbiome analyses are done, resulting in inaccurate assignment of community members and will lead to fallacious conclusions and possibly treatment. As automated genome homology assessment expands for microbiome analysis, outbreak detection, and public health reliance on whole genomes increases this issue will likely occur at an increasing rate. These observations highlight the need for developing reference free methods for epidemiological investigation using whole genome sequences and the criticality of accurate reference databases.","/content/10.1101/19000489v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000489v1.full.pdf","2019-07-06","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"A Needs Analysis of Parents Following Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young","The sudden cardiac death (SCD) of a young person is a devastating event for any parent. Inherited heart disease is often either identified or assumed to be the cause. Few studies have explored the psychosocial impact to the surviving at-risk family members. We sought to investigate the needs of parents who have experienced the SCD of their child (=45 years). A quantitative needs analysis questionnaire was developed based on semi-structured interviews, including one focus group, and a review of relevant literature. There were 38 parents who completed a cross-sectional quantitative survey. Parents perceived needs for information and support spanned medical, psychosocial, spiritual and financial domains. Medical information and support needs were identified as the most important domains, followed by psychosocial, spiritual and financial information and support needs. Importantly, psychosocial information and support needs were reported as the most unmet need, endorsed by 54% of parents. Medical information and support needs were reported as unmet by almost one third of parents. The two most endorsed needs were <U+2033>To have the option of whether or not you would pursue genetic testing for yourself or family members<U+2033> and <U+2033>To understand what happened<U+2033>. This work demonstrates for the first time, the multifactorial needs of parents after SCD in the young. With the greatest unmet need reported as psychosocial needs, there is clear necessity to find ways of integrating psychological support in to the care of families after SCD in the young.","/content/10.1101/19000877v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000877v1.full.pdf","2019-07-03","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Acceleration of chemical shift encoding-based water fat MRI for liver proton density fat fraction and T2* mapping using compressed sensing","Objectives: 
To evaluate proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and T2* measurements of the liver with combined parallel imaging (sensitivity encoding, SENSE) and compressed sensing (CS) accelerated chemical shift encoding-based water-fat separation. 
Methods: 
Six-echo Dixon imaging was performed in the liver of 89 subjects. The first acquisition variant used acceleration based on SENSE with a total acceleration factor equal to 2.64 (acquisition labeled as SENSE). The second acquisition variant used acceleration based on a combination of CS with SENSE with a total acceleration factor equal to 4 (acquisition labeled as CS+SENSE). Acquisition times were compared between acquisitions and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and T2*-values were measured and compared separately for each liver segment. 
Results: 
Total scan duration was 14.5 sec for the SENSE accelerated image acquisition and 9.3 sec for the CS+SENSE accelerated image acquisition. PDFF and T2* values did not differ significantly between the two acquisitions (paired Mann-Whitney and paired t-test P>0.05 in all cases). CS+SENSE accelerated acquisition showed reduced motion artifacts (1.1%) compared to SENSE acquisition (12.3%).   
Conclusion: 
CS+SENSE accelerates liver PDFF and T2*mapping while retaining the same quantitative values as an acquisition using only SENSE and reduces motion artifacts.","/content/10.1101/19000927v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000927v1.full.pdf","2019-07-03","Radiology and Imaging

"Liver function tests and fibrosis scores in a rural population in Africa: estimation of the burden of disease and associated risk factors","Introduction: Liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. However, its prevalence, distribution and aetiology have not been well characterised. We examined liver function tests (LFTs) and calculated liver fibrosis scores in a rural population in Uganda. 
Methodology: A cross-sectional survey of LFTs was undertaken in 2011 in a rural population cohort in South-Western Uganda. We classified abnormal LFTs based on reference ranges set in America and in Africa. We derived fibrosis scores (AST to Platelet Ratio Index, fibrosis-4, GGT to platelet ratio, red cell distribution width to platelet ratio, and S-index) to evaluate the potential prevalence of liver disease. We collected information about alcohol intake, and infection with HIV, HBV and HCV, to determine the contribution made by these factors to liver inflammation or fibrosis.
Results: Data were available for 8,099 participants (median age 30 years; 56% female). The prevalence of HBV, HCV and HIV infection were 3%, 0.2% and 8%, respectively. The prevalence of abnormal LFTs was higher based on the American reference range compared to the African reference range (e.g. for AST 13% vs 3%, respectively). The prevalence of AST/ALT ratio >2 was 11%, suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis. The highest prevalence of fibrosis was suggested by the GPR score, with 24% of the population falling above the threshold for fibrosis. By multivariate analysis, elevated LFTs and fibrosis scores were most consistently associated with older age, male sex, being under-weight, infection with HIV or HBV, and alcohol consumption. Based on population attributable risk, the highest proportion of elevated fibrosis scores was associated with alcohol use (e.g. 64% of elevated S-index scores). 
Conclusion: Further work is required to determine normal reference ranges for LFTs in this setting, to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of fibrosis scores, and to determine aetiology of liver disease.","/content/10.1101/19000968v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000968v1.full.pdf","2019-07-03","Gastroenterology

"Machine learning to predict early recurrence after oesophageal cancer surgery","Objective: To develop a predictive model for early recurrence after surgery for oesophageal adenocarcinoma using a large multi-national cohort. Summary Background Data: Early cancer recurrence after oesophagectomy is a common problem with an incidence of 20-30% despite the widespread use of neoadjuvant treatment. Quantification of this risk is difficult and existing models perform poorly. Machine learning techniques potentially allow more accurate prognostication and have been applied in this study. Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent oesophagectomy for adenocarcinoma and had neoadjuvant treatment in 6 UK and 1 Dutch oesophago-gastric units were analysed. Using clinical characteristics and post-operative histopathology, models were generated using elastic net regression (ELR) and the machine learning methods random forest (RF) and XG boost (XGB). Finally, a combined (Ensemble) model of these was generated. The relative importance of factors to outcome was calculated as a percentage contribution to the model. Result: In total 812 patients were included. The recurrence rate at less than 1 year was 29.1%. All of the models demonstrated good discrimination. Internally validated AUCs were similar, with the Ensemble model performing best (ELR=0.785, RF=0.789, XGB=0.794, Ensemble=0.806). Performance was similar when using internal-external validation (validation across sites, Ensemble AUC=0.804). In the final model the most important variables were number of positive lymph nodes (25.7%) and vascular invasion (16.9%). Conclusions: The derived model using machine learning approaches and an international dataset provided excellent performance in quantifying the risk of early recurrence after surgery and will be useful in prognostication for clinicians and patients.","/content/10.1101/19001073v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001073v1.full.pdf","2019-07-03","Surgery

"Aerobic capacity predicts skeletal but not cardiac muscle damage after a full distance Ironman triathlon - the Iron(wo)man-study","Purpose: This study examines the association between aerobic capacity and biomarkers of skeletal- and cardiac muscle damage among amateur triathletes after a full distance Ironman
Methods: Men and women (N=55) were recruited from local sport clubs. One month before an Ironman triathlon, they conducted a 20m shuttle run test to determine aerobic capacity. Blood samples were taken immediately after finishing the triathlon, and analyzed for biomarkers of cardiac- and skeletal muscle damage. Regression models examining the association between aerobic capacity expressed in both relative terms (mLO2*kg-1*min-1) and absolute terms (LO2*min-1) controlled for weight and were fitted.
Result: A total of 39 subjects (26% females) had complete data and were included in the analysis. No association between aerobic capacity and cardiac muscle damage but a significant negative association between aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle damage was observed. This association was independent of how aerobic capacity was expressed, although the model with aerobic capacity expressed in absolute terms and controlled for weight resulted in slightly higher r2 values, than when aerobic capacity was expressed in relative terms.

"A CALCIUM-RICH MULTI-MINERAL INTERVENTION TO MODULATE COLONIC MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES AND METABOLOMIC PROFILES IN HUMANS: Results from a 90-day trial","Aquamin, a calcium-, magnesium-, and multiple trace element-rich natural product has polyp prevention efficacy based on preclinical studies. The overall goal of this study was to determine the safety and tolerability of Aquamin when used as a dietary chemopreventative in humans. Additionally, we determined the effects of Aquamin on the colonic microbial community and attendant metabolomic profile.  Thirty healthy male and female human participants were enrolled in a 90-day trial in which the effects of Aquamin (delivering 800 mg of calcium per day) were compared to those of calcium alone or placebo.  Before and after the interventional period, colonic biopsies and stool specimens were obtained.  All 30 participants completed the study without serious adverse events.  There were no changes in liver function markers.  Compared to pretreatment values, intervention with Aquamin led to a reduction in total bacterial DNA and a shift in the microbial community.  Treatment with calcium alone also produced a decline in total bacteria, but smaller than seen with Aquamin, while no reduction was observed with placebo.  In parallel with microbial changes, a reduction in bile acid levels and a slight increase in the level of the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) acetate in stool specimens from Aquamin-treated participants was noted.  No change in bile acids or SCFAs was observed with calcium alone or placebo.  We conclude from these studies that Aquamin is safe and tolerable in healthy human participants and may produce beneficial alterations in the colonic microbial community and the attendant metabolomic profile.","/content/10.1101/19001255v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001255v1.full.pdf","2019-07-03","Gastroenterology

"Accuracy of ECG Chest Electrode Placements by Paramedics; an observational study","Background: The use of the 12-lead ECG is common in UK paramedic practice but its value depends upon accurate placement of the ECG-electrodes. Several studies have shown widespread variation in the placement of chest electrodes by other health professionals but no studies have addressed the accuracy of paramedics. The main objective of this study was to ascertain the accuracy of the chest lead placements by registered paramedics. Methods: Registered paramedics who attended the Emergency Services Show in Birmingham in September 2018 were invited to participate in this observational study. Participants were asked to place the chest electrodes on a male model in accordance with their current practice. Correct positioning was determined against the Society for Cardiological Science & Technology's Clinical Guidelines for recording a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (2017) with a tolerance of 19mm being deemed acceptable based upon previous studies. Results: 52 eligible participants completed the study. Measurement of electrode placement in the craniocaudal and mediolateral planes showed a high level of inaccuracy with 3/52 (5.8%) participants able to accurately place all chest leads. In leads V1 - V3, the majority of incorrect placements were related to vertical displacement with most participants able to identify the correct horizontal position. In V4, the tendency was to place the lead too low and to the left of the pre-determined position whilst V5 tended to be below the expected positioning but in the correct horizontal alignment. There was a less defined pattern of error in V6 although vertical displacement was more likely than horizontal displacement. Conclusion: Our study identified a high level of variation in the placement of chest ECG electrodes which could alter the morphology of the ECG. From a patient safety perspective, we would advocate that paramedics leave the chest electrodes in situ to allow hospital staff to assess the accuracy of the placements.","/content/10.1101/19001321v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001321v1.full.pdf","2019-07-03","Emergency Medicine

"The impact of involving young children in improving the understanding of a new eye test","Background. Although considered important, the involvement of young children in research is rare and its impact has never been measured. We aim to provide a good practice example of involvement of young children in the development of a tablet-based 3D eye test or stereotest, ASTEROID. We focus on improving understanding of test instructions. Methods. After a pre-measure of understanding was taken, we explored issues with the test instructions in patient and public involvement (PPI) sessions. Feedback was collected via observations, rating scales and children's comments. An interdisciplinary panel reviewed the feedback and decided on the implementation. Subsequently, a post-measure was collected. In Study 1, 650 children (2-11.8 years old) took part in the pre-measure, 111 children (1-12 years old) in the PPI sessions, and 52 children (4-6 years old) in the post-measure which also served as a pre-measure for Study 2. PPI sessions for Study 2 attracted 122 children (1-12 years old) and adults. 53 people (2-39 years old) participated in the post-measure of Study 2. Results. Following feedback in Study 1, we added a frame cue and included a shuffle animation. This increased the percentage of correct practice trials from 76% to 97% (t(231)=14.29, p<.001). After adding a cardboard demo in Study 2, the percentage of correct trials remained stable but the number of additional instructions given decreased (t(103)=3.72, p<.001). Conclusions. Our study demonstrates impact of involvement of very young children in research through accessible activities. It can encourage researchers to involve young children and contribute to developing guidelines.","/content/10.1101/19001362v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001362v1.full.pdf","2019-07-03","Ophthalmology

"SEXUAL BEHAVIOURS AND EXPERIENCE OF SEXUAL COERCION AMONG IN-SCHOOL FEMALE ADOLESCENT IN SOUTHWESTERN NIGERIA","Most people begin their sexual relationship during adolescence and some get involved in risky life threatening behaviors such as unwanted pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted infections. This study was therefore designed to understand the patterns of female adolescents sexual behaviours and sexual coercion experience.

A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 1227 in-school adolescents in the three senatorial district of Osun State, Southwestern Nigeria. Multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the respondents, and data were collected with pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaires. The data collected were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 21).
Three hundred and thirty seven (27.5%) were sexually exposed with a mean age of sexual initiation of 14 years. Of the 337 that were sexually exposed 153(56.5%) initiated sex early between the ages of 10-15 years, while (4.7%) had uses drugs or take alcohol before sexual intercourse. Findings revealed that of  those that were sexually exposed, 122(11%) were forced to have sex, 101(9.1%) played sex willingly, while 29(2.6%) felt threatened and 3(0.3%) were convinced with money. The proportion of the respondent who reported rape and abduction was (2.6%).
Finding from this study is consistent with earlier studies conducted in many other Nigerian cities which showed that in-school adolescents to be sexually active.  There is the need to step up campaigns to address this noticed lapse in behavior among the students in order to arrest the usual consequences of such risky sexual behavior.","/content/10.1101/19000851v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000851v1.full.pdf","2019-07-03","Public and Global Health

"Robotic middle ear access for cochlear implantation: first in man","To demonstrate the feasibility of robotic middle ear access in a clinical setting, nine
adult patients with severe-to-profound hearing loss indicated for cochlear implantation
were included in this clinical trial. A keyhole access tunnel to the tympanic cavity and
targeting the round window was planned based on preoperatively acquired computed
tomography image data and robotically drilled to the level of the facial recess.
Intraoperative imaging was performed to confirm sufficient distance of the drilling
trajectory to relevant anatomy. Robotic drilling continued toward the round window. The
cochlear access was manually created by the surgeon. Electrode arrays were inserted
through the keyhole tunnel under microscopic supervision via a tympanomeatal flap.
All patients were successfully implanted with a cochlear implant. In 9 of 9 patients the
robotic drilling was planned and performed to the level of the facial recess. In 3
patients, the procedure was reverted to a conventional approach for safety reasons.
No change in facial nerve function compared to baseline measurements was observed.
Robotic keyhole access for cochlear implantation is feasible. Further improvements to
workflow complexity, duration of surgery, and usability including safety assessments
are required to enable wider adoption of the procedure.","/content/10.1101/19000711v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000711v1.full.pdf","2019-07-03","Otolaryngology

"Trends and variation in unsafe prescribing of methotrexate: a cohort study in English NHS primary care.","Objective
To describe trends and geographical variation in methotrexate prescribing that breaches national safety recommendations; deaths from methotrexate poisoning; and associated litigation.

Methods
A retrospective cohort study of English NHS primary care prescribing data, complemented by information obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. The main outcome measures were: (1) variation in ratio of breaching / adherent prescribing, geographically and over time, between General Practices and Clinical Commissioning Groups; (2) description of responses to FOI requests.

Results
Out of 7349 NHS General Practices in England, 1689 practices prescribed both 2.5mg and 10mg tablets to individual patients in 2017, breaching national guidance. In April 2018, 697 practices (at the 90th centile and above) prescribed at least 14.3% of all methotrexate as 10mg tablets, breaching national guidance. The 66 practices at the 99th percentile and above gave at least 52.4% of all prescribed methotrexate in the form of 10 mg tablets. The prescribing of 10mg tablets has fallen over 7 years, with 10mg tablets as a proportion of all methotrexate tablets falling from 9.1% to 3.4%. 21 deaths caused by methotrexate poisoning have been reported from 1993-2017. 

Conclusions
The prevalence of unsafe methotrexate prescribing has reduced but it remains common, with substantial variation between organisations. We recommend the NHS invests in better strategies around implementation of safety recommendations. 21 deaths have been attributed to methotrexate poisoning but with no further details easily available: the full coroners reports for these deaths should be reviewed to identify recurring themes.","/content/10.1101/19000919v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000919v2.full.pdf","2019-07-02","Health Systems and Quality Improvement

"An acute bleomycin inflammatory and fibrotic mouse model of morphea is dependent upon CXCL9 and CXCR3","Morphea, or localized scleroderma, is characterized by an inflammatory phase followed by cutaneous fibrosis, which may lead to disfigurement and/or disability. Previous work from our group showed that the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 are highly upregulated in lesional skin of morphea patients. Here, we used an acute inflammatory and fibrotic bleomycin mouse model of morphea to examine the role of the CXCR3 chemokine axis in pathogenesis. We first characterized which cells produce the CXCR3 ligands in the skin using the Reporter of Expression of CXCR3 ligands mouse (REX3). We found that fibroblasts contribute the bulk of CXCL9 and CXCL10, whereas endothelial cells are key dual chemokine producers. Macrophages, which have high MFI of chemokine expression, upregulated CXCL9 production over time, fibroblasts CXCL10 production, and T cells dual chemokine expression. To determine whether bleomycin treatment could directly induce expression of these chemokines, we treated cultured REX3 mouse dermis monolayers in vitro with bleomycin or IFN<U+03B3> with TNF and found that bleomycin could induce low amounts of CXCL9 directly in fibroblasts, whereas the cytokines were required for optimal CXCL9 and CXCL10 production. To determine whether these chemokines are mechanistically involved in pathogenesis, we induced fibrosis in CXCL9, CXCL10, or CXCR3 deficient mice and found that fibrosis is dependent on CXCL9 and CXCR3. Addition of recombinant CXCL9, but not CXCL10, to cultured mouse fibroblasts induces collagen 1a1 mRNA expression, indicating the chemokine itself can contribute to fibrosis. Taken together, our studies provide evidence that acute intradermal bleomycin administration in mice can model inflammatory morphea, and that CXCL9 and its receptor CXCR3 are mechanistically involved in pathogenesis.","/content/10.1101/19000844v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000844v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28","Dermatology

"Big Five Personality Traits Influence Tinnitus Improvement Over Time","Previous studies investigating the relation between personality and tinnitus distress showed that high neuroticism and low extraversion scores are related to higher tinnitus distress measured by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and the Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ). However, little is known about the role of personality on tinnitus distress over time.
We collected the THI, TQ and Big Five Factor Index 2 of 388 patients who visited the Tinnitus Center Regensburg between 2012 and 2017, and filled in a survey with the same questionnaires in 2018. We used personality traits and  facets to predict tinnitus distress cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Neuroticism and extraversion were significant predictors of THI and TQ scores in cross-sectional linear regression setups, and could explain up to 40% of the variance. However, the linear regressions could explain only little variance of both THI and TQ longitudinally. We clustered patients in three groups based in the difference THI and TQ between the two assessments: clinically improved, clinically stable and clinically worsened. The patients in the clinically improved and clinically stable groups scored statistically significantly lower in neuroticism and higher in extraversion than patients in the group clinically worsened. We observed a similar trend among patients who tried at least one clinical treatment.
Our results suggest that personality traits, namely neuroticism and extraversion,  are  relevant markers of tinnitus distress over time and could be used to statistically distinguish patient groups with clinically relevant changes of tinnitus distress. These markers could inform both treatment responses from clinical studies and future choices on more efficient individual tinnitus treatments.","/content/10.1101/19000646v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000646v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Cost-Sensitive Machine Learning Classification for Mass Tuberculosis Screening","Active screening for Tuberculosis (TB) is needed to optimize detection and treatment. However, current algorithms for verbal screening perform poorly, causing misclassification that leads to missed cases and unnecessary and costly laboratory tests for false positives. We investigated the role of machine learning to improve the predefined one-size-fits-all algorithm used for scoring the verbal screening questionnaire. We present a cost-sensitive machine learning classification for mass tuberculosis screening. We compared score-based classification defined by clinicians to machine learning classification such as SVM-RBF, logistic regression, and XGBoost. We restricted our analyses to data from adults, the population most affected by TB, and investigated the difference between untuned and unweighted classifiers to the cost-sensitive ones. Predictions were compared with the corresponding GeneXpert MTB/Rif results. After adjusting the weight of the positive class to 40 for XGBoost, we achieved 96.64% sensitivity and 35.06% specificity. As such, sensitivity of our identifier increased by 1.26% while specificity increased by 13.19% in absolute value compared to the traditional score-based method defined by our clinicians. Our approach further demonstrated that only 2000 data points were sufficient to enable the model to converge. Our results indicate that even with limited data we can actually devise a better method to identify TB suspects from verbal screening. This approach may be a stepping stone towards more effective TB case identification, especially in primary health centres, and foster better detection and control of TB.","/content/10.1101/19000190v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000190v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28","Health Informatics

We estimate that the recent wave of quotas for women in parliament in low income countries has resulted in a 9 to 12% decline in maternal mortality. Among mechanisms are that gender quotas lead to an 8 to 10% increase in skilled birth attendance, a 6 to 12% increase in prenatal care utilization, and a 4 to 11% decrease in birth rates.","/content/10.1101/19000570v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000570v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28","Health Policy

We evaluated GISTelemed accordingly to the guidelines published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and input provided by a questionnaire customized according to AdEQUATE (questionnAire for Evaluation of QUAlity in TElemedicine systems). 39 healthcare professionals from 13 municipalities participated in the evaluation. We analyzed data from questionnaires using descriptive statistics, being Lernability and Comfort the characteristics that received the best evaluation. Quantitative evaluation based upon leprosis cases detected through tele-dermatology showed a sensitivity and PPV of respectively 77.2% and 95.3%. 22.8% of the cases detected were un-notified cases. Results from our case study show a good evaluation regarding the perceived software quality. We conclude that the integration of spatial epidemiology tools to the STT/SC system, besides enabling visualization of data in maps, allowed users to analyze the evolution of morbidities and their co-occurrences.","/content/10.1101/19000554v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000554v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28",NA,"von Wangenheim","/highwire/citation/68209/bibtext",653,"211119-653","21/11/2019","68209"
"The nature of clusters of multimorbid patients in the UK: a latent class analysis.","Objectives: To identify, describe and validate clusters of patients based on their multimorbidity, to allow better design of health services and highlight groups that may require tailored interventions. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Patients with multimorbidity were stratified by four age strata and clustered using latent class analysis. Associations between multimorbidity clusters, demographics and outcomes were quantified using generalised linear models. Setting: 382 general practices in England contributed primary care health record data to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Participants: All multimorbid adults (18 years old or more, with two or more long-term conditions) whose diagnoses are defined in 2012 (N=113,211), from a random sample of CPRD-GOLD (N=391,669). Cluster identification used a random set of 80% of the multimorbid patients (N=90,571), with consistency of results checked in the remaining 20% of multimorbid patients (N=22,640). Main outcome measures: NHS service utilisation was measured by three variables: primary care consultations, hospitalisations and repeat prescriptions in one year after January 2012. All-cause mortality was recorded within two and five years. Results: Clinically distinct and meaningful clusters were identified using robust latent class analysis for 38 long-term conditions within each age strata. Associated patient profiles and outcomes were derived. 'Physical-mental health co-morbidity' and 'Respiratory disease and multimorbidity' clusters were common across all age strata. In under 65 year olds, 'Substance misuse and mental illness co-morbidity' cluster (<7% prevalence, consisted mostly of male, current smokers and patients from derived areas) was found to have the highest demographic-adjusted 5-year mortality rate (in the 45-64 age strata, adjusted odds ratio =1.08 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.10), p<0.01) despite low health service utilisation. Cardiovascular-related clusters were prevalent in over 65 year olds where patients in the cluster 'Chronic pain, cardiovascular disease and mental illness' (65-84 age strata) had the highest primary care consultations in one year (median=23, interquartile range [14-35]) and 5-year mortality (39%). In the 85+ age strata, patients in the 'Low service use multimorbidity' cluster had the lowest number of morbidities (median=3 [2-4]), service use and mortality. Consistency of results across identification and validation data was confirmed. Conclusions:  Across age strata, a clear distinction between morbidity clusters was uncovered, both in the prevalence of long-term conditions within them, and in their associations with outcomes (service use and mortality). Interventions and policies to improve the care of multimorbid patients may be more effective when targeted on the distinct clusters of multimorbidity we have highlighted.","/content/10.1101/19000422v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000422v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28","Epidemiology

"Forecasting the impact of population ageing on tuberculosis incidence","Background: Tuberculosis (TB) disease reactivates from distant latent infection or recent (re)infection. Progression risks increase with age. Across the World Health Organisation Western Pacific region, many populations are ageing and have the highest per capita TB incidence rates in older age groups. However, methods for analysing age-specific TB incidence and forecasting epidemic trends while accounting for demographic change remain limited. 

Methods: We applied the Lee-Carter models, which were originally developed for mortality modelling, to model the temporal trends in age-specific TB incidence data from 2005 to 2018 in Taiwan. Females and males were modelled separately. We combined our demographic forecasts, and age-specific TB incidence forecasts to project TB incidence until 2035. We compared TB incidence projections with demography fixed in 2018 to projections accounting for demographic change.   

Results: Our models quantified increasing incidence rates with age and declining temporal trends. By 2035, the forecast suggests that the TB incidence rate in Taiwan will decrease by 54% (95% Prediction Interval (PI): 45%-59%) compared to 2015, while most age-specific incidence rates will reduce by more than 60%. In 2035, adults aged 65 and above will make up 78% of incident TB cases. Forecast TB incidence in 2035 accounting for demographic change will be 39% (95% PI: 36%-42%) higher than without population ageing.

Conclusions: Age-specific incidence forecasts coupled with demographic forecasts can inform the impact of population ageing on TB epidemics. The TB control programme in Taiwan should develop plans specific to older age groups and their care needs.","/content/10.1101/19001115v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001115v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28","Epidemiology

"Epigenetic prediction of major depressive disorder","Objective: DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with environmental risk factors for major depressive disorder (MDD) but has not yet been tested for its ability to discriminate individuals with MDD from unaffected individuals. Methods: Using penalized regression based on genome-wide CpG methylation, we trained a DNAm risk score of MDD (DNAm-RS) in 1,223 cases and 1,824 controls and tested in a second independent sample of 363 prevalent cases and 1,417 controls. Using DNA from 1,607 unaffected individuals, we tested whether DNAm-RS could discriminate the 190 incident cases of lifetime MDD from the 1,417 individuals who remained unaffected at follow-up. Results: A weighted linear combination of 196 CpG sites were derived from the training sample to form a DNAm-RS. The DNAm-RS explained 1.75% of the variance in MDD risk in an independent case-control sample and significantly predicted future incident episodes of MDD at follow up (R2=0.52%). DNAm-RS and MDD polygenic risk scores together additively explained 3.99% of the variance in prevalent MDD. The DNAm-RS was also significantly associated with lifestyle factors associated with MDD, including smoking status (ÃŸ=0.440, p=<2x10-16) and alcohol use (ÃŸ=0.092, p=9.85x10-5). The DNAm-RS remained significantly associated with MDD after adjustment for these environmental factors (independent association: ÃŸ=0.338, p=1.17x10-7 association post-adjustment: ÃŸ=0.081, p=0.0006). Conclusions: A novel risk score of MDD based on DNAm data significantly discriminated MDD cases from controls in an independent dataset, and controls who would subsequently develop MDD from those who remained unaffected. DNAm-RS captured the effects of exposure to key lifestyle risk factors for MDD, revealing a potential role in risk stratification.","/content/10.1101/19001123v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001123v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Current characteristics and outcomes of Cytomegalovirus Reactivation in kidney transplant seropositive recipients in the era of prophylaxis treatment. Lesson from single Moroccan center experience.","Despite the use of antiviral prophylaxis, the active cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication is still occurred in the seropositive kidney recipients. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of CMV reactivation and potential risk factors associated with CMV disease. Data of sixty kidney transplant recipients who had received CMV prophylaxis were obtained between 2013 and 2017. Quantitative nucleic acid amplification testing for CMV viraemia was assessed using Abbott RealTime Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Among the seropositive recipients, cumulative incidence for reactivation was 63%. In patients with quantitative viraemia, the time of active replication  was significantly lower compared to those with detectable viraemia (141.5, SD:96.9 vs 294.1, SD: 112.6 days, P inferior to 0.001). During prophylactic treatment, 46.7% of patients with quantifiable viraemia had experienced active replication and none among patients with detectable viraemia (P= 0.017). Importantly, symptomatic reactivation was significantly observed in the younger patients with higher peak viraemia compared to those with symptoms free (28.8, SD:5.12 vs. 38.1, SD: 12.34 years, P= 0.007) and 3.8, SD: 1.59 vs. 2.4, SD: 0. 79 log10IU/ml, P = 0.003, respectively). Furthermore, the median duration of viraemia (21.2, vs. 13.4 days, P= 0.028) and period of CMV therapy (24.3 vs 12.3 days, P inferior to 0.001) were significantly longer for this group. In addition, intercurrent infections (75% vs. 23%, P = 0.028 ) and acute rejection (50 % vs 0%, P = 0.003) were significantly more frequent in symptomatic reactivation group. In addition, peak viral load was a potential risk factor for development of symptomatic reactivation with odds ratio 3.39, 95%CI=1.21-9.53, P = 0.02). In conclusion, CMV reactivation remains serious problem for seropositive recipients who were expected to be on antiviral prophylaxis.  Patients with high level of viraemia may be at an increased risk of progression to CMV disease and adverse outcomes.","/content/10.1101/19001008v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001008v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Nutritional Supplementation during Pulmonary Rehabilitation in COPD: A Systematic Review","Uptake of nutritional supplementation during pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been limited by an absence of rigorous evidence-based studies supporting use. Our objective were to report and summarise the current evidence supporting use of nutritional supplementation to improve outcomes during pulmonary rehabilitation in stable COPD patients. 
A systematic search was conducted up to May 7th, 2019 (registration number CRD42018089142). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. Six databases were included: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online or MEDLARS Online (Medline), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (Embase), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science.
This systematic search generated 580 initial matches, of which 24 studies (1035 COPD participants) met the pre-specified criteria and were included. Our analysis does not confirm an impact of nutritional supplementation during PR, but studies, supplements and PR programmes were heterogeneous in nature.
There is currently insufficient evidence on the effect of nutritional supplementation on improving outcomes during PR in patients with COPD. Therefore, controversy remains and further research is needed.","/content/10.1101/19000786v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000786v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28","Nutrition

"Comparative analysis of functional assay evidence use by ClinGen Variant Curation Expert Panels","Background
The 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) guidelines for clinical sequence variant interpretation state that well-established functional studies can be used as evidence in variant classification. These guidelines articulated key attributes of functional data, including that assays should reflect the biological environment and be analytically sound; however, details of how to evaluate these attributes were left to expert judgment. The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) designates Variant Curation Expert Panels (VCEPs) in specific disease areas to make gene-centric specifications to the ACMG/AMP guidelines, including more specific definitions of appropriate functional assays. We set out to evaluate the existing VCEP guidelines for functional assays.
Methods
We evaluated the functional criteria (PS3/BS3) of six VCEPs (CDH1, Hearing Loss, Inherited Cardiomyopathy-MYH7, PAH, PTEN, RASopathy). We then established criteria for evaluating functional studies based on disease mechanism, general class of assay, and the characteristics of specific assay instances described in primary literature. Using these criteria, we extensively curated assay instances cited by each VCEP in their pilot variant classification to analyze VCEP recommendations and their use in the interpretation of functional studies. 
Results
Unsurprisingly, our analysis highlighted the breadth of VCEP-approved assays, reflecting the diversity of disease mechanisms among VCEPs. We also noted substantial variability between VCEPs in the method used to select these assays and in the approach used to specify strength modifications, as well as differences in suggested validation parameters. Importantly, we observed discrepancies between the parameters VCEPs specified as required for approved assay instances and the fulfillment of these requirements in the individual assays cited in pilot variant interpretation. 
Conclusions
Interpretation of the intricacies of functional assays often requires expert-level knowledge of the gene and disease and current VCEP recommendations for functional assay evidence are a useful tool to improve the accessibility of functional data. However, our analysis suggests that further guidance is needed to standardize this process and ensure consistency in the application of functional evidence.","/content/10.1101/19000661v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000661v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Association of puberty timing with Type 2 diabetes: Systematic review and meta-analysis","OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically review published evidence on the association between puberty timing and Type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (T2D/IGT), with and without adjustment for adiposity, and to estimate its potential contribution to the burden of T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline and Embase databases for publications until February 2019 on the timing of any secondary sexual characteristic in boys or girls in relation to T2D/IGT. Inverse-weighted random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool reported estimates and meta-regression to explore sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty eight observational studies were identified. All assessed age at menarche (AAM) in women (combined N=1,228,306); only one study additionally included men. In models without adjustment for adult adiposity, T2D/IGT risk was higher per year earlier AAM (relative risk (RR)=0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.89-0.93, 11 estimates, n=833,529, I2=85.4%) and for early versus later menarche (RR=1.41, 95% CI=1.28-1.55, 23 estimates, n=1,185,444, I2=87.8%). Associations were weaker but still evident in models adjusted for adiposity (AAM: RR=0.97 per year, 95% CI=0.95-0.98, 12 estimates, n=852,268, I2=51.8%; early menarche: RR=1.19, 95% CI=1.11-1.28, 21 estimates, n=890,583, I2=68.1%). Associations were stronger among Caucasians than Asians, and in populations with earlier average AAM. The estimated population attributable risk of T2D in UK Caucasians due to early menarche, unadjusted and adjusted for adiposity, was 12.6% (95% CI=11.0-14.3) and 5.1% (95% CI=3.6-6.7), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of T2D in women is attributable to early menarche timing. This will increase in light of global secular trends towards earlier puberty timing.","/content/10.1101/19000521v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000521v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28","Epidemiology

"Prospective and External Evaluation of a Machine Learning Model to Predict In-Hospital Mortality","The ability to accurately predict in-hospital mortality for patients at the time of admission could improve clinical and operational decision-making and outcomes. Few machine learning models have been developed to predict in-hospital death that are both broadly applicable to all adult patients across a health system and readily implementable, and, to the best of our knowledge, none have been implemented, evaluated prospectively, or externally validated. The primary objective of this study was to prospectively and externally validate a machine learning model that predicts in-hospital mortality for all adult patients at the time of hospital admission. Model performance was quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC). Secondary objectives were to design the model using commonly available EHR data and accessible computational methods. A total of 75,247 hospital admissions (median [IQR] age 59.5 [29.0] years; male [45.9%]) were included in the study. The in-hospital mortality rates for the training validation, retrospective validations at Hospitals A, B, and C, and prospective validation cohorts, respectively, were 3.0%, 2.7%, 1.8%, 2.1%, and 1.6%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs), respectively, were 0.87 (0.83-0.89), 0.85 (0.83-0.87), 0.89 (0.86-0.92), 0.84 (0.80-0.89), and 0.86 (0.83-0.90). The area under the precision recall curves (AUPRCs), respectively, were 0.29 (0.25-0.37), 0.17 (0.13-0.22), 0.22 (0.14-0.31), 0.13 (0.08-0.21), and 0.14 (0.09-0.21). The results demonstrated accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality for adult patients at the time of admission. The data elements, methods, and patient selection make the model implementable at a system-level.","/content/10.1101/19000133v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000133v1.full.pdf","2019-06-26","Health Systems and Quality Improvement

"Electrocardiographic Changes After Completion of a Triathlon","Objectives: Given the increasing popularity of long-distance triathlon events amongst amateur athlete and the difficulty for emergency physician to address cardiovascular complaints in the context of exercise, this study aims to:  -Identify the prevalence of electrocardiographic abnormalities before and after a long distance triathlon in a cohort of participants using the Seattle criteria. -Identify the acute changes that occur on their ECGs at the finish line of a long-distance triathlon. Methods: This prospective observational study examines the prevalence of selected standard 12-lead ECG findings, the Seattle criteria, in asymptomatic athletes before and after the completion of a long-distance triathlon. Results: Of 99 ECGs obtained prior to the race, 28 were abnormal, for a pre-race prevalence of 28.3% (95% CI (20.4, 37.8)). Of the 72 ECGs post-race, 12 were abnormal, for a post-race prevalence of 16.7% (95% CI (9.8, 26.9)). We did not observe any athletes with marked repolarization abnormalities. Common findings were increased QRS voltage significant for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)  (24 (24.2%) pre-race, 10 (14.1%) post-race), early repolarization (21 (21.2%) pre-race, 19 (26.8%) post-race) and incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) (8 (8.1%) pre-race, 11 (15.5%) post-race). McNemar test showed no agreement between the ECG pre and post results (Chi-square =6.54, p = 0.01), suggesting a possible effect of the race on ECG findings. We observed a trend to normalization of athletes ECGs with acute exercise. Conclusion: Long-distance endurance exercise might acutely affect the ECGs findings in asymptomatic athletes and abnormal ECG findings were common in our cohort of athletes. Physicians providing care to long-distance athletes should interpret ECGs in this population prudently.","/content/10.1101/19000687v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000687v1.full.pdf","2019-06-25","Sports Medicine

"Pain Reduction by Inducing Sensory-Motor Adaptation in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS PRISMA): Protocol for a Double-blind Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) presents as chronic, continuous pain and sensory, autonomic, and motor abnormalities affecting one or more extremities. People with CRPS can also show changes in their perception of and attention to the affected body part and sensory information in the affected side of space. Prism Adaptation (PA) is a behavioural intervention targeted at reducing attention deficits in post-stroke hemispatial neglect. PA also appears to reduce pain and other CRPS symptoms; however, these therapeutic effects have been demonstrated only in small unblinded studies. This paper describes the protocol for an ongoing double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of PA treatment for CRPS. The secondary aims of the study are to examine the relationships between neuropsychological changes (such as spatial attention, space and body representation, and motor spatial performance) and clinical manifestations of CRPS, as well as symptom improvement. Methods: Forty-two participants with upper-limb CRPS type I will undergo two weeks of twice-daily PA treatment or sham treatment. The primary outcome measures are current pain intensity and CRPS severity score, measured immediately before and after the treatment period. Secondary outcome measures include the results of self-report questionnaires about pain, movement, symptoms interference, and body representation; clinical assessments of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions; and computer-based psychophysical tests of neuropsychological functions. Data are collected in four research visits: four weeks and one day before treatment, and one day and four weeks after the end of treatment. Additional follow-up through postal questionnaires is conducted three and six months post-treatment. Discussion: It is hypothesised that participants undergoing PA treatment, compared to those receiving sham treatment, will show greater reduction in pain and CRPS severity score, and improvements on other clinical and neuropsychological measures. Also, more pronounced neuropsychological symptoms are predicted to correlate with more severe clinical CRPS symptoms. This study will provide the first randomized double-blind evaluation of the therapeutic effects of PA that could be implemented as a rehabilitation method for CRPS, and will contribute to the understanding of how neuropsychological changes in body representation and attention pertain to the manifestation and treatment of CRPS.","/content/10.1101/19000653v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000653v1.full.pdf","2019-06-25","Pain Medicine

"Transfer of Statistical Innovations of the 1990s-2000s in Oncology to the Biomedical Literature","Introduction: Innovations in the fields of clinical studies require time to generate and disseminate new knowledge. We aimed to specifically explore lag times between the introduction and widespread use of innovative statistical methods in oncology using the competing risks and phase I model-based clinical trials settings as examples. Methods: First, we defined a set of closed articles for each setting based on two princeps papers (Gray, Annals of Statistics 1998 for the competing risks setting and O Quigley et al., Biometrics 1990 for the phase I setting). Secondly, we retrieved from the web of science all citations of the papers included in these sets. Each journal was classified as applied, semi-applied or methodological. Results: A total of 6,727 citations for the competing risks setting and 2,639 citations for the phase I setting were found. Time to reach 25 citations was 6.2 years for the paper from Gray and 4.5 years for the Fine and Gray paper, while it ranged from 3.4 years up to at least 20.1 years and not reached for 6 papers from the competing risks setting. The vast majority (91%) of the citing papers for the competing risks setting originated from applied journals. In contrast, less than half (44%) of the citing papers for the phase I setting were published in applied journals. Conclusion: Statistical innovations in the competing risks setting have been widely diffused in the medical literature unlike the model-based designs for phase I trials, which are still seldom used 30 years after publication.","/content/10.1101/19000638v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000638v1.full.pdf","2019-06-25","Oncology

"Perception of whole-body motion during balance perturbations is impaired in Parkinson's disease and is associated with balance impairment","Background: In addition to motor deficits, Parkinson's disease (PD) may cause perceptual impairments. The role of perceptual impairments in sensorimotor function is unclear, and has typically been studied in single-joint motions. Research Question: We hypothesized that perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and contributes to balance impairments. We tested 1) whether directional acuity to whole body perturbations during standing was worse in people with PD compared to neurotypical older adults (NOA), and 2) whether balance ability, as assessed by the MiniBESTest, was associated with poor directional acuity in either group. Methods: Participants were exposed to pairs of support-surface translation perturbations in a two-alternative forced choice testing paradigm developed previously in a young healthy population. The first perturbation of each pair was directly backward and the second deviated to the left or right (1 degree-44 degrees). Participants judged and reported whether the perturbations in each pair were in the ""same"" or ""different"" direction. This information was used to calculate directional acuity thresholds corresponding to ""just-noticeable differences"" in perturbation direction. Linear mixed models determined associations between directional thresholds and clinical variables including MDS UPDRS-III score, age, and MiniBESTest score. Results: 20 PD (64+/-7 y, 12 male, >=12 hours since last intake of antiparkinsonian medications) and 12 NOA (64+/-8, 6 male) were assessed. Directional thresholds were higher (worse) among PD participants (17.6+/-5.9 degrees vs. 12.8+/-3.3 degrees, P<0.01). Linear mixed models further showed that higher thresholds were associated with MDS UPDRS-III score (P<0.01), and were associated with poorer balance ability among PD participants (P<0.01), but not among NOA participants (P=0.40). Significance: Perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and may contribute to impaired balance and falls.","/content/10.1101/19000265v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000265v1.full.pdf","2019-06-25","Neurology

"Metabolomics in juvenile-onset SLE: identifying new biomarkers to predict cardiovascular risk","BACKGROUND: Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation and increased cardiovascular risk (CVR). Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in JSLE patients not attributable to disease flares. However, it is not possible to predict those patients at greatest risk using traditional CVR factors. METHODSerum metabolomic analysis was performed using a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-platform in 31 JSLE patients. Data was analysed using cluster, linear regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results were validated in a second cohort of 31 JSLE patients and using data from a cohort of adult-onset SLE patients with known pre-clinical atherosclerotic plaque. RESULTS: Unbiased hierarchical clustering of metabolomic data identified three patient groups. Group-1 had decreased atheroprotective high density lipoproteins (HDL) and increased atherogenic very low and low density lipoproteins (VLDL/LDL); Group-2 had elevated HDL but reduced VLDL/LDL; and Group-3 had low HDL/VLDL/LDL levels. Notably, apolipoprotein(Apo)B1:ApoA1 ratio, a known CVR marker in adult cohorts, was elevated in Group-1 JSLE patients compared to Groups-2/3. The metabolomic signature was validated in a second JSLE cohort and compared with lipid biomarkers previously associated with pre-clinical atherosclerotic plaque in adult SLE patients. Linear regression analysis accounting for demographics, treatment, disease activity, lupus serological markers and body mass index confirmed that a unique metabolomic profile could differentiate between JSLE patients at high and low CVR. CONCLUSIONS: Patient stratification using ApoB:ApoA1 ratio and lipoprotein signatures could facilitate tailored lipid modification therapies and/or diet/lifestyle interventions to combat increased CVR in JSLE.","/content/10.1101/19000356v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000356v1.full.pdf","2019-06-25","Rheumatology

"18F-AV1451 PET imaging and white matter changes in progressive supranuclear palsy","Introduction: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by deposition of straight filament tau aggregates in the grey matter of deep nuclei and cerebellum. White matter changes are increasingly documented as a feature of degenerative parkinsonism. We therefore examined the relationship between tau pathology (assessed via 18F-AV1451 positron emission tomography) and white matter integrity (using diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) in PSP.  
Methods: Twenty-three people with clinically probable PSP-Richardson's syndrome (age 68.8 +/- 5.8 years, 39% female) and 23 controls underwent structural 3T brain MRI including DTI. Twenty-one patients also underwent 18F-AV145 PET imaging. DTI group comparisons were performed using Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD) and Radial Diffusivity (RD). Voxel-wise white matter integrity was correlated with 18F-AV1451 binding in typical subcortical PSP regions of interest (i.e. putamen, pallidum, thalamus and midbrain). DTI and 18F-AV1451 imaging measures were correlated with clinical impairment.
Results: Widespread DTI changes in PSP subjects relative to controls (family-wise error FWE p<0.01) were observed. In PSP, higher 18F-AV1451 binding correlated with reduced white matter integrity in the bilateral internal capsule, corona radiata, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (FWE p<0.05). Association between cognitive impairment (ACER score) and white matter deficits were found in the genu of corpus callosum and cingulum (p<0.005).
Conclusion: This cross-sectional study demonstrates an association between in vivo proxy measures of tau pathology and white matter degeneration in PSP. Longitudinal studies and more specific PET probes for non-Alzheimer tauopathies are warranted to assess the complex interplay between microstructural changes and protein deposition in PSP.","/content/10.1101/19000596v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000596v1.full.pdf","2019-06-25","Neurology

"Gait differences in patients with multiple sclerosis who have low and high levels of disability.","Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) often results in gait impairment and disability. Objective: To investigate differences in spatiotemporal gait characteristics of people with MS who have low versus high levels of disability. Between trial and inter-limb consistency and the association of gait variables with level of disability were also investigated. Methods: Participants with MS who had either low-disability [n=7; 3 females; EDSS mean: 2.7Â±0.5, range 2.0-4.5; BMI=26.9Â±6.6] or high-disability [n=11; 6 females; EDSS mean: 2.7Â±0.5, range 6.0-6.5; BMI=27.8Â±1.5) performed 2 trials of self-selected walking on an instrumented walkway. Differences in group, limb, and group by limb interactions were assessed using analysis of variance, independent-measures t-tests, and Cohen's d effect sizes (ES). Between-trial consistency of gait were assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (2, k). Results: Participants in the high disability group had increased step time (ES=0.8), cycle time (ES=0.8), and ambulation time (ES=1.2) while taking shorter strides (ES=0.9) and more steps at a slower rate (ES=1.1). The high disability group demonstrated less between-trial consistency for 69% of gait variables when compared to the low disability group. Conclusion: People with MS who have high levels of disability walk differently and with less consistency than those with lower levels of disability.

"Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis patient perspectives on clinical trials and participation","Background: Clinical trial recruitment is often the rate-limiting step in the development of new treatments reaching patients across all disease states.  With more than 1500 currently available clinical trials for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients, it is important to understand patient perceptions of clinical trial participation to improve recruitment and retention.  This study aimed to examine the specific challenges and barriers that might be reducing IBD patient enrollment and potential methods to overcome these barriers. Methods: Five in-person patient focus groups were conducted from February through May 2016 using two facilitation guides. Participants self-reported a diagnosis of Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis. Results: The five focus groups included a total of 34 participants. Participants discussed several barriers, including fears, disease severity at trial onset, potential adverse effects, time constraints, and the influence of both their primary IBD provider and support network. Methods to improve participation included better communication to prospective patients, reduced length of trial and time commitment, lower placebo rates, the option of open label extension, and support of the patient primary IBD provider.  Conclusions: This is the first study to examine patient perceptions for IBD clinical trial enrollment, including barriers to participation and methods to improve participation.  Fear and misunderstanding of clinical trials, engagement with providers, limiting time demands, and limiting the impact on work and family were found to be barriers to participation. Creative solutions to these problems could lead to greater participation in trials and more rapid advancement of new therapies to clinical approval and use.","/content/10.1101/19000273v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000273v1.full.pdf","2019-06-25","Gastroenterology

"Updating Insights into Rosiglitazone and Cardiovascular Risk through Shared Data: Individual Patient-and-Summary-Level Meta-Analyses","Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of rosiglitazone therapy on cardiovascular risk and mortality using multiple data sources and varying analytical approaches. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Data sources: GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Clinical Study Data Request (CSDR) and Study Register platforms, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to January 2019. Study selection criteria: Randomized, controlled, phase II-IV clinical trials comparing rosiglitazone with any control for at least 24 weeks in adults. Data extraction and synthesis: For analyses of trials for which individual patient-level data (IPD) were available, we examined a composite of the following events as our primary outcome: acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular-related deaths, and non-cardiovascular-related deaths. As secondary analyses, these four events were examined independently. When also including trials for which IPD were not available, we examined myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths, ascertained from summary-level data. Multiple meta-analyses were conducted, accounting for trials with zero events in one or all arms with two different continuity corrections (i.e., 0.5 constant and treatment arm comparator continuity correction), to calculate odds ratios and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results: There were 33 eligible trials for which IPD were available (21156 participants) through GSK's CSDR. We also identified 103 additional trials for which IPD were not available from which we ascertained myocardial infarctions (23683 patients) and 103 trials for cardiovascular-related deaths (22772 patients). Among trials for which IPD were available, we identified a greater number of myocardial infarctions and fewer cardiovascular-related deaths reported in the IPD as compared to the summary-level data. When limited to trials for which IPD were available and accounting for trials with zero-events in only one arm using a constant continuity correction of 0.5, patients treated with rosiglitazone had a 39% increased risk of a composite event compared with controls (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.68). When examined separately, the odds ratios for myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular-related death, and non-cardiovascular-related death were 1.25 (0.99 to 1.60), 1.60 (1.20 to 2.14), 1.18 (0.64 to 2.17), and 1.13 (0.58 to 2.20), respectively. When all trials for which IPD were and were not available were combined for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths, the odds ratios were attenuated (1.13 (0.92 to 1.38) and 1.10 (0.73 to 1.65), respectively). Effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals were broadly consistent when analyses were repeated including trials with zero events across all arms using constant continuity corrections of 0.5 or treatment arm continuity corrections. Conclusions: Results of this comprehensive meta-analysis aggregating a multitude of trials and analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques suggest that rosiglitazone is consistently associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, likely driven by heart failure events, whose interpretation is complicated by varying magnitudes of myocardial infarction risk that were attenuated through aggregation of summary-level data in addition to IPD.","/content/10.1101/19000463v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000463v1.full.pdf","2019-06-25","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Histopathologist Features Predictive of Diagnostic Concordance at Expert Level Amongst a Large International Sample of Pathologists Diagnosing Barrett's Dysplasia Using Digital Pathology","Objective: Guidelines recommend expert pathology review of Barrett's oesophagus (BO) biopsies that reveal dysplasia, but there are no evidence-based standards to corroborate expert reviewer status. We investigated BO concordance rates and pathologist features predictive of diagnostic discordance amongst a large international cohort of gastrointestinal pathologists to develop a quantitative model of BO expert review. Design: Pathologists (n=55) from over 20 countries assessed 55 digitised BO biopsies from across the diagnostic spectrum, before and after viewing matched p53 immunohistochemistry. Extensive demographic and clinical experience data were obtained via online questionnaire. We calculated discordance rates and applied multivariate regression analyses to identify predictors of concordance. Results: We recorded over 6,000 individual case diagnoses. Of 2,805 H&E diagnoses, we found excellent concordance (>70%) for non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus (NDBO) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and intermediate concordance for low-grade dysplasia (LGD, 42%) and indefinite for dysplasia (IND, 23%). Major diagnostic errors (i.e. NDBO overinterpreted as LGD/HGD or vice versa) were found in 248 diagnoses (8.8%), which reduced to 8.3% after viewing p53 labelled slides. At least 5 years of professional experience was protective against major diagnostic error for H&E slide review (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.31-0.74). Working in a district general hospital was associated with increased odds of major diagnostic error (OR 1.76, 95%CI 1.15-2.69), however this was neutralised when pathologists viewed p53 labelled slides, suggesting a beneficial impact of p53 immunohistochemistry for this group. Conclusion: We have developed an evidence-based quantitative model of BO histopathology diagnosis at expert consensus level that will inform guideline development.","/content/10.1101/19000174v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000174v1.full.pdf","2019-06-25","Oncology

"Predicting epileptic seizures using nonnegative matrix factorization","This paper presents a procedure for the patient-specific prediction of epileptic seizures. To this end, a combination of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and smooth basis functions with robust regression is applied to power spectra of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) signals. The resulting time and frequency components capture the dominant information from power spectra, while removing outliers and noise. This makes it possible to detect structure in preictal states, which is used for classification. Linear support vector machines (SVM) with L1 regularization are used to select and weigh the contributions from different number of not equally informative channels among patients. Due to class imbalance in data, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is applied. The resulting method yields a computationally and conceptually simple, interpretable model of EEG signals of preictal and interictal states, which shows a good performance for the task of seizure prediction.","/content/10.1101/19000430v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000430v1.full.pdf","2019-06-25","Health Informatics

"Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation for refractory scar-related ventricular tachycardia","Background
Stereotactic radiosurgery is a form of radiotherapy that is performed in a single session and focuses high-dose ionizing radiation beams from a collimated radiation source to a small, localized area of the body. Recently, stereotactic radiosurgery has been applied to arrhythmias (stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation - STAR), with promising results reported in patients with refractory, scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT), a cohort with known high morbidity and mortality.
Objective
Herein, we describe our experience with the use of CyberKnife, a frameless image-guided linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery system, in conjunction with CardioPlan, a cardiac specific radiotherapy planning software, to treat patients with scar-related VT, detailing its early and mid- to long-term results.
Methods
This is a pilot, prospective study of patients undergoing STAR for refractory VT. The anatomical target for radioablation was defined based on the clinical VT morphology, electroanatomical mapping, and study-specific pre-procedural imaging with cardiac computed tomography. The target volume delineated with the aid of CardioPlan was treated with a prescription radiation dose of 25 Gy delivered in a single fraction by CyberKnife in an outpatient setting. Ventricular arrhythmias and radiation-related adverse events were monitored at follow-up to determine STAR efficacy and safety.
Results
Five patients (100 % male, 63 Ã‚Â± 12 years old, 80 % ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction 34 Ã‚Â± 15 %) with refractory VT underwent STAR between January and June 2018. Radioablation was delivered in 82 Ã‚Â± 11 minutes without acute complications. During a mean follow-up of 12 Ã‚Â± 2 months, all patients experienced clinically significant mid- to late-term ventricular arrhythmia recurrence; two patients died of complications associated with their advanced heart failure. There were no clinical or imaging evidence of radiation necrosis or other radiation-induced complications in the organs at risk surrounding the scar targeted by radioablation.
Conclusion
Despite good initial results, STAR did not result in effective ventricular arrhythmia control in the long term in a selected, high-risk population of patients with scar-related VT. The safety profile was confirmed to be favorable, with no radiation-related complications observed during follow-up. Further studies are needed to explain these disappointing results.","/content/10.1101/19012880v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012880v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Far from MCAR: obtaining population-level estimates of HIV viral suppression","Background: Population-level estimates of disease prevalence and control are needed to assess the effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies. However, available data are often subject to differential missingness. Consider population-level HIV viral suppression: proportion of all HIV-positive persons who are suppressing viral replication. Individuals with measured HIV status, and, among HIV-positive individuals, those with measured viral suppression are likely to differ from those without such measurements.

Methods: We discuss three sets of assumptions sufficient to identify population-level suppression over time in the intervention arm of the SEARCH Study (NCT01864603), a community randomized trial in rural Kenya and Uganda (2013-2017). Using data on nearly 100,000 participants, we compare estimates from an unadjusted approach assuming data are missing-completely-at-random (MCAR); stratification on age group, sex, and community; and, targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with Super Learner to adjust for baseline and time-updated predictors of measurement. 

Results: Despite high annual coverage of testing, estimates of population-level viral suppression varied by identification assumption. Unadjusted estimates were most optimistic: 50% of HIV-positive persons suppressed at baseline, 80% at Year 1, 85% at Year 2, and 85% at Year 3. Stratification on baseline predictors yielded slightly lower estimates, and full adjustment reduced estimates further: 42% of HIV-positive persons suppressed at baseline, 71% at Year 1, 76% at Year 2, and 79% at Year 3.  

Conclusions: Estimation of population-level disease burden and treatment coverage require appropriate adjustment for missingness. Even in 
""Big Data"" settings, estimates relying on the MCAR assumption or baseline stratification should be interpreted with caution.","/content/10.1101/19012781v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012781v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Epidemiology

"Access to internet, smartphone usage, and acceptability of mobile health technology among cancer patients","Purpose:
The use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies to augment patient care, enables providers to communicate remotely with patients enhancing the quality of care and patient engagement. Few studies addressed barriers to its implementation, especially in medically underserved populations.
Methods:	
A cross-sectional study of 151 cancer patients was conducted at an academic medical center in the United States. A trained interviewer performed structured interviews regarding the barriers and facilitators of current and desired utilization of technology for healthcare services.
Results:	
Of the 151 participants, 35.8% were male and ages ranged from 21-104 years. Only 73.5% of participants currently have daily access to internet, and 68.2% currently own a smartphone capable of displaying mobile applications. Among all participants, utilization of a daily mHealth application was significantly higher in patients with a college-level degree (OR; 2.78, p<0.01) and lower in older patients (OR; 0.05, p<0.01). Differences in utilization when adjusted for current smartphone use and daily access to internet were nonsignificant. Among smartphone users, the desire to increase cancer knowledge was associated with a higher likelihood of utilizing a mHealth application (OR; 261.53, p<0.01).
Conclusion:	
The study suggests the access to mobile technology is the predominant determinant of utilization. Healthcare organizations should consider these factors when launching patient engagement platforms.","/content/10.1101/19012823v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012823v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Oncology

"Accurate influenza forecasts using type-specific incidence data for small geographical units","Influenza incidence forecasting is used to facilitate better health system planning and could potentially be used to allow at-risk individuals to modify their behavior. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) runs an annual competition to forecast influenza-like illness (ILI) at the regional and national levels in the US, based on a standard discretized incidence scale. Here, we use a suite of forecasting models to analyze type-specific incidence at the smaller spatial scale of clusters of nearby counties. We used data from point-of-care (POC) diagnostic machines over three seasons, in 10 clusters, capturing: 57 counties; 1,061,891 total specimens; and 173,909 specimens positive for Influenza A.  Total specimens were closely correlated with comparable CDC ILI data. Mechanistic models were substantially more accurate when forecasting influenza A positive POC data than total specimen POC data, especially at longer lead times. Also, models that fit individual counties separately were better able to forecast clusters than were models that directly fit to aggregated cluster data. Public health authorities may wish to consider developing forecasting pipelines for type-specific POC data in addition to ILI data. Simple mechanistic models will likely improve forecast accuracy when applied at small spatial scales to pathogen-specific data before being scaled to larger geographical units and broader syndromic data. Highly local forecasts may enable new public health messaging to encourage at-risk individuals to temporarily reduce their social mixing.","/content/10.1101/19012807v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012807v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Epidemiology

"Aberrant effective connectivity is associated with positive symptoms in first-episode schizophrenia","Schizophrenia is a tenacious psychiatric disorder thought to result from synaptic dysfunction. While symptomatology is traditionally divided into positive and negative symptoms, abnormal social cognition is now recognized a key component of schizophrenia. Nonetheless, we are still lacking a mechanistic understanding of how aberrant synaptic connectivity is expressed in schizophrenia during social perception and how it relates to positive and negative symptomatology. We used fMRI and dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to test for abnormalities in synaptic efficacy in twenty-four patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) compared to twenty-five matched controls performing the Human Connectome Project (HCP) social cognition paradigm. Patients had not received regular therapeutic antipsychotics, but were not completely drug naÃƒÂ¯ve. Our data reveal an increase in excitatory feedforward connectivity from motion-sensitive V5 to posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in patients compared to matched controls. At the same time, were less accurate than controls in judging social stimuli from non-social stimuli. Crucially, patients with a higher degree of positive symptoms had more disinhibition within pSTS, a region computationally involved in Theory of Mind. We interpret these within a predictive coding framework where increased feedforward connectivity may encode aberrant prediction errors from V5 to hierarchically higher pSTS and local disinhibition within pSTS may reflect aberrant encoding of the precision of cortical representations about social stimuli.","/content/10.1101/19012773v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012773v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Boosting Chinese healthcare service providers utilization of behavioural and pharmacotherapy interventions for cigarette smoking cessation by WeChat WeQuit program","Introduction: 
In China, standard smoking cessation practices are rarely used by healthcare service providers (HSPs). WeChat, a popular social media app, has been widely used in China. 
Methods: 
In this single-blind, randomized trial, undertaken in China with 8-week interventions and follow-up to 52 weeks, about 2,200 providers from different health care settings will be randomly selected to the intervention or control group. This trial will be conducted in China between June 2018 to October 2019. The intervention group will receive regular smoking cessation training program messages by the professional team to 8 weeks and follow to 52 weeks. A hard copy of the manual will be sent to each provider from the intervention group by mail after randomization. The Control group will only communicate by themselves and receive thanks messages for 8 weeks, and follow-up to 52 weeks. The trial will be carried out in two phases. The first phase is the pilot study (n=200, 8-week intervention and follow-up to 16 weeks) and the second is the main study (n=2000, 8-week intervention and follow-up to 52 weeks). The primary outcome measure will be the utilization rate of behavioural and pharmacotherapy interventions for smoking patients from 8 to 52 weeks. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT03556774).
Conclusions:
This program will be the first evidence-based educational program in smoking cessation designed specifically for the improvement of Chinese HSPs utilization of behavioural and pharmacotherapy interventions for cigarette smoking cessation in health care settings by the WeChat WeQuit program.
Implications:
This protocol may show that WeChat WeQuit training program will be effective in increasing the provision of effective tobacco cessation interventions by Chinese-speaking HSPs, especially therapists, to patients with cigarette smoking, which will provide valuable insights into bridging the gap between need and services for smoking cessation in China. Overall, we believe this program will be likely to have very substantial public health benefits if it would provide a widely accessible and efficacious smoking cessation information for Chinese HSPs.","/content/10.1101/19012682v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012682v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Addiction Medicine

"Olanzapine for the Prevention and Treatment of Nausea and Vomiting Induced by Chemotherapy for Lung Cancer: protocol for a multicenter, double-blind and randomized controlled trial","Background: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is frequently observed after the administration of chemotherapy and significantly influences the quality of life (QoL) of patients. Olanzapine has a high control rate of CINV in patients with cancer when combined with the NK-1 receptor antagonist dexamethasone and 5- hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) receptor antagonists. The efficacy of a regimen without an NK-1 receptor antagonist remains unknown. Therefore, we designed this randomized trial to provide evidence for the management of CINV.

Methods and ananlysis: This is a double-blind, multicenter and randomized controlled trial. Patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer will be assessed by physicians based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 156 participants will be enrolled and randomized to a placebo group or experiment group to receive treatment for CINV. The primary endpoint is the incidence of delayed CINV. The secondary endpoints are complete response (CR) of acute CINV, CR of delayed CINV, effective control rate (ECR) of CINV and QoL. During the six days after administration, these endpoints will be evaluated and recorded by physicians.","/content/10.1101/19012583v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012583v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Oncology

"Antimicrobial resistance trends from a hospital and diagnostic facility in Lahore, Pakistan: A five-year retrospective analysis (2014-2018)","Objective: Observing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends is critical to identify emerging pathogens and potential disease outbreaks. Determining these trends also allows for policy evaluations and development of interventions. We performed a retrospective analysis of microbiological testing results from a hospital and diagnostic facility in Lahore, Pakistan that represents country-wide sampling. Within this analysis, data was disaggregated by nationality, as it has been suggested that migration increases the burden of AMR. We sought to determine any trends in AMR among populations, which are often at-risk, while contributing to AMR surveillance in Pakistan, which currently does not have a national surveillance network. 
Methods: Retrospective analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility records from 2014 to 2018 from Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre (SKMCH&RC) in Lahore, Pakistan was performed. All positive microbiological cultures from patients was analyzed to assess antibiotic resistance rates of the most common bacterial isolates and incidence of ESKAPE pathogens and emerging outbreaks among adults and children.
Results: For all years, data for a total of 12,702 and 78,130 bacterial and fungal isolates from children and adults, respectively, with Pakistani nationality were analyzed. For all years, data for 597 and 2470 bacterial and fungal isolates for children and adults, respectively, with Afghan nationality were analyzed. AMR rates largely did not vary between populations, but rather followed similar trends. AMR rates also largely agreed with the World Health Organization Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System results for Pakistan. 
Conclusion: Pakistan requires increased AMR surveillance to identify emerging resistance infections and outbreaks.","/content/10.1101/19012617v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012617v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Epidemiology

"Temperature-related disasters in Europe - a cross-sectional analysis of the emergency events database from a pediatric perspective","This study investigates patterns of extreme temperature-related events in Europe and its significance for the public health, with a focus on the vulnerable pediatric population. A generalized additive model of average surface temperature development for the European countries is described and discussed with an in-depth analysis of the influence of temperature on evolutional and behavioral aspects.
Methods: 
Extreme temperature related events are recorded in the publicly available epidemiological database of Emergency Events (EM-DAT). A comparative and descriptive statistical analysis of this data was conducted with a focus on (prospective) records from 1988 onwards. Average surface temperature data was provided by the World Bank's Climate Change Knowledge Portal. The criteria for strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) were respected.
Results: 
Within EM-DAT, extreme temperature-related disasters in Europe were categorized as either heat waves, drought, forest or land fires, or cold waves and severe winter conditions, accordingly. The most frequent type of event recorded were cold waves (36.2%). However, cold waves and severe winter conditions only accounted for about 6,460 casualties (4.4%), while heat waves were responsible for a total of 137,533 casualties (95.1%). During the prospective observational period of the EM-DAT database, heat waves in 2003, 2006, 2010, and 2015, claimed a total of 119,760 casualties. These most severe heatwaves were geographically distributed over Russia (2010), as well as France, Italy, Spain, and Germany, each in 2003. Accordingly, analysis of temperature data revealed an increasing average surface temperature for all assessed European countries, correlating with in an increasing frequency of extreme temperature-related events.
Conclusion: 
This study shows that according to EM-DAT data extreme temperatures are an increasingly important public health threat to the European population as the average European surface temperatures are rising. Although cold waves are more frequently reported in EM-DAT, heat waves are the major cause for temperature-related casualties. Therefore, we conclude that evolutional and cultural resilience against cold and drought is significantly higher than it is against heat. Our results project that the frequency, duration and intensity of heat waves will further increase due to current climatic changes and become a more prevalent problem for future generations. Hence, we propose an emergency plan to inform the public and authorities about measurements to be taken in such extreme heat conditions to overcome the prevailing lack of information available to the public.","/content/10.1101/19012633v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012633v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Public and Global Health

"Incidence and Prevalence of Hidradenitis Suppurativa: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Background: Hidradenitis is a chronic relapsing follicular occlusive disease with a widely variable reported prevalence. The exact prevalence and incidence of HS is unknown. 

Objectives: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature to estimate the global incidence and prevalence of HS. 

Methods: Literature searches were performed on Medline, Embase, and Pubmed to identify studies reporting incidence and/or prevalence of HS. Pooled estimates of prevalence and incidence were calculated with a meta-analysis of proportions. 

Results: In total, 12 studies were included (Australia, Brazil, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, UK, USA) comprising a total population of 53,805,690. Eleven studies reported prevalence. The pooled proportion of individuals in the general population with HS was 0.36% (95% CI: 0.21, 0.56). Self-reported HS gave a higher prevalence estimate than clinician-diagnosed HS. HS is more prevalent in women. Average annual incidence of HS was 28.5 cases/100,000 (95% CI: 26.8, 30.1).

Conclusions:  We estimated the global prevalence of HS to be 0.36% with 3:2 female predominance and average annual incidence to be 28.5 cases/100,000","/content/10.1101/19012559v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012559v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Dermatology

"Global and Historical Distribution of Clostridioides difficile in the Human Diet (1981-2019): Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 21886 Samples Reveal Sources of Heterogeneity, High-Risk Foods, and Unexpected Higher Prevalence Towards the Tropic","Clostridioides difficile (CD) is a spore-forming bacterium that causes life-threatening intestinal infections in humans. Although formerly regarded as exclusively nosocomial, there is increasing genomic evidence that person-to-person transmission accounts for only <25% of cases, supporting the culture-based hypothesis that foods may be routine sources of CD-spore ingestion in humans.  
To synthesize the evidence on the risk of CD exposure via foods, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting the culture prevalence of CD in foods between January 1981 and November 2019. Meta-analyses, risk-ratio estimates, and meta-regression were used to estimate weighed-prevalence across studies and food types to identify laboratory and geographical sources of heterogeneity.   
In total, 21,886 food samples were tested for CD between 1981 and 2019 (232 food-sample-sets; 79 studies; 25 countries). Culture methodology, sample size and type, region, and latitude were significant sources of heterogeneity (p<0.05). Although non-strictly-anaerobic methods were reported in some studies, and we confirmed experimentally that improper anaerobiosis of media/sample-handling affects CD recovery in agar (Fisher, p<0.01), most studies (>72%) employed the same (one-of-six) culture strategy. Because the prevalence was also meta-analytically similar across six culture strategies reported, all studies were integrated using three meta-analytical methods. At the study level (n=79), the four-decade global cumulative-prevalence of CD in the human diet was 4.1% (95%CI=-3.71, 11.91). At the food-set level (n=232), the weighted prevalence ranged between 4.5% (95%CI=3-6%; all studies) and 8% (95%CI=7-8%; only CD-positive-studies). Risk-ratio ranking and meta-regression showed that milk was the least likely source of CD, while seafood, leafy green vegetables, pork, and poultry carried higher risks (p<0.05). Across regions, the risk of CD in foods for foodborne exposure reproducibly decreased with Earth latitude (p<0.001). 
In conclusion, CD in the human diet is a global nonrandom-source of foodborne exposure that occurs independently of laboratory culture methods, across regions, and at variable level depending on food type and latitude. The latitudinal trend (high CD-food-prevalence towards tropic) is inverse to the epidemiological observations of CD-infections (frequent in temperate regions). Findings suggests the plausible hypothesis that ecologically-richer microbiomes in the tropic might protect against intestinal CD colonization/infections despite CD ingestion.","/content/10.1101/19012450v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012450v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Drivers of Frailty from Adulthood into Old Age: Results from a 27-year Longitudinal Population-Based Study in Sweden","Background. Frailty is a strong predictor of adverse aging outcomes. However, the longitudinal drivers of frailty are not well understood. This study aimed at investigating the longitudinal trajectories of a frailty index (FI) from adulthood to late life and identifying the predictors of the level and rate of change in FI. 
Methods. An age-based latent growth curve analysis was performed in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (N=1,842; aged 29-102 years) using data from up to 15 measurement waves across 27 years. A 42-item FI was used to measure frailty at each wave. 
Results. A bilinear, two-slope model with a turning point at age 65 best described the age-related change in FI, showing that the rate of increase in frailty was more than twice as fast after age 65. Underweight, obesity, female sex, overweight, being separated from one's co-twin during childhood, smoking, poor social support and low physical activity were associated with a higher level of  FI at age 65, with underweight having the largest effect size. When tested as time-varying predictors, underweight and higher social support were associated with a steeper increase in FI before age 65, whereas overweight and obesity were associated with less steep increase in FI after age 65. 
Conclusions. Predictors for the level and rate of change in frailty are largely actionable and could provide targets for intervention. Underweight increased the risk of higher FI trajectory until age 65, whereas being overweight or obese were associated with slower progression of frailty towards the oldest ages.","/content/10.1101/19012476v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012476v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Epidemiology

"Expanded Choices with Greater HIV Prevention Benefits: A Mathematical Model of Long-Acting Injectable and Daily-Oral Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis","Objective: To assess the population impact of long-acting injectable pre-exposure prophylaxis (LAI-PrEP) when available concurrently with daily oral (DO) PrEP among men who have sex with men (MSM).

Design: Dynamic network model of HIV transmission among MSM. 

Methods: We calibrated our model to the current uptake of DO-PrEP (15% among indicated) and HIV prevalence (25.3%) among MSM in the southeastern US. Parameters for LAI-PrEP pharmacokinetics and efficacy were estimated from Phase IIa safety trials in human and macaque models. Primary analyses explored varied conditions of PrEP uptake and proportion choosing LAI-PrEP given initiation. Secondary analyses evaluated uncertainty in pharmacokinetic efficacy and in persistence to LAI-PrEP relative to DO-PrEP.

Results: If 50% of MSM currently accessing DO-PrEP choose LAI-PrEP when it becomes available, an additional 14.3% of infections could be averted over 10 years. If the availability of LAI-PrEP increased overall uptake of PrEP to 50%, the expected infections averted would increase to 23.9%. The benefit of LAI-PrEP was weakly sensitive to pharmacokinetics with 9.9% of infections averted even if LAI-PrEP efficacy were half of current empirical estimates. The superiority of LAI-PrEP was strongly attributable to better adherence and persistence with only 4.3% of infections averted if persistence were the same as DO-PrEP.

Conclusions: LAI-PrEP availability is projected to decrease HIV incidence. However, increased benefits depend upon improvements to adherence and persistence above current DO-PrEP levels. As LAI-PrEP becomes available, uptake and persistence should be monitored to ensure optimal implementation.","/content/10.1101/19012443v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012443v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","HIV/AIDS

"Cost-effectiveness of implementing objective diagnostic verification of asthma in the United States","Background:
Asthma diagnosis in the community is often made without objective testing. 

Objective:
The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a stepwise objective diagnostic verification algorithm among patients with community-diagnosed asthma in the United States (US).

Methods:
We developed a probabilistic time-in-state cohort model that compared a stepwise asthma verification algorithm based on spirometry and methacholine challenge test against the current standard of care over 20 years. Model input parameters were informed from the literature and with original data analyses when required. The target population was US adults (15 y/o or older) with physician-diagnosed asthma. The final outcomes were costs (in 2018 $) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted at 3% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were undertaken to examine the effect of alternative assumptions and uncertainty in model parameters on the results. 

Results:
In a simulated cohort of 10,000 adults with diagnosed asthma, the stepwise algorithm resulted in the removal of diagnosis in 3,366. This was projected to be associated with savings of $36.26 million in direct costs and a gain of 4,049.28 QALYs over 20 years. Extrapolating these results to the US population indicated an undiscounted potential savings of $56.48 billion over 20 years. Results were robust against alternative assumptions and plausible changes in values of input parameters.

Conclusion:
Implementation of a simple diagnostic testing algorithm to verify asthma diagnosis might result in substantial savings and improvement in patients quality of life.","/content/10.1101/19012435v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012435v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Respiratory Medicine

"No Association between HPV Vaccination and Infertility in U.S. Females 18-33 Years Old","Background: 
Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been recommended as primary prevention of HPV-related cancers for over 10 years in the United States, and evidence reveals decreased incidence of HPV infections following vaccination. However, concerns have been raised that HPV vaccines could decrease fertility. This study examined the relationship between HPV immunization and self-reported infertility in a nationally representative sample.

Methods: 
Data from the 2013-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed to asses likelihood of self-reported infertility among women aged 20 to 33, who were young enough to have been offered HPV vaccines and old enough to have been queried about infertility (n=1,114). Two logistic regression models, stratified by marital history, examined potential associations between HPV vaccination and infertility. Model 1 assessed the likelihood of infertility among women who had never been pregnant or whose pregnancies occurred prior to HPV vaccination. Model 2 accounted for the possibility of latent and/or non-permanent post-vaccine infertility by including all women 20-33 years old. 

Results:
8.1% reported any infertility. Women who had ever been married and had received an HPV vaccine were less likely to report infertility (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.57) in model 1. No other associations between HPV and infertility were found.

Conclusion:
There was no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. These results provide further evidence of HPV vaccine safety and should give providers confidence in recommending HPV vaccination. Further research should explore protective effects of HPV vaccines on female and male fertility.

What is already known on this subject?
Despite evidence that HPV vaccines are safe and effective, concerns persist regarding a purported link between HPV vaccination and infertility. These concerns were refuted by a recent population-based cohort study that found no association between the HPV vaccine and primary ovarian insufficiency. 

What this study adds?
This study broadens the existing evidence by exploring possible associations between HPV vaccination and any self-reported infertility. There was no evidence of infertility among women 20-33 years old who received one or more doses of HPV vaccine. This result provides further evidence of HPV vaccine safety, diminishing remaining concerns among clinicians and the public.","/content/10.1101/19012344v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012344v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Obstetrics and Gynecology

"Journals in Aging, Geriatrics, and Gerontology: A Survey","Aging, geriatrics, gerontology, and related areas are important areas of research as the population of older people increases in relationship to the total population. Researchers in these fields would benefit from guidance regarding sources for publishing and finding relevant scholarly journals and articles. Multiple database sites of journals were searched to provide a list of relevant publications. This list was expanded via perusal of published citation lists and searches in general search engines. A total of 243 journals were identified and examined. Of those journals, 198 journals are currently publishing and 45 journals have ceased publication. In terms of publication medium, 39% of the currently publishing journals are online-only, 4% are print-only and 59% of the journals publish both online and in print. Journals with aging in the title represent 36%, geriatrics 30% and gerontology 23%. Less than 10% have been identified as predatory journals. An expected increase in journals in the broad field of aging is indicated by the 49% of listed titles beginning in 2000 or later. This recent increase in available journals provides a need for the information listed in this paper.","/content/10.1101/19012278v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012278v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Geriatric Medicine

"Macro-parasite transmission in dynamic seasonal environment: Basic Reproductive Number, endemicity, and control","Seasonality of transmission environment, which includes snail populations and habitats, or human-snail contact patterns, can affect the dynamics of schistosomiasis infection, and control outcomes. Conventional modeling approaches often ignore or oversimplify it by applying 'seasonal mean' formulation. Mathematically, such 'averaging' is justified when model outputs/quantities of interest depend linearly on input variables. That is not generally the case for macroparasite transmission models, where model outputs are nonlinear functions of seasonality fashion. 
Another commonly used approach for Schistosomiasis modeling is a reduction of coupled human-snail system to a single 'human equation', via quasi-stationary snail (intermediate host) dynamics. The basic questions arising from these approaches are whether such 'seasonal averaging' and 'intermediate host reduction' are suitable for highly variable/seasonal environments, and what implications these methods have on models' predictive potential of control interventions.
Here we address these questions by using a combination of mathematical analysis and numerical simulation of two commonly used models for macroparasite transmission, MacDonald (MWB), and stratified worm burden (SWB) snail-human systems. We showed that predictions from 'seasonal averaging' models can depart significantly from those of quasi-stationary models. Typically, seasonality would lower endemicity and sustained infection, vs. stationary system with comparable transmission inputs. Furthermore, discrepancies between the two models ('seasonal' and its 'stationary mean') increase with amplitude (or variance) of seasonality. So sufficiently high variability can render infection unsustainable. Similar discrepancies were observed between coupled and reduced 'single host' models, with reduced model overpredicting sustained endemicity. Seasonal variability of transmission raises the question of optimal control timing. Using dynamic simulation, we show that optimal timing of repeated MDA is about half season past the snail peak, where snail population attains its minimal value. Compared to sub-optimal timing, such strategy can reduce human worm burden by factor 2 after 5-6 rounds of MDA. We also extended our models for dynamic snail populations, which allowed us to study the effect of repeated molluscicide, or combined strategy (MDA + molluscicide). The optimal time for molluscicide alone is the end or the start of season, and combined strategy can give additional reduction, and in some cases lead to elimination.
Overall, reduced sustainability in seasonal environment makes it more amenable to control interventions, compared to stationary environment.","/content/10.1101/19012245v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012245v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Brain functional network integrity sustains cognitive function despite atrophy in presymptomatic genetic frontotemporal dementia","INTRODUCTION: The presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative disease can last many years, with sustained cognitive function despite progressive atrophy. We investigate this phenomenon in familial Frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
METHODS: We studied 121 presymptomatic FTD mutation carriers and 134 family members without mutations, using multivariate data-driven approach to link cognitive performance with both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Atrophy and brain network connectivity were compared between groups, in relation to the time from expected symptom onset. 
RESULTS: There were group differences in brain structure and function, in the absence of differences in cognitive performance. Specifically, we identified behaviourally-relevant structural and functional network differences. Structure-function relationships were similar in both groups, but coupling between functional connectivity and cognition was stronger for carriers than for non-carriers, and increased with proximity to the expected onset of disease. 
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that maintenance of functional network connectivity enables carriers to maintain cognitive performance.","/content/10.1101/19012203v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012203v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Neurology

"Redefining the multidimensional clinical phenotypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes","The syndromes caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) have highly heterogenous and overlapping clinical features. There has been great progress in the refinement of clinical diagnostic criteria in the last decade, but we propose that a better understanding of aetiology, pathophysiology and symptomatic treatments can arise from a transdiagnostic approach to clinical phenotype and brain morphometry. In a cross-sectional epidemiological study, we examined 310 patients with a syndrome likely to be caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration, including behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), the non-fluent (nfvPPA), semantic (svPPA) variants of primary progressive aphasia, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). We also included patients with logopenic primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) and those who met criteria for PPA but not one of the three subtypes. To date, forty-nine patients have a neuropathological diagnosis. A principal component analysis identified symptom dimensions that broadly recapitulated the core features of the main clinical syndromes. However, the subject-specific scores on these dimensions showed considerable overlap across the diagnostic groups. Sixty-two percent of participants had phenotypic features that met the diagnostic criteria for more than one syndrome. Behavioural disturbance was prevalent in all groups. Forty-four percent of patients with CBS had PSP-like features and thirty percent of patients with PSP had CBS-like features. Many patients with PSP and CBS had language impairments consistent with nfvPPA while patients with bvFTD often had semantic impairments. Using multivariate source-based morphometry on a subset of patients (n=133), we identified patterns of co-varying brain atrophy that were represented across the diagnostic groups. Canonical correlation analysis of clinical and imaging components found three key brain-behaviour relationships that revealed a continuous spectrum across the cohort rather than discrete diagnostic entities. In the forty-six patients with longitudinal follow up (mean 3.6 years) syndromic overlap increased with time. Together, these results show that syndromes associated with FTLD do not form discrete mutually exclusive categories from their clinical features or structural brain changes, but instead exist in a multidimensional spectrum. Patients often manifest diagnostic features of multiple disorders and deficits in behaviour, movement and language domains are not confined to specific diagnostic groups. It is important to recognise individual differences in clinical phenotype, both for clinical management and to understand pathogenic mechanisms. We suggest that the adoption of a transdiagnostic approach to the spectrum of FTLD syndromes provides a useful framework with which to understand disease progression, heterogeneity and treatment.","/content/10.1101/19012260v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012260v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Neurology

"Differential asthma risk following respiratory infection in children from three minority populations","Rationale: 
Severe early-life respiratory illnesses, particularly those caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV), are strongly associated with the development of asthma in children. Puerto Rican children in particular have a strikingly high asthma burden, but prior studies of the potential associations between early-life respiratory illnesses and asthma in Puerto Rican and other minority populations have been limited.

Objectives: 
We sought to determine whether early-life respiratory illness was associated with asthma in Puerto Rican children relative to other minority children.

Methods: 
Using a logistic regression analysis, we examined the association between early-life respiratory illnesses (report of upper respiratory infection (URI), pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis/RSV) within the first two years of life and physician-diagnosed asthma after the age of two in a large cohort of minority children.

Measurements and Main Results: 
Early-life respiratory illnesses were associated with greater asthma risk in Puerto Ricans relative to other racial/ethnic minority populations. Specifically, in Puerto Ricans, the odds was 6.15 (95% CI: 4.21-9.05) if the child reported at least one of the following respiratory illness: URI, pneumonia, bronchitis or bronchiolitis. The odds were also higher in Puerto Ricans when considering these conditions separately.

Conclusions: 
We observe population-specific associations between early-life respiratory illnesses and asthma, which was especially significant in Puerto Ricans. Taken together with the known high burden of RSV in Puerto Rico, our results may help explain the high burden of asthma in Puerto Ricans.","/content/10.1101/19011528v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011528v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Allergy and Immunology

"An international multicenter examination of MOG antibody assays","Objectives: To compare the reproducibility of 11 antibody assays for IgG and IgM myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (MOG-IgG, MOG-IgM) from five international centers.

Methods: The following samples were analyzed: MOG-IgG clearly positive sera (n=39), MOG-IgG low positive sera (n=39), borderline negative sera (n=13), clearly negative sera (n=40), and healthy blood donors (n=30). As technical controls, 18 replicates (9 MOG-IgG positive and 9 negative) were included. All samples and controls were re-coded, aliquoted, and distributed to the five testing centers which performed the following antibody assays: five live and one fixed immunofluorescence cell-based assays (CBA-IF, five MOG-IgG, one MOG-IgM), three live flow cytometry cell-based assays (FACS-CBA, all MOG-IgG), and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA, both MOG-IgG).

Results: We found excellent agreement (96%) between the live CBAs for MOG-IgG for samples previously identified as clearly positive or negative from four different national testing centers. The agreement was lower with fixed CBA-IF (90%) and the ELISA showed no concordance with CBAs for detection of human MOG-IgG. All CBAs showed excellent inter-assay reproducibility. The agreement of MOG-IgG CBAs for borderline negative (77%) and particularly low positive (33%) samples was less good. Finally, most samples from healthy blood donors (97%) were negative for MOG-IgG in all CBAs.

Conclusion: Live MOG-IgG CBAs showed excellent agreement for high positive and very good agreement for negative samples at four international testing centers. Low positive samples were more frequently discordant than in similar assays for other autoantigens. Further research is needed to improve international standardization for clinical care.","/content/10.1101/19011049v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011049v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Neurology

"Influence of electromagnetic radiation emitted by daily-use electronic devices on the EyemateÃ‚Â® system","Purpose: Eyemate is a system for the continual monitoring of intraocular pressure (IOP), comprised of an intraocular sensor, and a hand-held reader device. The eyemate-IO sensor is surgically implanted in the eye during cataract surgery. Once implanted, the sensor communicates telemetrically with the hand-held device to activate and record IOP measurements. The aim of this study was to assess the possible influence of electromagnetic radiation emitted by daily-use electronic devices on the eyemate IOP measurements.
Methods: The eyemate-IO sensor was placed in a plastic bag, immersed in a sterile sodium chloride solution at 0.9% and placed in a water bath at 37 C. The antenna, connected to a laptop for recording the data, was positioned at a fixed distance of 1 cm from the sensor. Approximately two hours of quasi-continuous measurements was recorded for the baseline and for cordless phone, smart-phone and laptop. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare any possible differences between the baseline and the tested devices.
Results: For baseline measurements, the sensor maintained a steady-state. The same behavior was observed with the devices measurements during active and inactive states.
Conclusion: We found no evidence of signal drifts or fluctuations associated with the tested devices, thus showing a lack of electromagnetic interference with data transmission. Patients who already have the eyemate-IO sensor implanted, or those considering it, can be informed that the electromagnetic radiation emitted by their daily-use electronic devices does not interfere with IOP measurements made by the eyemate-IO sensor.","/content/10.1101/19011692v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011692v1.full.pdf","2019-11-20","Ophthalmology

"Creatine Kinase is Associated with Bleeding after Myocardial Infarction","Background: Highly elevated plasma activity of the ADP scavenging enzyme creatine kinase (CK) might reduce ADP and ADP-dependent platelet activation. Therefore, we studied, whether high CK after myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with bleeding.
Method: Data of the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction Study Group phase II trial on the efficacy of angioplasty following intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), are used to assess whether peak plasma CK (CKmax) is independently associated with adjudicated fatal or non-fatal bleeding (primary) and combined bleeding/all-cause mortality (secondary) in multivariable binomial logistic regression analysis, adjusting for baseline and treatment allocation covariates.
Results: The included patients (N=3339, 82% men, 88% white, mean age 57 y, SE 0.2), had a history of angina pectoris (55%), hypertension (38%), and/or diabetes mellitus (13%). CKmax ranged between 16 and 55 890 IU/L (mean 2389 IU/L; SE 41), reached within 8 h in 51% of the patients (93% within 24 h). Adjudicated fatal/non-fatal bleeding occurred in 30% of the patients (respectively 26% in the low vs 34% in the high CK tertile), and bleeding/all-cause mortality in 35% (29% in the low, vs 40% in the high CK tertile). The adjusted odds ratio for fatal/non-fatal bleeding (vs not bleeding and survival) was 2.6 [95% CI, 1.8 to 3.7]/log CKmax increase, and 3.1 [2.2 to 4.4] for bleeding/all-cause mortality).
Conclusion: Highly elevated plasma CK after MI might be a hitherto overlooked independent indicator of bleeding and hemorrhagic death. This biologically plausible association warrants prospective study of the potential role of CK in hemorrhagic diathesis, and the risk of severe, potentially fatal bleeding with antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy in the presence of high plasma CK.","/content/10.1101/19012039v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012039v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Transdiagnostic expression of interoceptive abnormalities in psychiatric conditions","Background:	 Interoception, the sensing of information about the internal physiological state of the body, is proposed to be fundamental to normal and abnormal affective feelings.  We undertook a cross-sectional characterisation of cardiac interoception in patients accessing secondary mental health services to understand how interoceptive abnormalities relate to psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses. 
Methods:	Patients attending adult mental health services (205 female, 101 male) and controls (42 female, 21 male) participated.  Clinical diagnoses spanned affective disorders, personality disorders and psychoses.  Physiological, bio-behavioural and subjective interoceptive measures included: 1) Basal heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV); 2) cardiac afferent effects on emotional processing (cardiac cycle modulation of ratings of fear vs. neutral faces); 3) perceptual accuracy, confidence, and metacognitive insight in heartbeat detection, and; 4) self-reported sensitivity to internal bodily sensations. We tested for transdiagnostic differences between patients and controls, then for correlations between interoceptive measures and affective symptoms, and for group differences across clinical diagnostic categories. 
Results:		Patients differed from controls in HRV, cardiac afferent effects on emotional processing, heartbeat discrimination accuracy, and heartbeat detection confidence. Anxiety and depression symptom severity correlated particularly with self-reported sensitivity to interoceptive experiences.   Significant differences between diagnostic categories were observed for HRV, cardiac afferent effects on emotional processing, and subjective interoception.  Patients with schizophrenia relative to other diagnoses intriguingly showed opposite cardiac afferent effects on emotion processing. 
Conclusions:	This multilevel characterisation identified interoceptive differences associated with psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses. Interoceptive mechanisms have potential value for the clinical stratification and therapeutic targeting of psychiatric disorders.","/content/10.1101/19012393v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012393v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Vascular Territory, White Matter Connections and the Neuroanatomical Basis of Memory Impairment after Stroke","Objective: To investigate neuroanatomical correlates of memory impairment 30-90 days after stroke, including the role of white matter connections in the core circuit for episodic memory.
Methods: A cohort of 179 patients with first symptomatic ischaemic stroke were enrolled into a longitudinal cognitive study, STRATEGIC. Verbal and visual memory were assessed at 5019 (range 22-109) days. Lesion topography was defined by imaging (n=152). In a representative subgroup (n=53), 3T MRI and tractography was used to define patterns of tract injury and microstructure of uninjured tracts. 
Results: Lesion location, defined by arterial territory, was associated with verbal memory impairment (F(12,164)=2.62, p=0.003), independent of other factors such as age, risk factor status and lesion volume. Independent lesion symptom mapping identified regions of the left posterior temporal white matter, within the left posterior cerebral artery territory, associated specifically with verbal recall. Visual recognition memory was associated with microstructure of the uninjured fornix but not with lesion location. 
Conclusions: Infarct location strongly influenced verbal recall performance 50 days after stroke. Damage in two locations underpinned this relationship: the thalamus; and within the left PCA territory, where disconnection of parahippocampal white matter projections contributed to verbal memory impairment in some cases. The correlates of early cognitive prognosis were domain-specific with a different pattern of associations with executive function. The association between microstructure of the uninjured fornix and visual memory might reflect the effects of comorbid pathology on hippocampal circuits.","/content/10.1101/19012385v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012385v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Neurology

"Polygenic hazard score predicts aggressive and fatal prostate cancer in multi-ethnic populations","Background: Prostate cancer causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recently, a polygenic hazard score (PHS1)--the weighted sum of 54 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes--was developed and validated to predict age of aggressive prostate cancer onset in Caucasians. We evaluated the performance of the PHS for prediction of aggressive prostate cancer and of death from prostate cancer across diverse ethnic populations.

Methods: 80,491 men of various self-reported race/ethnicities were included (30,575 controls, 49,916 cases. Previously determined genetic ancestries for these men were: 71,856 European, 6,253 African, and 2,382 Asian. Where applicable, age of prostate cancer diagnosis, age at last follow-up, TNM stage, PSA, Gleason score, and cause of death were also determined. Median age at last follow-up was 70 years (IQR 63-76). 3,983 men died from prostate cancer, 5,806 died from non-prostate cancer causes, and 70,702 were still alive at the end of follow-up. Patient samples were previously genotyped on a cancer-specific array; PHS1 was adapted for compatibility with this array (PHS2) and tested in the multi-ethnic dataset via Cox proportional hazards models for age of aggressive prostate cancer onset and for age at prostate-cancer-specific death.

Results: PHS2 had 46 SNPs: 24 directly genotyped and 22 acceptable proxies (r2>=0.94). PHS2 was predictive of age of aggressive prostate cancer onset in the independent, multi-ethnic dataset (z=48, p<10-16) and in each genetic ancestry: European (z=46, p<10-16), Asian (z=44, p<10-16), and African (z=24, p<10-16). PHS2 was also predictive of age of prostate cancer death in the multi-ethnic dataset (z=16, p<10-16). Comparing the 80th and 20th percentiles of genetic risk, men with high PHS had a hazard ratio of 5.9 for aggressive prostate cancer and 5.7 for prostate cancer death. Within each genetic ancestry group, analogous hazard ratios for aggressive prostate cancer were 5.6, 5.2, and 2.4 for men of European, Asian, and African ancestry, respectively. 

Conclusions: PHS2 is highly predictive of both age of onset of aggressive prostate cancer and age of prostate-cancer-specific death in a multi-ethnic dataset. Genetic risk stratification via PHS could guide individualized screening and treatment strategies for fatal and potentially fatal prostate cancer for men of European, Asian, and African genetic ancestry.","/content/10.1101/19012237v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012237v1.full.pdf","2019-11-19","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Labelling chest x-ray reports using an open-source NLP and ML tool for text data binary classification","The chest x-ray is a commonly requested diagnostic test on internal medicine wards which can diagnose many acute pathologies needing intervention. We developed a natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) model to identify the presence of opacities or endotracheal intubation on chest x-rays using only the radiology report. This a preliminary report of our work and findings. Using the General Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) dataset, housing inpatient clinical and administrative data from 7 major hospitals, we retrieved 1000 plain film radiology reports which were classified according to 4 labels by an internal medicine resident. NLP/ML models were developed to identify the following on the radiograph reports: the report is that of a chest x-ray, there is definite absence of an opacity, there is definite presence of an opacity, the report is a follow-up report with minimal details in its text, and there is an endotracheal tube in place. Our NLP/ML model development methodology included a random search of either TF-IDF or bag-of-words for vectorization along with random search of various ML models. Our Python programming scripts were made publicly available on GitHub to allow other parties to train models using their own text data. 100 randomly generated ML pipelines were compared using 10-fold cross validation on 75% of the data, while 25% of the data was left out for generalizability testing. With respect to the question of whether a chest x-ray definitely lacks an opacity, the model's performance metrics were accuracy of 0.84, precision of 0.94, recall of 0.81, and receiver operating characteristic area under curve of 0.86. Model performance was worse when trained against a highly imbalanced dataset despite the use of an advanced oversampling technique.","/content/10.1101/19012518v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012518v1.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Health Informatics

"Violin plot data: A concerto of crucial information on valve thrombogenicity categorized in vitro by valve motion and inferred flow velocity","Abstract:
Objectives 
This in vitro study compares mechanical (MHV) and bioprosthetic (BHV) heart valves for high amplitude short duration regional flow velocities (RFV) near valve closure.
Background 
We previously tested several clinical and prototype valves and observed RFV at levels which may be related to a dimensionless thrombogenic potential (TP).  
Methods 
A total of four valves were tested in aortic and mitral sites under pulsatile circulation in a pulse duplicator. Valves included both clinical models and experimental prototypes. An optical approach measuring projected dynamic valve area (PDVA) to gauge valve motion was implemented. Pulsatile pressures and flow rates were measured by conventional techniques and a quasi-steady flow tester was used to measure valve leakage. RFV was derived using time-dependent volumetric flow rate/PDVA. Since flow velocity and fluid shear force are related through flow velocity gradient, TPs for valves that achieve near closure during the forward flow deceleration phase were determined as RFVs relative to the control mechanical valve RFV value of -126 m/s.  
Results
TP is dimensionless and ranged between -0.45 and +1.0. Negative TPs arise when transient rebound of valve occluders is accompanied by water-hammer phenomena. Positive TPs occur during the decelerating forward flow. Bioprostheses had lowest TP transient of 0.15 with exception of a mock-transcatheter aortic valve (mTAVI) that incorporated by design a trivial perivalvular leak (~1.35 ml/s). This device demonstrated a remarkably high transient TP of 0.95. The control mechanical valves had the highest TP of 1.0. The study implicates TP transients near mechanical valve closure, and not forward or non-flow phases, as primary to shear induced activation of the coagulation cascade.
Conclusions
Our data reveals distinct TP profile differences between valve models. If verifiable, the design of future valves may utilize currently available experimental tools to determine TPs resulting in advanced devices with significantly reduced TP.","/content/10.1101/19009407v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009407v3.full.pdf","2019-11-22",NA,"SCOTTEN","/highwire/citation/70302/bibtext",1,"231119-1","23/11/2019","70302"
"Assessment of Bias in Estimates of Sexual Network Degree using Prospective Cohort Data","Background: Sexual network degree, a count of ongoing partnerships, plays a critical role in the transmission dynamics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Researchers often quantify degree using self-reported cross-sectional data on the day of survey, which may result in bias because of uncertainty about future sexual activity. 

Methods: We evaluated the bias of a cross-sectional degree measure with a prospective cohort study of men who have sex with men (MSM). At baseline, we asked men about whether recent sexual partnerships were ongoing. We confirmed the true, ongoing status of those partnerships at baseline at follow-up. With logistic regression, we estimated the partnership-level predictors of baseline measure accuracy. With Poisson regression, we estimated the longitudinally confirmed degree as a function of baseline predicted degree.

Results: Across partnership types, the baseline ongoing status measure was 70% accurate, with higher negative predictive value (91%) than positive predictive value (39%). Partnership exclusivity and racial pairing were associated with higher accuracy. Baseline degree generally overestimated confirmed degree. Bias, or number of ongoing partners different than predicted at baseline, was -0.28 overall, ranging from -1.91 to -0.41 for MSM with any ongoing partnerships at baseline. Comparing MSM of the same baseline degree, the level of bias was stronger for black compared to white MSM, and for younger compared to older MSM. 

Conclusions: Research studies may overestimate degree when it is quantified cross-sectionally. Adjustment and structured sensitivity analyses may account for bias in studies of HIV or STI prevention interventions.","/content/10.1101/19003830v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003830v2.full.pdf","2019-11-22","Epidemiology

"Interpretable AI for beat-to-beat cardiac function assessment","Accurate assessment of cardiac function is crucial for diagnosing cardiovascular disease1, screening for cardiotoxicity2,3, and deciding clinical management in patients with critical illness4. However human assessment of cardiac function focuses on a limited sampling of cardiac cycles and has significant interobserver variability despite years of training2,5,6. To overcome this challenge, we present the first beat-to-beat deep learning algorithm that surpasses human expert performance in the critical tasks of segmenting the left ventricle, estimating ejection fraction, and assessing cardiomyopathy. Trained on echocardiogram videos, our model accurately segments the left ventricle with a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.92, predicts ejection fraction with mean absolute error of 4.1%, and reliably classifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (AUC of 0.97). Prospective evaluation with repeated human measurements confirms that our model has less variance than experts. By leveraging information across multiple cardiac cycles, our model can identify subtle changes in ejection fraction, is more reproducible than human evaluation, and lays the foundation for precise diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. As a new resource to promote further innovation, we also make publicly available one of the largest medical video dataset of over 10,000 annotated echocardiograms.","/content/10.1101/19012419v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012419v1.full.pdf","2019-11-25","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Early assessment of molecular progression and response by whole-genome circulating tumor DNA in advanced solid tumors","Treatment response assessment for patients with advanced solid tumors is complex and existing methods require greater precision. Current guidelines rely on imaging, which has known limitations, including the time required to show a deterministic change in target lesions. Serial changes in whole-genome (WG) circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were used to assess response or resistance to treatment early in the treatment course. 96 patients with advanced cancer were prospectively enrolled (91 analyzed and 5 excluded), and blood was collected before and after initiation of a new, systemic treatment. Plasma cell-free DNA libraries were prepared for either WG or WG bisulfite sequencing. Longitudinal changes in the fraction of ctDNA were quantified to retrospectively identify molecular progression (MP) or major molecular response (MMR). Study endpoints were concordance with first follow-up imaging (FFUI) and stratification of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients with MP (n=13) had shorter PFS (median 62d vs. 310d) and OS (255d vs. not reached). Sensitivity for MP to identify clinical progression was 54% and specificity was 100%. MP calls were from samples taken a median of 28d into treatment and 39d before FFUI. Patients with MMR (n=27) had longer PFS and OS compared to those with neither call (n=51). Molecular response assessment can potentially enable early switching to potentially effective therapies, therefore minimizing side effects and costs associated with additional cycles of ineffective treatment. MMR may present a novel endpoint to target to improve long-term patient outcomes.","/content/10.1101/19002550v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002550v3.full.pdf","2019-11-25","Oncology

"Why so many significant Phase III results in clinical trials?","Planning and execution of clinical research and publication of results should conform to the highest ethical standards, given that human lives are at stake. However, economic incentives can generate conflicts of interest for investigators, who may be inclined to withhold unfavorable results or even tamper with the data. Analyzing p-values reported to the ClinicalTrials.gov registry with two different methodologies, we find suspicious patterns only for results from trials conducted by smaller industry sponsors, with presumably less reputation at stake. First, a density discontinuity test reveals an upward jump at the classical threshold for statistical significance for phase III results by small industry sponsors, suggesting some selective reporting. Second, we find an excess mass of significant results in phase III compared to phase II. However, once we link trials across phases, we can explain almost completely this excess mass for large industry sponsors by accounting for the incentives to selectively continue from phase II to phase III. In contrast, for trials sponsored by small pharmaceutical companies, selective continuation of trials economizing on research costs only explains less than one third of the increase in the share of significant results from phase II to phase III.","/content/10.1101/19001495v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001495v2.full.pdf","2019-11-25","Health Economics

"Is therapeutic inertia present in primary diabetes care in Malaysia? A prospective study","Aims: This prospective study aimed to determine the proportions of therapeutic inertia when treatment targets not achieved in adults T2D at three public health clinics in Malaysia.
Methods: The index prescriptions were those when the annual blood tests were reviewed. Prescriptions were verified and classified as 1) no change, 2) stepping up and 3) stepping down. Multivariable logistic regression and sensitive analyses were conducted.
Results: At follow-up, 552 participants were available for the assessment of therapeutic inertia (78.9% response rate). The mean (SD) age and diabetes duration were 60.0 (9.9) years and 5.0 (6.0) years, respectively. High therapeutic inertia were observed in oral anti-diabetic (61-72%), anti-hypertensive (34-65%) and lipid-lowering therapies (56-77%), and lesser in insulin (34-52%). Insulin therapeutic inertia was more likely among those with shorter diabetes duration (adjusted OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.87, 0.98). Those who did not achieve treatment targets were less likely to experience therapeutic inertia: HbA1c = 7.0%: adjusted OR 0.10 (0.04, 0.24); BP = 140/90 mmHg: 0.28 (0.16, 0.50); LDL-cholesterol = 2.6 mmol/L: 0.37 (0.22, 0.64). 
Conclusions: Although therapeutic intensifications were more likely in the present of non-achieved treatment targets but the proportions of therapeutic inertia were high.","/content/10.1101/19002584v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002584v2.full.pdf","2019-11-25","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Drivers of Frailty from Adulthood into Old Age: Results from a 27-year Longitudinal Population-Based Study in Sweden","Background. Frailty is a strong predictor of adverse aging outcomes. However, the longitudinal drivers of frailty are not well understood. This study aimed at investigating the longitudinal trajectories of a frailty index (FI) from adulthood to late life and identifying the predictors of the level and rate of change in FI. 
Methods. An age-based latent growth curve analysis was performed in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (N=1,842; aged 29-102 years) using data from up to 15 measurement waves across 27 years. A 42-item FI was used to measure frailty at each wave. 
Results. A bilinear, two-slope model with a turning point at age 65 best described the age-related change in FI, showing that the rate of increase in frailty was more than twice as fast after age 65. Underweight, obesity, female sex, overweight, being separated from one's co-twin during childhood, smoking, poor social support and low physical activity were associated with a higher level of  FI at age 65, with underweight having the largest effect size. When tested as time-varying predictors, underweight and higher social support were associated with a steeper increase in FI before age 65, whereas overweight and obesity were associated with less steep increase in FI after age 65. 
Conclusions. Predictors for the level and rate of change in frailty are largely actionable and could provide targets for intervention. Underweight increased the risk of higher FI trajectory until age 65, whereas being overweight or obese were associated with slower progression of frailty towards the oldest ages.","/content/10.1101/19012476v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012476v2.full.pdf","2019-11-25","Epidemiology

"Identifying the drivers of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae at a European level","Beta-lactam- and in particular carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae represent a major public health threat. Despite strong variation of resistance across geographical settings, there is limited understanding of the underlying drivers. 

To assess these drivers, we developed a transmission model of cephalosporin- and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The model is parameterized using antibiotic consumption and demographic data from eleven European countries and fitted to the resistance rates for Klebsiella pneumoniae for these settings. The impact of potential drivers of resistance is then assessed in counterfactual analyses.  

Based on reported consumption data, the model could simultaneously fit the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL and CRK) across eleven European countries over eleven years. The fit could explain the large between-country variability of resistance in terms of consumption patterns and fitted differences in hospital transmission rates. Based on this fit, a counterfactual analysis found that reducing nosocomial transmission and antibiotic consumption in the hospital had the strongest impact on ESBL and CRK prevalence. Antibiotic consumption in the community also affected ESBL prevalence but its relative impact was weaker than nosocomial consumption. Finally, we used the model to estimate a moderate fitness cost of CRK and ESBL at the population level. 

This work highlights the disproportionate role of antibiotic consumption in the hospital and of nosocomial transmission for resistance in gram-negative bacteria at a European level. This indicates that infection control and antibiotic stewardship measures should play a major role in limiting resistance even at the national or regional level.","/content/10.1101/19012997v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012997v1.full.pdf","2019-11-25","Epidemiology

"Common health conditions in childhood and adolescence, school absence, and educational attainment: Mendelian randomization study","Objectives: To assess the causal relationship of different health conditions in childhood and adolescence with educational attainment and school absence. Design: Longitudinal observational study and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Setting: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population sample of children from South-West England born in 1991-1992. Participants: 6113 unrelated children with available GCSE records and genetic data (50% female). Exposures: Six common health conditions with known genetic markers measured at age 10 (primary school) and 13 (mid-secondary school). These were: symptoms of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), depression, asthma, migraines and BMI. Genetic liability for these conditions and BMI was indexed by polygenic scores. Main outcome measures: Educational attainment at age 16 (total GCSE and equivalents points score), school absence at age 14-16. Results: In multivariate-adjusted observational models, all health conditions except asthma and migraines were associated with poorer educational attainment and greater school absence. Substantial mediation by school absence was seen for BMI (e.g. 35.6% for BMI at 13) and migraines (67% at age 10), with more modest mediation for behavioural and neurodevelopmental measures of health. In genetic models, a unit increase in genetically instrumented BMI z-score at age 10 predicted a 0.19 S.D. decrease (95% CI: -0.28 to -0.11) in attainment at 16, equivalent to around a 1/3 grade difference in each subject. It also predicted 8.6% more school absence (95% CI:1.3%, 16.5%). Similar associations were seen for BMI at age 13. Consistent with previous work, genetic liability for ADHD predicted lower educational attainment, but did not clearly increase school absence. Conclusions: Triangulation across multiple approaches supported a causal, negative influence of higher BMI on educational attainment and school absence. Further research is required to understand the mechanisms linking higher BMI with school absence and attainment.","/content/10.1101/19012906v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012906v1.full.pdf","2019-11-25","Epidemiology

"Discovery of 318 novel loci for type-2 diabetes and related micro- and macrovascular outcomes among 1.4 million participants in a multi-ethnic meta-analysis.","We investigated type 2 diabetes (T2D) genetic susceptibility in a multi-ethnic meta-analysis of 228,499 cases and 1,178,783 controls in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and other biobanks. We identified 558 autosomal and 10 X-chromosome T2D-associated variants, of which 286 autosomal and 7 X-chromosome variants were previously unreported. Ancestry-specific analyses identified 25 additional novel T2D-susceptibility variants. Transcriptome-wide association analysis detected 3,568 T2D-associations with T2D-colocalized genetically predicted gene expression of 804 genes in 52 tissues, of which 687 are novel. Fifty-four of these genes are known to interact with FDA-approved drugs and chemical compounds. T2D polygenic risk score was strongly associated with increased the risk of T2D-related retinopathy, and additionally showed evidence for association with chronic kidney disease (CKD), neuropathy, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). We investigated the genetic etiology of T2D-related vascular outcomes in the MVP and observed statistical SNP-T2D interactions at 13 variants, including 3 for coronary heart disease, 1 for PAD, 2 for stroke, 4 for retinopathy, 2 for CKD, and 1 for neuropathy. Our findings may identify potential novel therapeutic targets for T2D and genomic pathways that link T2D and its vascular outcomes.","/content/10.1101/19012690v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012690v1.full.pdf","2019-11-25","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Influenza forecasting for the French regions by using EHR, web and climatic data sources with an ensemble approach ARGONet","Effective and timely disease surveillance systems have the potential to help public health officials design interventions to mitigate the effects of disease outbreaks. Currently, healthcare-based disease monitoring systems in France offer influenza activity information that lags real-time by 1 to 3 weeks.  This temporal data gap introduces uncertainty that prevents public health officials from having a timely perspective on the population-level disease activity. Here, we present a machine-learning modeling approach that produces real-time estimates and short-term forecasts of influenza activity for the 12 continental regions of France by leveraging multiple disparate data sources that include, Google search activity, real-time and local weather information, flu-related Twitter micro-blogs, electronic health records data, and historical disease activity synchronicities across regions. Our results show that all data sources contribute to improving influenza surveillance and that machine-learning ensembles that combine all data sources lead to accurate and timely predictions.","/content/10.1101/19009795v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009795v1.full.pdf","2019-11-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Phylodynamics of pertussis in the vaccine era: transition to re-emergence","Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough in humans. Despite high routine vaccination coverage, pertussis has become the most prevalent vaccine-preventable disease in many industrialized countries, since the 1990s. While a plethora of candidate explanations for the resurgence remain hotly debated, two  prevailing ideas focus on vaccine driven pathogen adaptation and on the switch to the latest generation vaccines. We use a suite of genomic and epidemiological approaches to characterize pertussis transmission in the Netherlands, between 1949 and 2017, investigate drivers of B. pertussis population diversity, and the role of allele shifts in the resurgence. Reconciling the epidemiological data with sequence data has allowed us to characterize a resurgence that is not accompanied with increased transmission but has unique functional genomic signatures of decreased diversity. Here we show a positive association between genetic diversity and incidence which validates the hypothesis that the resurgence is associated with the expansion of more pathogenic strains. We see a direct effect of vaccination on the replicative fitness of pathogens. Our models suggest, large outbreaks are unlikely to be due to immune evasion and the vaccine switch cannot be contributing to increased pertussis incidence. Therefore, efforts aimed at mitigating the resurgence in the population at large, and particularly in vulnerable infants, are more likely to succeed by maintaining routine vaccine coverage high.","/content/10.1101/19012138v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012138v1.full.pdf","2019-11-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"PROMISE (Program Refinements to Optimize Model Impact and Scalability based on Evidence): A cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge trial assessing effectiveness of the revised versus original Ryan White Part A HIV Care Coordination Program for patients with barriers to treatment","Introduction: Growing evidence supports combining social, behavioral and biomedical strategies to strengthen the HIV care continuum. However, combination interventions can be resource-intensive and challenging to scale up. Research is needed to identify intervention components and delivery models that maximize uptake, engagement and effectiveness. In New York City (NYC), a multi-component Ryan White-funded medical case management intervention called the Care Coordination Program (CCP) was launched at 28 agencies in 2009 to address barriers to care and treatment. Effectiveness estimates based on >7,000 clients enrolled by April 2013 and their controls indicated modest CCP benefits over usual care for short- and long-term viral suppression, with substantial room for improvement.

Methods and analysis: Integrating evaluation findings and CCP service-provider and community-stakeholder input on modifications, the NYC Health Department packaged a Care Coordination Redesign (CCR) in a 2017 request for proposals. Following competitive re-solicitation, 17 of the original CCP-implementing agencies secured contracts. These agencies were randomized within matched pairs to immediate or delayed CCR implementation. Data from three nine-month periods (pre-implementation, partial implementation and full implementation) will be examined to compare CCR versus CCP effects on timely viral suppression (TVS, within four months of enrollment) among individuals with unsuppressed HIV viral load newly enrolling in the CCR/CCP. Based on estimated enrollment (n=824) and the pre-implementation outcome probability (TVS=0.45), the detectable effect size with 80% power is an odds ratio of 2.90 (relative risk: 1.56).

Ethics and dissemination: This study was approved by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Institutional Review Board (IRB, Protocol 18-009) and the City University of New York Integrated IRB (Protocol 018-0057) with a waiver of informed consent. Findings will be disseminated via publications, conferences, stakeholder meetings, and Advisory Board meetings with implementing agency representatives.

"Detection of parasite-derived transrenal DNA for the diagnosis of chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection","Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a potentially life-threatening infection endemic to Latin America that has emerged as a global public health issue due to globalization and emigration patterns. Diagnosis of T. cruzi infection is complex, especially for the chronic phase of the disease that is characterized by a low to moderate burden of the difficult to detect, tissue-dwelling, intracellular form of the parasite. Diagnosis relies on a multistep indirect serological detection approach that requires positive results in at least two independent anti-T. cruzi antibody tests. With no gold standard diagnostic method for chronic T. cruzi, new approaches are needed that can more directly test for the presence of the parasite. Here, we report on of the potential utility of a noninvasive diagnostic approach that specifically detects T. cruzi-derived cell-free repeat DNA in the urine of patients who are both serologically positive and negative.","/content/10.1101/19010934v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010934v1.full.pdf","2019-11-25","Public and Global Health

"Use of undetectable viral load to improve survey estimates of known HIV-positive status and antiretroviral treatment coverage","Objective: To compare alternative methods of adjusting self-reported knowledge of HIV-positive status and antiretroviral (ARV) therapy use based on undetectable viral load (UVL) and ARV detection in blood. 
Design: Post hoc analysis of nationally-representative household survey to compare alternative biomarker-based adjustments to population HIV indicators.
Methods: We reclassified HIV-positive participants aged 15-64 years in the 2012 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS) that were unaware of their HIV-positive status by self-report as aware and on antiretroviral treatment if either ARVs were detected or viral load was undetectable (<550 copies/mL) on dried blood spots.  We compared self-report to adjustments for ARVs measurement, UVL, or both.  
Results: Treatment coverage among all HIV-positive respondents increased from 31.8% for self-report to 42.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 37.4-47.8] based on ARV detection alone, to 42.8% (95% CI 37.9-47.8) when ARV-adjusted, 46.2% (95% CI 41.3-51.1) when UVL-adjusted and 48.8% (95% CI 43.9-53.8) when adjusted for either ARV or UVL. Awareness of positive status increased from 46.9% for self-report to 56.2% (95% CI 50.7-61.6) when ARV-adjusted, 57.5% (95% CI 51.9-63.0) when UVL-adjusted, and 59.8% (95% CI 54.2-65.1) when adjusted for either ARV or UVL. 
Conclusions: Undetectable viral load, which is routinely measured in surveys, may be a useful adjunct or alternative to ARV detection for adjusting survey estimates of knowledge of HIV status and antiretroviral treatment coverage.","/content/10.1101/19002592v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002592v2.full.pdf","2019-11-26","HIV/AIDS

"Structural neuroimaging biomarkers for obsessive-compulsive disorder in the ENIGMA-OCD consortium: medication matters","No diagnostic biomarkers are available for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have provided evidence for structural abnormalities in distinct brain regions, but effect sizes are small and have limited clinical relevance. To investigate whether individual patients can be distinguished from healthy controls, we performed multivariate analysis of structural neuroimaging data from the ENIGMA-OCD consortium. We included 46 data sets with neuroimaging and clinical data from adult (=18 years) and pediatric (<18 years) samples. T1 images from 2,304 OCD patients and 2,068 healthy controls were analyzed using standardized processing to extract regional measures of cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volume. Machine learning classification performance was tested using cross-validation, and possible effects of clinical variables were investigated by stratification. Classification performance for OCD versus controls using the complete sample with different classifiers and cross-validation strategies was poor (AUC-0.57 (standard deviation (SD)=0.02;Pcorr=0.19) to 0.62 (SD=0.03;Pcorr<.001)). When models were validated on completely new data from other sites, model performance did not exceed chance-level (AUC-0.51 (SD=0.11;Pcorr>.99) to 0.54 (SD=0.08;Pcorr>.99)). In contrast, good classification performance (>0.8 AUC) was achieved within subgroups of patients split according to their medication status. To conclude: parcellated structural MRI data do not enable good distinction between patients with OCD and controls. However, classifying subgroups of patients based on medication status enables good identification at the individual subject level. This underlines the need for  longitudinal studies on the short- and long-term effects of medication on brain structure.","/content/10.1101/19012567v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012567v1.full.pdf","2019-11-26","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Characteristics of Cardiac Memory in Patients with Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillator: the CAMI study","Background: Cardiac memory (CM) was known as a repolarization phenotype, an adaptive response of the heart on abnormal ventricular activation. The goal of this study was to determine factors associated with CM in patients receiving implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD). We hypothesized that preexisted cardiac remodeling is associated with CM.
Methods: Patients with structural heart disease (n=20; mean age 72.6  11.6 y; 80% male; mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 31.7  7.6%; history of myocardial infarction (MI) in 75%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 85%) and preserved atrioventricular (AV) conduction received primary (80%) or secondary (20%) prevention dual chamber ICD. Standard 12-lead ECG was recorded in AAI and DDD mode, immediately after ICD implant and after 7 days of right ventricular (RV) pacing in DDD mode with short AV delay. Direction (azimuth and elevation) and magnitude of spatial QRS, T, and ventricular gradient (SVG) vectors were measured immediately after implant and after 7 days of RV pacing. CM was quantified as the degree of alignment between QRSDDD-7 and TAAI-7 vectors (QRSDDD-7-TAAI-7 angle). Circular statistics and mixed models with a random slope and intercept were adjusted for days 1-7 change in cardiac activation, LVEF, known risk factors, and use of medications known to affect CM.
Results: QRSDDD-7-TAAI-7 angle strongly correlated (circular r = - 0.972; P<0.0001) with TAAI-7-TDDD-7 angle. Baseline TDDD-1 azimuth correlated with QRSAAI-7-QRSDDD-7 angle (circular r = 0.604; P<0.001). In the mixed models, history of MI (-180(95%CI -320 to -40  ); P=0.011) and female sex (-162(95%CI -268 to -55  ); P=0.003) counteracted CM-T azimuth changes (+132(95%CI 80-184  ); P<0.0001). History of VT (+27(95%CI 4-46) mV*ms; P=0.007) amplified CM-T area increase (+15(95%CI 6-24) mV*ms; P<0.0001).
Conclusions: Existing cardiac remodeling due to MI and VT significantly affect the degree of CM in response to RV pacing. Women develop less CM than men. Activation memory manifests as a smaller angle between QRS vectors of normal and abnormal activation.","/content/10.1101/19005181v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005181v2.full.pdf","2019-11-26","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Causal mediation analysis of Subclinical Hypothyroidism in children with obesity and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease","Background: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a common co-morbidity of obesity. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH), also associated with obesity, may contribute to the dysmetabolic state that predisposes to NAFLD.
Objective: To assess the relationship between SH and NAFLD in children with biopsy-proven NAFLD compared to controls. 
Design and Methods: In this retrospective study of children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and age-matched controls, the association of SH with NAFLD was assessed followed by causal mediation analyses under the counter-factual framework.  
Results: Sixty-six cases and 4067 age-matched controls were included in the study. Children with NAFLD were more likely to be male (74.6 vs 39.4%, p < 0.001), have higher modified BMI-z scores (2.3 1.6 vs 11.6, p < 0.001), and abnormal metabolic parameters (TSH, ALT, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG). Multivariate analyses controlling for age, sex and severity of obesity showed significant association between the 4th quartile of TSH and NAFLD. Causal mediation analysis demonstrates that TSH mediates 44% of the effect of modified BMI-z score on NAFLD. This comprises of 16.2% (OR = 1.1, p < 0.001) caused by the indirect effect of TSH and its interaction with modified BMI-z, and 26.5% (OR = 1.1, p = 0.01) as an autonomous effect of TSH on NAFLD regardless of the obesity.  
Conclusions: The association of SH and biopsy-proven NAFLD is demonstrated in children from predominantly Latino population. Further, a causal mediation analysis implicates an effect of TSH on NAFLD, independent of obesity.","/content/10.1101/19004242v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004242v2.full.pdf","2019-11-26","Pediatrics

"Interpretable AI for beat-to-beat cardiac function assessment","Accurate assessment of cardiac function is crucial for diagnosing cardiovascular disease, screening for cardiotoxicity and deciding clinical management in patients with critical illness. However human assessment of cardiac function focuses on a limited sampling of cardiac cycles and has significant interobserver variability despite years of training. To overcome this challenge, we present the first beat-to-beat deep learning algorithm that surpasses human expert performance in the critical tasks of segmenting the left ventricle, estimating ejection fraction, and assessing cardiomyopathy. Trained on echocardiogram videos, our model accurately segments the left ventricle with a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.92, predicts ejection fraction with mean absolute error of 4.1%, and reliably classifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (AUC of 0.97). Prospective evaluation with repeated human measurements confirms that our model has less variance than experts. By leveraging information across multiple cardiac cycles, our model can identify subtle changes in ejection fraction, is more reproducible than human evaluation, and lays the foundation for precise diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. As a new resource to promote further innovation, we also make publicly available one of the largest medical video dataset of over 10,000 annotated echocardiograms.","/content/10.1101/19012419v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012419v2.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Cardiovascular Medicine

"A Metabolomics Approach for Early Prediction of Vincristine-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy","Vincristine is a core chemotherapeutic drug administered to pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Despite its efficacy in treating leukemia, it can lead to severe peripheral neuropathy in a subgroup of the patients. Peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating and painful side-effect that can severely impact an individual's quality of life. Currently, there are no established predictors of peripheral neuropathy incidence during the early stage of chemotherapeutic treatment. As a result, patients who are not susceptible to peripheral neuropathy may receive sub-therapeutic treatment due to an empirical upper cap on the dose, while others may experience severe neuropathy at the same dose. Contrary to previous genomics based approaches, we employed a metabolomics approach to identify small sets of metabolites that can be used to predict a patient's susceptibility to peripheral neuropathy at different time points during the treatment. Using those identified metabolites, we developed a novel strategy to predict peripheral neuropathy and subsequently adjust the vincristine dose accordingly. In accordance with this novel strategy, we created a free user-friendly tool, VIPNp, for physicians to easily implement our prediction strategy. Our results showed that focusing on metabolites, which encompasses both genotypic and phenotypic variations, can enable early prediction of peripheral neuropathy in pediatric leukemia patients.","/content/10.1101/19013078v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013078v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Pharmacology and Therapeutics

"Statistical limitations on drawing inferences about proportional recovery","Background. Numerous studies have found large statistical relationships between the amount of recovery and initial impairments in people with stroke. When change scores are regressed onto initial impairments, the resulting slope is approximately 0.7 for a variety of outcomes. These findings have led to the 70% ""proportional recovery rule"" and the argument that proportional recovery represents a biological phenomenon. Previous studies of proportional recovery are confounded by statistical limitations that come from regressing change scores onto initial impairments in bounded scales.

Objective. Our goal is to show that data claimed as evidence for proportional recovery are generally consistent with random patterns of recovery, once statistical limitations are taken into account.

Methods. Using a pooled dataset of N=373 Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) upper extremity scores extracted from published literature, we ran simulations to illustrate three main arguments: (1) Mathematical coupling renders the traditional null-hypothesis significance test irrelevant in proportional recovery studies; (2) Proportional recovery is one of many alternative hypotheses; (3) Current evidence claimed in favor of proportional recovery is consistent with uniform random recovery.

Results. Our simulations show that if all data were included (no exclusion of ""non-fitters"") regressing change scores onto initial impairments in a bounded scale would lead to a slope of 0.5. Similarly, cluster analysis will spuriously identify groups of fitters and non-fitters, leading to a slope for the fitters of 0.7, when the underlying recovery is random.

Conclusions. These results cast doubt on the validity of ""proportional recovery"" as a population level-statistic and a biological phenomenon.","/content/10.1101/19013060v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013060v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Adopting a new model of care for treating patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia: early results of a vascular limb salvage clinic","Background
Vascular limb salvage services can potentially improve outcomes for patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI) and/or diabetic foot ulceration (DFU). This study aims to evaluate the early outcomes for a vascular limb salvage (VaLS) clinic and investigate times-to-treatment.
 
Methods
A retrospective analysis involving all patients diagnosed with CLTI/DFU within the VaLS clinic from February 2018-February 2019 was undertaken. Data were compared to two comparator cohorts; patients managed prior to the clinic, between May 2017-February 2018 (Pre-Clinic (PC)), and patients managed outside of clinic, between February 2018-February 2019 (Alternative Pathways (AP)). Major amputation at 12 months was the primary outcome. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and adjusted Coxs proportional hazard models were utilised to compare outcomes. 

Results
Six-hundred and forty-six patients (VaLS=200, PC=252, AP=194) were included (median age=73 years, median follow-up=365 days). Within the VaLS clinic, patients underwent assessment within a median of 2.1[IQR 1.3-3.1] days from referral. No differences in median time from assessment to treatment were identified (VaLS=6.1[3.9-11.1] vs. AP=5.7[2.6-12.9] days, p=.394; VaLS vs. PC=6.1[2.8-22.8] days, p=.888). The VaLS cohort had a significantly lower rate of major amputation at 12 months (9.5%) compared to both the AP (19.6%, aHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24-0.74, p=.003) and the PC (19.4%; aHR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.78, p=.004) cohorts, after adjustment for potential confounding. 

Conclusions
A limb salvage clinic can help reduce the rate of major amputation and provides a model which delivers timely vascular assessment. Whilst early outcomes are promising, further evaluation is required to assess longer-term outcomes and reduce time-to-treatment.","/content/10.1101/19013037v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013037v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Surgery

"Electrophysiological Studies of Reception of Facial Communication in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ) are both characterized by difficulty with social cognition. Likewise, social brain activity is atypical in both disorders and indicates atypical reception of facial communication, a key area in the Research Domain Criteria framework for identifying common biological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders. To identify areas of overlap and dissociation between ASD and SZ, this paper reviews studies of electrophysiological (EEG) response to facial stimuli across ASD and SZ populations. We focus on findings regarding amplitude and latency of four brain responses implicated in social perception: P100, N170, N250, and P300. There were many inconsistent findings in both the ASD and SZ literatures; however, replication across studies was strongest for delayed N170 latency in ASD and attenuated N170 amplitude in SZ. EEG responses corresponded with clinical symptoms in multiple samples. These results highlight the challenges associated with replicating research findings in heterogeneous clinical populations, as well as the need for transdiagnostic research and for designing studies to examine relationships among continuous quantifications of behavior and neural activity across neurodevelopmental disorders.","/content/10.1101/19013003v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013003v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"An application of machine learning to assist medication order review by pharmacists in a health care center","The objective of this study was to determine if it is feasible to use machine learning to evaluate how a medication order is contextually appropriate for a patient, in order to assist order review by pharmacists.  A neural network was constructed using as input the sequence of word2vec embeddings of the 30 previous orders, as well as the currently active medications, pharmacological classes and ordering department, to predict the next order. The model was trained with data from 2013 to 2017, optimized using 5-fold cross-validation, and tested on orders from 2018. A survey was developed to obtain pharmacist ratings on a sample of 20 orders, which were compared with predictions.  The training set included 1 022 272 orders. The test set included 95 310 orders. Baseline training set top 1, top 10 and top 30 accuracy using a dummy classifier were respectively 4.5\%, 23.6\% and 44.1\%. Final test set accuracies were, respectively, 44.4\%, 69.9\% and 80.4\%. Populations in which the model performed the best were obstetrics and gynecology patients and newborn babies (either in or out of neonatal intensive care). Pharmacists agreed poorly on their ratings of sampled orders with a Fleiss kappa of 0.283.  The breakdown of metrics by population showed better performance in patients following less variable order patterns, indicating potential usefulness in triaging routine orders to less extensive pharmacist review.  We conclude that machine learning has potential for helping pharmacists review medication orders. Future studies should aim at evaluating the clinical benefits of using such a model in practice.","/content/10.1101/19013029v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013029v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Health Informatics

"Rare Loss-of-Function Mutations of PTGIR identified in Fibromuscular Dysplasia and Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection","Background: Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) and Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) are related, non-atherosclerotic arterial diseases mainly affecting middle-aged women. Little is known about their physiopathological mechanisms. 
Objectives: We aimed to identify rare genetic causes to elucidate molecular mechanisms implicated in FMD and SCAD.
Methods: We analyzed 29 exomes that included familial and sporadic FMD. Follow-up was conducted by targeted or Sanger sequencing (1,071 FMD and 365 SCAD patients) or lookups in exome (264 FMD) or genome sequences (488 SCAD), all independent and unrelated. We used TRAPD burden test to test for enrichment in patients compared to gnomAD controls. The biological effects of variants on receptor signaling and protein expression were characterized using transient overexpression in human cells.
Results: We identified one rare loss-of-function variant (LoF) (MAFgnomAD=0.000075) shared by two FMD sisters in the prostaglandin I2 receptor (hIP) gene (PTGIR), a key player in vascular remodeling. Follow-up in >1,300 FMD patients revealed four additional LoF allele carriers and a putative enrichment in FMD (P=0.0008), in addition to several rare missense variants. We confirmed the LoFs (Q163X and P17RfsX6) and one missense (L67P) to severely impair hIP function in vitro. Genetic analyses of PTGIR in SCAD revealed one patient who carries Q163X, one with L67P and one carrying a rare splicing mutation (c.768+1C>G), but not a significant enrichment (PTRAPD=0.12) in SCAD. 
Conclusions: Our study shows that rare genetic mutations in PTGIR are enriched among FMD patients and found in SCAD patients, suggesting a role for prostacyclin signaling in non-atherosclerotic stenosis and dissection.","/content/10.1101/19012484v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012484v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"A Cognitive Development Chart for School-age Children and Adolescents","Objective: To evaluate the reliability and predictive utility of a time-efficient cognitive development chart that seeks to identify children and adolescents with high-risk for multiple outcomes such as mental health problems, substance use, and educational difficulties.
Method: We analyzed data from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort for Psychiatric Disorders (HRC), a longitudinal school-based study conducted from 2010-2011 to 2013-2014. Participants were 2,239 children and adolescents, 6 to 17 years of age, who completed the cognitive assessment at baseline. The task used to track cognitive development was the Two Choice Reaction Time task (<3 minutes of duration, computer-based), which assesses the accuracy and speed of perceptual decision-making. Mental health, substance use, and educational outcomes were assessed by validated standardized methods. Key variables were measured at baseline and 3-year follow-up. The predictive utility was assessed using static (deviations from the age-expected performance at baseline) and dynamic (deviations from the age-expected change in performance over time) indicators. 
Results: The reliability of the task parameter was high (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.8). Static indicators of cognitive development significantly predicted concurrent mental, intellectual and educational difficulties, as well as incident and persistent educational difficulties and substance use in the 3-year follow-up. Dynamic indicators predicted persistent mental health problems. 
Conclusion: Primary-care and mental health professionals need a time-efficient tool for tracking deviations from age-expected cognitive development, which predicts multiple unwanted outcomes at the same time. If replicated, future results could support the generation of tools for tracking risk for mental health, substance use, and educational difficulties.","/content/10.1101/19012963v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012963v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Primary Care Research

"Individual differences in the course of youth depression: The importance of renitence and reversion","Studies of developmental trajectories of depression are important for understanding its etiology. Existing studies have been limited by short time frames and no studies have explored a key factor: differential patterns of responding to life events. This paper introduces a novel analytic technique, growth mixture modeling with structured residuals, to examine the course of youth depression symptoms in a large, prospective cohort (N=11,641, ages 4-16.5). Age-specific critical points were identified at ages 10 and 13 where depression symptoms spiked for a minority of children. However, most depression risk was due to dynamic responses to environmental events, drawn not from a small pool of persistently depressed children, but a larger pool of children who varied across higher and lower symptom levels.","/content/10.1101/19012872v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012872v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"The impact of public health interventions on the future prevalence of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae: a population based mathematical modelling study","Background: Extended-spectrum betalactamase (ESBL-) producing K. pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of infections with antimicrobial resistant bacteria worldwide. The spread of colonization of humans with this pathogen is on the rise. The future prevalence of colonization with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, and the potential of public health interventions to lower it, remain uncertain. Methods: Based on detailed data on antimicrobial consumption and susceptibility systematically recorded for over 13 years in a Swiss region, we developed a mathematical model to i) reconstruct the observed course of colonization with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae; and ii) to assess the potential impact of public health interventions on future trends in colonization. Results: Simulated prevalence of colonization with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae stabilized in the near future when rates of antimicrobial consumption and in-hospital transmission remained stable in the main analyses (simulated prevalence in 2025 was 5.3% (5.0%-9.1%) in hospitals and 2.7% (2.1%-4.6%) in the community versus 5.6% (5.1%-9.5%) and 2.8% (2.2%-5.0%) in 2019). The largest changes in future prevalence were observed in simulations that assumed changes in overall antimicrobial consumption. When overall antimicrobial consumption was set to decrease by 50%, prevalence in 2025 declined by 89% in hospitals and by 84% in the community. A 50% decline in transmission rate within hospitals led to a reduction in prevalence of 43% in hospitals and of 13% in the community by 2025. Prevalence changed much less (<9%) across scenarios with reduced carbapenem consumption. Assuming higher rates for the contribution from external sources of colonization, led to decreasing estimations of future prevalence in hospitals. While high uncertainty remains on the magnitude of these contribution, the best model fit suggested that as much as 46% (95% CI: 12%-96 %) of observed colonizations could be attributable to sources other than human-to-human transmission within the geographical setting (i.e., non-local transmission). Conclusions: This study suggests that overall antimicrobial consumption will be, by far, the most powerful driver of future prevalence and that a large fraction of colonizations could be attributed to non-local transmission.","/content/10.1101/19012765v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012765v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Influenza-associated mortality for circulatory and respiratory causes during the 2013-2014 through the 2018-2019 influenza seasons in Russia","Background: Information on influenza-associated mortality in Russia is limited and largely related to deaths with influenza in the diagnosis that represent a small fraction of all influenza-associated deaths.

Methods: Using previously developed methodology (Goldstein et al., Epidemiology 2012), we regressed the monthly rates of mortality for respiratory causes, as well as circulatory causes (available from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat)) during the 2013/14 through the 2018/19 influenza seasons linearly against the monthly proxies for the incidence of influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B (obtained using data from the Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza (RII) on influenza/ARI consultations, testing of respiratory specimens and genetic/antigenic characterization of influenza viruses), adjusting for the baseline rates of mortality not associated with influenza circulation and temporal trends.

Results: For the 2013/14 through the 2018/19 seasons, influenza circulation was associated with an average annual 17636 (95% CI (9482,25790)) deaths for circulatory causes and 4179 (3250,5109) deaths for respiratory causes, with the largest number of deaths (32298 (18071,46525) for circulatory causes and 6689 (5019,8359) for respiratory causes) estimated during the 2014/15 influenza season. Influenza A/H3N2 was responsible for 51.8% of all circulatory influenza-associated deaths and 37.2% of all respiratory influenza-associated deaths. Influenza A/H1N1 was responsible for 23.4% of all circulatory influenza-associated deaths and 29.5% of all respiratory influenza-associated deaths. Influenza B was responsible for 24.9% of all circulatory influenza-associated deaths and 33.3% of all respiratory influenza-associated deaths, with the overwhelming majority of those deaths being caused by the B/Yamagata viruses. Compared to the 2013/14 through the 2015/16 seasons, during the 2016/17 through the 2018/19 seasons (when levels of influenza vaccination were significantly higher), the volume of influenza-associated mortality declined by about 16.1%, or 3809 annual respiratory and circulatory deaths.

Conclusions: Influenza circulation is associated with a substantial mortality burden in Russia, particularly for circulatory deaths, with some reduction in mortality rates observed following the major increase in influenza vaccination coverage. Those results support the potential utility of further extending the levels of influenza vaccination, the use of quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and extra efforts for protecting individuals with circulatory disease in Russia, including vaccination and the use of antiviral medications.","/content/10.1101/19012856v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012856v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Epidemiology

"Estimating the Per-Application Effectiveness of Chlorhexidine Gluconate and Mupirocin in Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Decolonization in Intensive Care Units","Introduction: Chlorhexidine gluconate and mupirocin are widely used to decolonize patientswith methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and reduce risks of infection in hospitalized populations. The probability that a treated patient would be decolonized, which we term per-application effectiveness, is difficult to directly measure. Quantifying the efficacy of per-application effectiveness of CHG and mupirocin is important for studies evaluating alternative decolonization strategies or schedules as well as identifying whether there is room for improved decolonizing agents.

Methods: Using a stochastic compartmental model of an intensive care unit (ICU), the per-application effectiveness of chlorhexidine and mupirocin were estimated using approximate Bayesian computation. Extended sensitivity analysis examined the potential impact of a latent period between MRSA colonization and detection, the timing of decolonization administration, and parameter uncertainty.

Results: The estimated per-application effectiveness of chlorhexidine was 0.15 (95% Credible Interval: 0.01, 0.42), while the estimated effectiveness of mupirocin was is 0.15 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.54). A lag in colonization detection markedly reduced both estimates, which were particularly sensitive to the value to the modeled contact rate between nurses and patients. Gaps longer than 24-hours in the administration of decolonizing agents still resulted in substantial reduction of within-ICU MRSA transmission.

Discussion: The per-application effectiveness estimates for chlorhexidine and mupirocin suggest there is room for substantial improvement in anti-MRSA disinfectants, either in the compounds themselves, or in their delivery mechanism. Despite these estimates, these agents are robust to
delays in administration, which may help in alleviating concerns over patient comfort or toxicity.","/content/10.1101/19012732v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012732v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Epidemiology

"Algorithmic discovery of dynamic models from infectious disease data","Theoretical models are typically developed through a deductive process where a researcher formulates a system of dynamic equations from hypothesized mechanisms, for instance.  However, recent advances in algorithmic methods are designed to discover sparse dynamic models inductively--directly from data--using minimal prior system knowledge. Most previous research has tested these methods by rediscovering models from synthetic data generated by the already known model. Here we apply Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to discover mechanistic equations for disease dynamics from case notification data for measles, chickenpox, and rubella.  The discovered models provide a good qualitative fit to the observed dynamics for all three diseases. Moreover, when SINDy uses a library of second-order functions, the discovered models tend to include mass action incidence and a seasonally forced transmission rate--a common feature of existing epidemiological models for childhood infectious diseases. We also show that the measles model discovered by SINDy is capable of out-of-sample prediction of a dynamical regime shift in measles case notification data. These results demonstrate the potential for algorithmic model discovery to enrich scientific understanding by providing a complementary approach to developing theoretical models.","/content/10.1101/19012724v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012724v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Can we predict early 7-day readmissions using a standard 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction model?","Despite focus on preventing 30-day readmissions, early readmissions (within 7 days of discharge) may be more preventable than later readmissions (8-30 days). We assessed how well a previously validated 30-day readmission prediction model predicts 7-day readmissions. We re-derived model coefficients for the same predictors as in the original 30-day model to optimize prediction of 7-day readmissions. We compared model performance and compared differences in strength of model factors between the 7-day model to the 30-day model. While there was no substantial change in model performance between the original 30-day and the re-derived 7-day model, there was significant change in strength of predictors. Characteristics at discharge were more predictive of 7-day readmissions, while baseline characteristics were less predictive. Improvements in predicting early 7-day readmissions will likely require new risk factors proximal to the day of discharge.","/content/10.1101/19012468v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012468v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Health Systems and Quality Improvement

"Patterns of self-medication among university students in San Jose, Costa Rica","Self-medication is defined as the use of drugs to treat self-diagnosed symptoms without the supervision of healthcare physicians. Self-medication is a growing public health phenomenon and is associated with risks such as misdiagnosis and drug toxicity. This study aimed to identify the patterns associated with the practice of self-medication among university students in San Jose, Costa Rica. A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed and conducted to identify variables associated. Information was collected on the conditions treated, medications used, and their sources. The study found that self-medication is highly prevalent among Costa Rican university students. 91.4% of the sample reported self-medicating, with each student consuming an average of 2.15,  1,08 drugs. The prevalence found is higher than that reported in previous studies conducted in the country. These findings suggest the need to implement prevention campaigns and regulatory policies to ensure the safe consumption of medical drugs.","/content/10.1101/19012047v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012047v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Public and Global Health

"Neurofilaments as blood biomarkers at the preataxic and ataxic stage of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3: a cross-species analysis in humans and mice","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a devastating multisystemic neurodegenerative disease for which targeted molecular therapies are coming into reach (e.g. antisense oligonucleotides). To pave the way for upcoming translational trials, easily accessible biomarkers in SCA3 are needed, particularly for subjects at the preataxic stage and cross-validated also in animal models. We hypothesised that serum neurofilaments might serve as blood biomarkers of disease progression in both human SCA3 and mouse models, expecting increased concentrations already at the preataxic stage. Serum neurofilament light (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH) levels were determined by ultra-sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) in cross-sectional samples of ataxic and preataxic SCA3 subjects and controls in two independent cohorts (ESMI cohort = cohort #1: n=160, EuroSCA/RiSCA cohort = cohort #2: n=89). Serum NfL and pNfH were also assessed in a 304Q SCA3 knock-in mouse model across presymptomatic and symptomatic disease stages (n=147). Ataxic SCA3 subjects showed increased serum NfL (p<0.001) and pNfH (p<0.001) levels in cohort #1, with NfL levels already increased in preataxic subjects (p<0.001). All these results were replicated in cohort #2 (all p<0.001). Cross-sectional NfL levels correlated with clinical disease severity (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia [SARA]; r=0.43, p<0.001) and with longitudinal disease progression (annual SARA score change, <U+03F1>=0.42, p=0.012). CAG count and age were significant predictors of individual NfL concentrations (each p<0.001). NfL levels in preataxic subjects increased with proximity to individual expected onset of ataxia (p<0.001), with significant elevations already 7.5 years before onset. Serum NfL and pNfH increases in SCA3 subjects were paralleled by similar changes in SCA3 knock-in mice, here also already starting at the presymptomatic stage and close to the onset of ataxin-3 protein increase. Serum concentrations of neurofilaments, particularly NfL, might provide easily accessible biomarkers of disease severity in both ataxic and preataxic SCA3 subjects and mice prior to conversion. Neurofilaments thus entail potential applications as progression, onset/proximity and treatment-response markers in both human and murine SCA3 trials.","/content/10.1101/19011882v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011882v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Neurology

"Reproductive Factors and Risk of Breast Cancer by Tumor Subtypes among Ghanaian Women: A Population-based Case-control Study","Background
Higher proportions of early onset and estrogen receptor (ER) negative cancers are observed in women of African ancestry than in women of European ancestry. Differences in risk factor distributions and associations by age at diagnosis and ER status may explain this disparity. 
Methods
We analyzed data from 1,126 women (aged 18 to 74 years) with invasive breast cancer and 2,106 population controls recruited from three hospitals in Ghana from 2013 to 2015. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for menstrual and reproductive factors using polytomous logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders.
Results
Among controls, medians for age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, and breastfeeding/pregnancy were 15 years, 4 births, 20 years, and 18 months, respectively. For women greater or equal to 50 years, parity and extended breastfeeding were associated with decreased risks: >5 births vs. nulliparous, OR 0.40 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.83) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.98) for greater or equal to 19 vs. <13 breastfeeding months/pregnancy, which did not differ by ER. In contrast, for earlier onset cases (<50 years) parity was associated with increased risk for ER-negative tumors (Pheterogeneity by ER = 0.02), which was offset by extended breastfeeding. Similar associations were observed by intrinsic-like subtypes. Less consistent relationships were observed with ages at menarche and first birth. 
Conclusion
Reproductive risk factor distributions are different from European populations but exhibited etiologic heterogeneity by age at diagnosis and ER status similar to other populations.","/content/10.1101/19006833v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006833v1.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Epidemiology

"Structural and functional MRI changes associated with cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease","Objective: Cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD) places a high burden on patients and the pathophysiological mechanisms that differentiate patients with cognitive impairment from those without it are still incompletely understood. 
Methods: We conducted a resting-state seed region-of-interest approach to investigate functional connectivity (FC) of important subdivisions of the caudate nucleus, putamen and thalamus in controls (n=33), cognitively unimpaired subjects (PD-CU, n=33), PD subjects with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, n=22) and subjects with dementia (PDD, n=17). We then investigated how the morphology of these structures differed between groups.
Results: PD-CU subjects, compared to controls, displayed increased and decreased FC of caudate, putamen and thalamic subdivisions. PD-MCI subjects demonstrated reduced FC of the mediodorsal thalamus with the paracingulate cortex, compared to PD-CU, and reduced FC of the mediodorsal thalamus with the posterior cingulate cortex compared to PDD. Extensive volumetric and surface-based deflation was found in subjects with dementia. 
Conclusions: Our research suggests that cognitive impairment and dementia in PD may be associated with a breakdown in FC of the mediodorsal thalamus with para- and posterior cingulate regions of the brain, respectively.
Significance: Cognitive impairment and dementia in PD may relate to pathophysiological changes in FC of the mediodorsal thalamus.","/content/10.1101/19002147v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002147v3.full.pdf","2019-11-27","Radiology and Imaging

"The role of synovial T-cell infiltration following knee joint injury in symptoms and progression to osteoarthritis","Objectives: Identification of osteoarthritis(OA)-specific synovial inflammatory pathways, and when in the clinical course they are active, is critical for their utility as therapeutic targets. We directly compared the mononuclear inflammatory/immune-cell responses following joint injury that does and does-not lead to OA, to define bona-fide OA-associated cellular events.   
Methods: We undertook detailed temporal flow-cytometric and mRNA expression analysis in mice after sham or medial-meniscal-destiblization (DMM) surgery. We compared this with patients with meniscal injury and OA, and evaluated the role of synovial monocytes/macrophages versus lymphocytes in catabolic metalloproteinase secrection in vitro. We determined the effect of transient acute or delayed systemic T-cell depletion on DMM-induced OA pathology. 
Results: OA-inducing/DMM and non-OA-inducing/Sham surgery had identical synovial monocyte/macrophage number, activation and polarization. The number and activation of synovial (not splenic or peripheral-blood) CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes was increased from 1-day after DMM versus Sham, and showed a persistent cyclical elevation throughout OA onset and progression. There was a temporal imbalance in synovial Th17/Treg and Th1/Th2 lymphocytes during DMM-induced OA initiation and progression. We confirmed early post-injury and late-OA CD3/CD8 T-cell responses in synovial tissues from patients, identified an association between CD8 and early post-injury symptoms, and defined a significant role for CD3+T-cells in synovial metalloproteinase secretion. Anti-CD3 cell-depletion studies in mice confirmed a key role for the earliest post-injury T-cell response in long-term OA pathology. 
Conclusions: We identify a hitherto unappreciated pathophysiological role of acute T-cell activation after joint injury in long-term post-traumatic OA risk, providing a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target.","/content/10.1101/19013227v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013227v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Rheumatology

"Interpreting chest X-rays via CNNs that exploit disease dependencies and uncertainty labels","Chest radiography is one of the most common types of diagnostic radiology exams, which is critical for screening and diagnosis of many different thoracic diseases. Specialized algorithms have been developed to detect several specific pathologies such as lung nodule or lung cancer. However, accurately detecting the presence of multiple diseases from chest X-rays (CXRs) is still a challenging task. This paper presents a supervised multi-label classification framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting the risk of 14 common thoracic diseases. We tackle this problem by training state-of-the-art CNNs that exploit dependencies among abnormality labels. We also propose to use the label smoothing technique for a better handling of uncertain samples, which occupy a significant portion of almost every CXR dataset. Our model is trained on over 200,000 CXRs of the recently released CheXpert dataset and achieves a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.940 in predicting 5 selected pathologies from the validation set. This is the highest AUC score yet reported to date. The proposed method is also evaluated on the independent test set of the CheXpert competition, which is composed of 500 CXR studies annotated by a panel of 5 experienced radiologists. The performance is on average better than 2.6 out of 3 other individual radiologists with a mean AUC of 0.930, which ranks first on the CheXpert leaderboard at the time of writing this paper.","/content/10.1101/19013342v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013342v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29",NA,"Pham","/highwire/citation/70454/bibtext",2,"301119-2","30/11/2019","70454"
"Quantitative Analysis of Ablation Technique Predicts Arrhythmia Recurrence Following Atrial Fibrillation Ablation","Background: Optimal ablation technique, including catheter-tissue contact during atrial fibrillation (AF) radiofrequency (RF) ablation is associated with improved procedural outcomes. We used a custom developed software to analyze high frequency catheter position data to study the interaction between catheter excursion during lesion placement, lesion-set sequentiality and arrhythmia recurrence.
Methods: 100 consecutive patients undergoing first time RF ablation for paroxysmal AF were analyzed. Spatial positioning of the ablation catheter sampled at 60 Hz during RF application was extracted from the CARTO3 system (Biosense Webster Inc., USA) and analyzed using custom developed MATLAB software to determine precise catheter spatial 3D excursion during RF ablation. The primary end point was freedom from atrial arrhythmia lasting longer than 30 seconds after a single ablation procedure.
Results: At one year, 86% of patients were free from recurrent arrhythmia. There was no significant difference in clinical, echocardiographic or ablation characteristics between patients with and without recurrent arrhythmia. Analyzing 15,356,998 position data-points revealed that lesion-set sequentiality and mean lesion catheter excursion were predictors of arrhythmia recurrence. Analyzing arrhythmia recurrence by mean single-lesion catheter excursion (excursion > 2.81mm) and by sequentiality (using 46% of lesions with inter-lesion distance >6mm as cutoff) revealed significantly increased arrhythmia recurrence in the higher excursion group (23% vs. 6%, p=0.03) and in the less sequential group (24% vs. 4%, p=0.02). 
Conclusion: Ablation lesion sequentiality measured by catheter inter-lesion distance and catheter stability measured by catheter excursion during lesion placement are potentially modifiable factors affecting arrhythmia recurrence after RF ablation for AF.","/content/10.1101/19013318v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013318v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Current practice and challenges in screening for visual perception deficits after stroke: a qualitative study","AIM: We aimed to document current clinical practice and needs in screening for visual perception problems after stroke to inform development of new screening tools.
METHODS: We interviewed 25 health care professionals (12 occupational therapists, 13 orthoptists) from 16 organisations in England. Interviews were transcribed and coded in NVivo Software. Data were thematically analysed using the Value Proposition Canvas, a model which establishes what people want to achieve, the challenges they face and what facilitates their jobs.
RESULTS: Participants' understanding of visual perception varied and often included sensory and cognitive deficits. Occupational therapists commonly screened for visual field deficits and hemispatial neglect, while other aspects of visual cognition were rarely assessed. They decided on referrals to orthoptists for further assessment. Screening generally occurred during functional assessments and/or with in-house developed tools. Challenges to practice were: lack of time, lack of training, environmental and stroke survivor factors (e.g. aphasia), insufficient continuation of care, and test characteristics (e.g. not evidence-based). Facilitators to practice were: quick and practical tools, experienced staff or tools with minimal training requirements, a streamlined care pathway between a stroke unit and eye hospital supported by occupational therapists and orthoptists. 
CONCLUSION: Screening employs non-standardised assessments and rarely covers visual perceptual deficits in higher order perception. Our service evaluation demonstrates the need for a standardised visual perception screen, which should ideally be 15 minutes or less, be portable, and require minimal equipment. The screen should be suitable for bedside testing in noisy environments, inclusive for participants with aphasia and evidence-based.","/content/10.1101/19013243v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013243v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Ophthalmology

"Social and Health Seeking Determinants of Antibiotic Use in Vietnamese Children Under 5: Analysis of National Household Survey Data","Background
Antibiotic resistance is an important global public health issue, perpetuated by increases in antibiotic use. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), tackling antibiotic resistance bacteria is especially challenging. Due to high rates of infectious disease and continuing high mortality from untreated bacterial infections, policy must balance tackling both antibiotic access and antibiotic overuse. This paper investigates the social and health-seeking determinants that impact appropriate and inappropriate antibiotic use in Vietnamese children under 5 for Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI). 

Methods
Descriptive analyses and logistic regression models were performed on country-wide household data from UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in 2006, 2011, 2014. 

Results
Results show that antibiotic overuse is higher in those who sought care from a healthcare provider than those who self-treated. In 2014, children who sought care at private facilities and government facilities were more likely to overuse antibiotics for mild respiratory infections (OR 6.1 and OR 3.8 respectively) than those who did not seek care at private and government facilities respectively. Furthermore, higher socioeconomic level was associated with both appropriate antibiotic use for pneumonia and inappropriate for mild ARI. Children in the poorest households in 2011 and 2014 were less likely to appropriately use antibiotics than those from other socioeconomic levels (OR 0.37 and 0.025 respectively). And children in the poorest households in 2014 were less likely to inappropriately use antibiotics for mild ARI than all other socioeconomic levels (OR 0.36).

Conclusions
These findings support, challenge, and broaden current understandings of antibiotic usage in Vietnam. Our results suggest that inappropriate antibiotic use arises from the provider and institutional level. Consequently, we argue that community education efforts and enforcing antibiotics as prescription-only is insufficient. Instead, more focus should be made on reducing financial incentives and infrastructural weaknesses at hospitals and health centres. Furthermore, our results show the need to provide the poorest households with sufficient access to antibiotics.  Health policy should tackle the issue of inappropriate use of antibiotics for mild ARI among higher socioeconomic groups.","/content/10.1101/19013292v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013292v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Epidemiology

"Schizophrenia polygenic risk score and cannabis use modify psychosis expression in first episode psychosis patients and population controls","Background
Diagnostic categories within the psychosis spectrum are widely used in clinical practice, however psychosis may occur on a continuum. Therefore, we explored whether the continuous distribution of psychotic symptoms across categories is a function of genetic as well as environmental risk factors, such as polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and cannabis use.
Methods
As part of the EU-GEI study, we genotyped first episode psychosis patients (FEP) and population controls, for whom transdiagnostic dimensions of psychotic symptoms or experiences were generated using item response bi-factor modelling. Linear regression was used, separately in patients and controls, to test the associations between these dimensions and schizophrenia (SZ) PRSs, as well as the combined effect of SZ-PRS and cannabis use on the positive symptom/experience dimensions. 
Results
SZ-PRS was associated with negative (B=0.18; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.34) and positive (B=0.19; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.36) symptom dimensions in 617 FEP, and with all the psychotic experience dimensions in 979 controls. The putative effect of SZ-PRS on either symptom or experience dimensions was of a small magnitude. Cannabis use was additionally associated with the positive dimensions both in FEP (B=0.31; 95%CI 0.11 to 0.52) and in controls (B=0.26; 95%CI 0.06 to 0.46), independently from SZ-PRS.
Conclusions
We report two validators to the latent dimensional structure of psychosis. SZ risk variants and cannabis use independently map onto specific dimensions, contributing to variation across the psychosis continuum. Findings support the hypothesis that psychotic experiences have similar biological substrates as clinical disorders.","/content/10.1101/19013284v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013284v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

Design and methods: A collective case study approach was used. Data collection included observational and interview data from three nursing homes, and a review of 224,200 resident admissions over a 3-year period in New Zealand. 
Participants: Twenty eight health care workers from three nursing homes in the North Island of New Zealand. 
Results: Despite a willingness by healthcare staff to care for older adults with extreme obesity, nursing homes were not well equipped to provide safe equitable care for this resident population. Key areas of concern for nursing homes related to limitations in the infrastructure, and financial barriers relating to government funded contracted care services which incorporated equipment procurement and safe staffing ratios.
Conclusion: Nursing homes are unprepared to accommodate the existing and increasing number of older adults with extreme obesity who will require bariatric specific care. Government agencies and policy makers will need to consider the financial implications of the increasing need for bariatric level support within aged care, as well as the impact on individual nursing home resources and quality of care provided. Considerable sector and government attention is needed in relation to infrastructure and funding, to allow for the provision of high quality, safe and equitable care for this population group.","/content/10.1101/19013326v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013326v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Health Systems and Quality Improvement

"Multimodal neuroimaging and suicidality in a US population-based sample of school-aged children","Background: Childhood suicidality is a major public health concern with poorly defined neurobiology, especially in young people. We sought to address this gap by examining multimodal brain imaging correlates of suicidality in a US population-based sample of school-aged children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study. 
Methods: Unrelated 9-10-year-olds (N=7,994) were subjected to a comprehensive assessment of individual, environmental and clinical characteristics, and underwent multimodal brain imaging. Given the sample size, we tested for both differences and equivalence of means in brain measures between children with endorsed suicidality, either by self- or/and caregiver-report, and never-suicidal children. 
Results: Passive suicidal ideation was the most prevalence expression of suicidality. Children endorsing suicidality evidenced higher levels of individual and parental psychopathology and reported higher rates of stressful life-events and family adversity. No robust associations were observed between suicidality and any neuroimaging modality.
Conclusions: Vulnerability to suicidality in young children does not appear to have a discrete brain signature when considering macro-scale brain measures. The longitudinal design of the ABCD will allow us to test whether such a signature may become established during adolescent development.","/content/10.1101/19013193v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013193v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Metagenomic analysis of common intestinal diseases reveals relationships among microbial signatures and powers multi-disease diagnostic models","Intestinal diseases can share clinical symptoms and gut microbiome alterations, necessitating cross-disease comparisons and the use of multi-disease models. Here, we performed meta-analyses on fecal metagenomes of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer (CRC), and identified 65 marker species and 74 marker pathways that were significantly altered in >=2 studies of the same disease. We grouped marker species by their co-occurrences into disease-specific and mixed clusters according to whether all the cluster members belong to the same disease, and revealed their distinct phylogenetic relationships: species in disease-specific clusters are phylogenetically related, while those in mixed clusters are more distant; strikingly, UC- and CRC-specific species are phylogenetically closer than to CD-specific ones, likely because UC-patients have higher risk of CRC. Consistent to their phylogenetic relationships, marker species had similar within-cluster and different between-cluster metabolic preferences. In CD and CRC, most marker species correlated with an indicator of leaky gut, suggesting a link between gut dysbiosis and human derived contents. In fact, our results suggested that due to physio-metabolic alterations, the diseased gut may represent a stressed environment and pose stronger selection to gut microbes; consequently, marker species in diseases showed more coordinated changes than the controls. With the marker species and pathways, we constructed three high-performance (including multi-disease) models with AUROC of 0.88 and true positive rates up to 89%, and explained their putative clinical applications. Together, our results improved our understanding on the relationships among common intestinal diseases, and strongly support the feasibility of metagenome-based multi-disease diagnosis.","/content/10.1101/19013136v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013136v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Gastroenterology

"Quality of life in cancer patients treated with mistletoe: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Mistletoe extracts are used as an adjunct therapy for cancer patients, but there is dissent as to whether this therapy has a positive impact on quality of life (QoL). 
Methods: We conducted a systematic review searching in several databases (Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Science Citation Index, clinicaltrials.gov, opengrey.org) by combining terms that cover the fields of 'neoplasm', 'quality of life' and 'mistletoe'. We included prospective controlled trials that compared mistletoe extracts with a control in cancer patients and reported QoL or related dimensions. The quality of the studies was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2.We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis.
Results: We included 26 publications with 30 data sets. The studies were heterogeneous. The pooled standardized mean difference (random effects model) for global QoL after treatment with mistletoe extracts vs. control was d = 0.61 (95% CI 0.41-0.81; p<0,001). The effect was stronger for younger patients, with longer treatment, in studies with lower risk of bias, in randomized and blinded studies. Sensitivity analyses support the validity of the finding. 50% of the QoL subdomains (e.g. pain, nausea) show a significant improvement after mistletoe treatment. Most studies have a high risk of bias or at least raise some concern.
Conclusion: Mistletoe extracts produce a significant, medium-sized effect on QoL in cancer. Risk of bias in the analyzed studies is likely due to the specific type of treatment, which is difficult to blind; yet this risk is unlikely to affect the outcome.","/content/10.1101/19013177v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013177v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Oncology

"Predicting dengue importation into Europe, using machine learning and model-agnostic methods.","The geographical spread of dengue is a global public health concern. This is largely mediated by the importation of dengue from endemic to non-endemic areas via the increasing connectivity of the global air transport network. The dynamic nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of the air transport network make it challenging to predict dengue importation. 
Here, we explore the capabilities of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to predict dengue importation. We trained four machine learning classifiers algorithms, using a 6-year historical dengue importation data for 21 countries in Europe and connectivity indices mediating importation and air transport network centrality measures. Predictive performance for the classifiers was evaluated using the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity measures. Finally, we applied practical model-agnostic methods, to provide in-depth explanation of our optimal model's predictions on a global and local scale. 

Our best performing model achieved high predictive accuracy, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic score of 0.94 and a maximized sensitivity score of 0.88. The predictor variables identified as most important were the source country's dengue incidence rate, population size, and volume of air passengers. Network centrality measures, describing the positioning of European countries within the air travel network, were also influential to the predictions. 

We demonstrated the high predictive performance of a machine learning model in predicting dengue importation and the utility of the model-agnostic methods to offer a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind the predictions. Similar approaches can be utilized in the development of an operational early warning surveillance system for dengue importation.","/content/10.1101/19013383v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013383v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Public and Global Health

In 2016, 12.4 million current asthmatics (46.9%) in the U.S. had at least one asthma exacerbation in the previous year. 
Objective: The objectives of this study were to predict the risk of asthma exacerbations and to explore potential risk factors involved in progressive asthma.
Methods: We proposed a time-sensitive attentive neural network to predict asthma exacerbation using clinical variables from electronic health records (EHRs). The clinical variables were collected from the Cerner Health Facts database between 1992 and 2015 including 31,433 asthmatic adult patients. Interpretations of both the patient level and the cohort level were investigated based on the model parameters. 
Results: The proposed model obtains an AUC value of 0.7003 through 5-fold cross-validation, which outperforms the baseline methods. The results also demonstrate that the addition of elapsed time embeddings considerably improves the performance on this dataset. Through further analysis, it was witnessed that risk factors behaved distinctly along the timeline and across patients. We also found supporting evidence from peer-reviewed literature for some possible cohort-level risk factors such as respiratory syndromes and esophageal reflux.
Conclusions: The proposed time-sensitive attentive neural network is superior to traditional machine learning methods and performs better than state-of-the-art deep learning methods in realizing effective predictive models for the prediction of asthma exacerbation. We believe that the interpretation and visualization of risk factors can help the clinical community to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the disease progression.","/content/10.1101/19012161v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012161v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Health Informatics

"The Project for Objective Measures Using Computational Psychiatry Technology (PROMPT): Rationale, Design, and Methodology","Background: 
Depressive and neurocognitive disorders are debilitating conditions that account for the leading causes of years lived with disability worldwide. Overcoming these disorders is an extremely important public health problem today. However, there are no biomarkers that are objective or easy-to-obtain in daily clinical practice, which leads to difficulties in assessing treatment response and developing new drugs. Due to advances in technology, it has become possible to quantify important features that clinicians perceive as reflective of disorder severity. Such features include facial expressions, phonic/speech information, body motion, daily activity, and sleep. The overall goal of this proposed study, the Project for Objective Measures Using Computational Psychiatry Technology (PROMPT), is to develop objective, noninvasive, and easy-to-use biomarkers for assessing the severity of depressive and neurocognitive disorders.
Methods: 
This is a multi-center prospective study. DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and major and minor neurocognitive disorders are inclusion criteria for the depressive and neurocognitive disorder samples. Healthy samples are confirmed to have no history of psychiatric disorders by Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and have no current cognitive decline based on the Mini Mental State Examination. Participants go through approximately 10-minute interviews with a psychiatrist/psychologist, where participants talk about non-specific topics such as everyday living, symptoms of disease, hobbies, etc. Interviews are recorded using RGB and infrared cameras, and an array microphone. As an option, participants are asked to wear wrist-band type devices during the observational period. The interviews take place =10 times within up to five years of follow-up. Various software is used to process the raw video, voice, infrared, and wearable device data. A machine learning approach is used to predict the presence of symptoms, severity, and the improvement/deterioration of symptoms.
Discussion: 
The PROMPT goal is to develop objective digital biomarkers for assessing the severity of depressive and neurocognitive disorders in the hopes of guiding decision-making in clinical settings as well as reducing the risk of clinical trial failure. Challenges may include the large variability of samples, which makes it difficult to extract the features that commonly reflect disorder severity.

"Examining the burden of opioid prescribing for non-cancer pain considering socio-economic differences, in Wales. A retrospective database study examining trends between 2005 and 2015","Objectives: 
To use a proxy-measure of oral morphine equivalent dose (OMED) to determine trends in opioid burden in people with non-cancer pain and explore differences related to deprivation status.
Design, setting and participants:
Retrospective cohort study using cross-sectional and longitudinal trend analyses of opioid prescribing data from 78% of Welsh Primary Care General Practices, whose data is shared with the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank. Anonymised data for the period 2005 to 2015, for people aged 18 or over, without a recorded cancer diagnosis and who received at least one prescription for an opioid medicine was included. 
Primary and Secondary outcomes:
A proxy-measure of oral morphine equivalence dose (OMED) was used to describe trends in opioid burden over the study period. OMED burden was stratified by 8 drug groups and deprivation, based on the quintile measures of the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2011 (WIMD2011).
Result:
In the 11 years examined, 22 641 424 prescriptions for opioids were issued from 345 primary care general practices in Wales. Daily OMED per 1000 population increased by 94.7% (from 16 266 mg to 31 665 mg). Twenty-eight percent of opioid prescribing occurred in the most deprived quintile. More than 100 000 000mg more OMED was prescribed in the most deprived areas of Wales, compared to the least deprived. Codeine prescribing accounted for 35% of the OMED burden in Wales over the study period.
Conclusions:
Whilst opioid prescription numbers increased 44% between 2005 and 2015, the OMED burden nearly doubled, with a disproportionate OMED load in the most deprived communities in Wales. Using OMED provides an insightful representation of opioid burden, more so than prescription numbers alone. Socio-economic differences are likely to affect pain presentation, access to support services and increase the likelihood of receiving an opioid prescription.","/content/10.1101/19012625v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012625v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29",NA,"Davies","/highwire/citation/70415/bibtext",14,"301119-14","30/11/2019","70415"
"Obstetrical safety indicators for preventing hospital harms: a scoping review protocol","Introduction: Optimizing the safety of obstetric patient care is a primary concern for many hospitals. Identifying performance indicators that measure aspects of patient care processes related to preventable harms can present opportunities to improve health systems.
In this paper, we present our protocol for a scoping review to identify performance indicators for obstetric safety. We aim to identify a comprehensive list of obstetric safety indicators which may help reduce the number of preventable patient harms, to summarize the data and to synthesize the results.

Methods and analysis: We will use the methodological framework described by Arksey and O Malley and further expanded by Levac. We will search multiple electronic databases such as Medline, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library as well as websites from professional bodies and other organisations, using an iterative search strategy. We will include indicators that relate to preventable harms in the process of obstetric care.
Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts of search results to determine eligibility for inclusion. For records where eligibility is not clear, the reviewers will screen the full text version. If reviewers decisions regarding eligibility differ, a third reviewer will review the full text record. Two reviewers will independently extract data from records that meet our inclusion criteria using a standardized data collection form. We will narratively describe quantitative data, such as the frequency with which indicators are identified, and conduct a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We will compile a comprehensive list of patient safety indicators identified during our scoping review and organise them according to concepts that best suit the data such as the Donabedian model or the Hospital Harm Framework. We will discuss the implications of the indicators for future research, clinical practice and policy making.
We will report the conduct of the review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA ScR) Checklist.

Ethics and Dissemination: The sources of information included in this scoping review will be available to the public. Therefore, ethical review for this research is not warranted. We will disseminate our research results using multiple modes of delivery such as a peer-reviewed publication, conference presentations and stakeholder communications.

"Polygenic background modifies penetrance of monogenic variants conferring risk for coronary artery disease, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer","Background: Genetic variation can predispose to disease both through (i) monogenic risk variants in specific genes that disrupt a specific physiologic pathway and have a large effect on disease risk and (ii) polygenic risk that involves large numbers of variants of small effect that affect many different pathways. Few studies have explored the interaction between monogenic risk variants and polygenic risk.

Methods: We identified monogenic risk variants and calculated polygenic scores for three diseases, coronary artery disease, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, in three study populations - case-control cohorts for coronary artery disease (UK Biobank; N=12,879) and breast cancer (Color Genomics; N=19,264), and an independent cohort of 49,738 additional UK Biobank participants. 

Results: In the coronary artery disease case-control cohort, increased risk for carriers of a monogenic variant ranged from 1.3-fold for those in the lowest polygenic score quintile to 12.6-fold for those in the highest. For breast cancer, increased risk ranged from 2.4 to 6.9-fold across polygenic score quintiles. Among the 49,738 UK Biobank participants who carried a monogenic risk variant, the probability of disease at age 75 years was strongly modified by polygenic risk. Across individuals in the lowest to highest percentiles of polygenic risk, the probability of disease ranged from 17% to 78% for coronary artery disease; 13% to 76% for breast cancer; and 11% to 80% for colon cancer.

Conclusions: For three important genomic conditions, polygenic risk powerfully modifies the risk conferred by monogenic risk variants.","/content/10.1101/19013086v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013086v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Population based targeted sequencing of 54 candidate genes identifies PALB2 as a susceptibility gene for high grade serous ovarian cancer","Purpose:  The known EOC susceptibility genes account for less than 50% of the heritable risk of ovarian cancer suggesting other susceptibility genes exist.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution to ovarian cancer susceptibility of rare deleterious germline variants in a set of candidate genes.
Methods: We sequenced the coding region of 54 candidate genes in 6385 invasive EOC cases and 6115 controls of broad European ancestry.  Genes with an increased frequency of putative deleterious variants in cases verses controls were further examined in an independent set of 14,146 EOC cases and 28,661 controls from the ovarian cancer association consortium and the UK Biobank.  For each gene, we estimated the EOC risks and evaluated associations between germline variant status and clinical characteristics.
Results:  The odds ratios (OR) associated for high-grade serous ovarian cancer were 3.01 for PALB2 (95% CI 1.59-5.68; P = 0.00068), 1.99 for POLK (95% CI 1.15-3.43; P = 0.014), and 4.07 for SLX4 (95% CI 1.34-12.4; P = 0.013).  Deleterious mutations in FBXO10 were associated with a reduced risk of disease (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07-1.00, P=0.049).  However, based on the Bayes false discovery probability, only the association for PALB2 in high-grade serous ovarian cancer is likely to represent a true positive. 
Conclusions:  We have found strong evidence that carriers of PALB2 deleterious mutations are at increased risk of high-grade serous ovarian cancer.  Whether the magnitude of risk is sufficiently high to warrant the inclusion of PALB2 in cancer gene panels for ovarian cancer risk testing is unclear; much larger sample sizes will be needed to provide sufficiently precise estimates for clinical counselling.","/content/10.1101/19011924v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011924v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Does the metabolic syndrome exist? The identification of cardio-metabolic profiles in a South Asian population study","OBJECTIVE
Research testing the validity of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) as a clinical construct associated with cardiovascular disease risk has produced inconsistent results. This study tested the existence of the MetS, explored alternative cardiometabolic risk characterisations, and examined the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors in a South Asian sample. 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Data came from the Colombo Twin and Singleton follow-up Study, CoTaSS-2 (N=3969). Latent class analysis tested the clustering of MetS indicators (waist circumference, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), medications and diabetes). Regression analyses tested cross-sectional associations between identified latent classes and covariates. Structural equation modelling estimated genetic and environmental influences on these classes. Analyses were stratified by gender (n=1681 men, n=2288 women).  
RESULTS
Three classes were identified in men: 1) ""Healthy"" (52.3%), 2) ""Central obesity, high TG, high FPG"" (40.2%), and 3) ""Central obesity, high TG, diabetes"" (7.6%). Four classes were identified in women: 1) ""Healthy"" (53.2%), 2) ""Very high central obesity, low HDL-C, raised FPG"" (32.8%), 3) ""Very high central obesity, diabetes"" (7.2%) and 4) ""Central obesity, hypertension, raised FPG"" (6.8%). Older age in men and women, and high socioeconomic status in men, was associated with cardiometabolic risk categories, compared to the ""Healthy"" classes.  In men, individual differences in cardiometabolic class membership were due to environmental effects. In females, genetic differences significantly predicted class membership. 
CONCLUSIONS
The findings did not support the MetS construct. Instead, distinct clinical profiles were identified in men and women, suggesting different aetiological pathways.","/content/10.1101/19012195v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012195v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Compromised intestinal barrier underlies gut microbiota dysbiosis of intestinal diseases","Despite recent efforts, a single factor underlying the gut microbiota dysbiosis in intestinal diseases is not identified. We hypothesized that compromised intestinal barrier (CIB) could lead to increased host-derived contents including human cells in the gut, change its physio-metabolic properties, and globally alter gut microbiota and their metabolic capacities. Consistently, we found human DNA contents (HDCs), calculated as the percentage of metagenomic sequencing reads mapped to the human genome, were significantly elevated in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients; HDC correlated with microbial- and metabolic-pathway-biomarkers of CRC, and was the most important contributor to patient stratification. We found similar results in Crohn's disease (CD); additionally, patients treated with diet and drug intervention showed reduced HDC levels over time, and were accompanied by reversing changes of many CD-signature species. Our results suggested that host-derived contents may have greater impact on gut microbiota than previously anticipated, and CIB could be an ideal treatment target that could reverse dysbiosis globally and precisely.","/content/10.1101/19011833v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011833v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Gastroenterology

"Hexamaps for Visualizing Age-Period-Cohort Data Trends","Age-period-cohort (APC) analyses often reveal important insights into patterns of disease incidence and mortality such as cancer.  Both visual and analytical APC tools are available to reveal patterns by age, period and cohort.  While developing new analytical methods of APC data is an active area of research, the choices of visual tools specific to APC data has been limited.  In this study, we propose a hexamap as a new APC specific data visualization tool.  This tool uses hexagons to address the unique challenge of APC data visualization, that is cohort = period - age.  The approach is further illustrated using alcohol related mortality. Flexible Open-Source functions for implementation in R is also provided.","/content/10.1101/19011700v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011700v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Epidemiology

"Using the Association Between Antibiotic Susceptibility and Genetic Relatedness to Rescue Old Drugs for Empiric Use","Background: Rising rates of antibiotic resistance have led to the use of broader spectrum antibiotics and increasingly compromise empiric therapy. Knowing the antibiotic susceptibility of a pathogens close genetic relative(s) may improve empiric antibiotic selection. 

Methods: Using genomic and phenotypic data from three separate clinically-derived databases of Escherichia coli isolates, we evaluated multiple genomic methods and statistical models for predicting antibiotic susceptibility, focusing on potentially rapidly available information such as lineage or genetic distance from archived isolates. We applied these methods to derive and validate prediction of antibiotic susceptibility to common antibiotics.

Results: We evaluated 968 separate episodes of suspected and confirmed infection with Escherichia coli from three geographically and temporally separated databases in Ontario, Canada, from 2010-2018. The most common sequence type (ST) was ST131 (30%).  Antibiotic susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were lowest (<=72%). Across all approaches, model performance (AUC) ranges for predicting antibiotic susceptibility were greatest for ciprofloxacin (0.76-0.97), and lowest for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (0.51-0.80). When a model predicted a susceptible isolate, the resulting (post-test) probabilities of susceptibility were sufficient to warrant empiric therapy for most antibiotics (mean 92%). An approach combining multiple models could permit the use of narrower spectrum oral agents in 2 out of every 3 patients while maintaining high treatment adequacy (approximately 90%).    

Conclusions: Methods based on genetic relatedness to archived samples in E. coli could be used to rescue older and typically unsuitable agents for use as empiric antibiotic therapy, as well as improve decisions to select newer broader spectrum agents.","/content/10.1101/19006106v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006106v1.full.pdf","2019-11-29","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"rs641738C>T near MBOAT7 promotes steatosis, NASH, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a meta-analysis","A common genetic variant near MBOAT7 (rs641738C>T) has been previously associated with hepatic fat and advanced histology in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), however these findings have not been consistently replicated in the literature. Therefore, we aimed to establish whether rs641738 is a risk factor for NAFLD through meta-analysis. Data from 131,096 participants (7,692 with liver biopsies and 45,419 with imaging) was included in the meta-analysis. The minor T-allele of rs641738C>T was associated with higher liver fat on CT/MRI using an additive genetic model (+0.05 standard deviations [95% CI: 0.01,0.09], p=0.025), and with an increased risk of NAFLD (per-allele OR: 1.09 [95% CI: 1.01,1.17]), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (OR: 1.11 [95% CI: 1.02,1.21]), advanced fibrosis (OR: 1.14 [95% CI: 1.05,1.23]), and hepatocellular carcinoma (OR: 1.43 [95% CI: 1.22,1.67]) in adults with NAFLD. Sub-group analysis did not demonstrate a difference in Caucasians and non-Caucasians. Rs641738C>T was not associated with markers of insulin resistance but was associated with higher risk of stroke in the UK Biobank. These data validate rs641738C>T near MBOAT7 as a risk factor for the development, activity, and stage of NAFLD including hepatocellular carcinoma.","/content/10.1101/19013623v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013623v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04",NA,"Teo","/highwire/citation/70493/bibtext",1,"051219-1","05/12/2019","70493"
"The genetic and clinical landscape of nanophthalmos in an Australian cohort","Purpose: Refractive error is caused by a disparity between the axial length and focusing power of the eye. Nanophthalmos is a rare ocular abnormality in which both eyes are abnormally small, typically causing extreme hyperopic refractive error, and associated with an increased risk of angle-closure glaucoma.
Methods: A cohort of 40 individuals from 13 unrelated nanophthalmos kindreds were recruited, with 11 probands subjected to exome sequencing.
Results: Nine probands (69.2%) were assigned a genetic diagnosis, with variants in PRSS56 (4), MFRP (3), and previously reported variants in TMEM98 (1) and MYRF (1). Two of the four PRSS56 probands harboured the previously described c.1066dupC frameshift variant implicated in over half of all reported PRSS56 kindreds, with surrounding haplotypes distinct from each other, and from a previously reported Tunisian c.1066dupC haplotype. Individuals with a genetic diagnosis had shorter mean axial lengths (P=7.22x10-9) and more extreme hyperopia (P=0.0005) than those without a genetic diagnosis, with recessive forms associated with the shortest axial lengths and highest hyperopia. All individuals with an axial length below 18 mm in their smaller eye (17/17) were assigned a genetic diagnosis.
Conclusions: These findings detail the genetic architecture of nanophthalmos in an Australian cohort of predominantly European ancestry, their relative clinical phenotypes, and highlight the shared genetic architecture of rare and common disorders of refractive error.","/content/10.1101/19013599v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013599v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04",NA,"Siggs","/highwire/citation/70492/bibtext",2,"051219-2","05/12/2019","70492"
"Alien limb in the corticobasal syndrome: phenomenological characteristics and relationship to apraxia","Alien limb refers to movements that seem purposeful but are independent of patients' reported intentions. Alien limb often co-occurs with apraxia in the corticobasal syndrome, and anatomical and phenomenological comparisons have led to the suggestion that alien limb and apraxia may be causally related as failures of goal-directed movements. Here, we characterised the nature of alien limb symptoms in patients with the corticobasal syndrome (n=30) and their relationship to limb apraxia. Twenty-five patients with progressive supranuclear palsy Richardson syndrome served as a disease-control group. Structured examinations of praxis, motor function, cognition and alien limb were undertaken in patients attending a regional specialist clinic. Twenty-eight patients with corticobasal syndrome (93%) demonstrated significant apraxia and this was often asymmetrical, with the left hand preferentially affected in 77% of patients. Moreover, 83% reported one or more symptoms consistent with alien limb. The range of these phenomena was broad, including changes in the sense of ownership and control as well as unwanted movements. Regression analyses showed no significant association between the severity of limb apraxia and both the occurrence of an alien limb and the number of alien limb phenomena reported. Bayesian estimation showed a low probability for a positive association between alien limb and apraxia, suggesting that alien limb phenomena are not likely to be related to severe apraxia. Our results shed light on the phenomenology of these disabling and as yet untreatable clinical features, with relevance to theoretical models of voluntary action.","/content/10.1101/19013607v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013607v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04",NA,"Lewis-Smith","/highwire/citation/70491/bibtext",3,"051219-3","05/12/2019","70491"
"Null effect of circulating sphingomyelins on risk for breast cancer: a Mendelian randomization report using Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) data.","Background. Changes in cellular metabolism are a hallmark of cancer and are linked with sphingolipid synthesis. Due to immense interest in how sphingolipids influence chemoresistance, more is known about the impact of sphingolipids during cancer treatment and progression than about the potential role of sphingolipids in the induction of tumors in humans.

Methods. Because estrogen triggers sphingolipid signaling cascades, the causal role of circulating levels of sphingomyelin (a type of sphingolipid) on breast cancer was investigated with a well-powered Mendelian randomization design.

Results. The results reveal a null effect (OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.85, 1.05; P = 0.30).

Conclusion. Despite the role sphingomyelins play during chemoresistance and cancer progression, circulating sphingomyelins do not appear to initiate or protect from breast cancer.

Impact. This finding comprises the first causal report in humans that sphingomyelins on breast cancer initiation is null. Future investigations of risk in other cancer types are needed to further explore the potential role of sphingolipid biology in cancer etiology.","/content/10.1101/19013540v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013540v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04",NA,"Adams","/highwire/citation/70489/bibtext",4,"051219-4","05/12/2019","70489"
"How do interventions impact malaria dynamics between neighboring countries? A case study with Botswana and Zimbabwe","Malaria is a vector-borne disease that is responsible for over 400,000 deaths per year. Although many countries world wide have taken measures to decrease the incidence of malaria many regions remain endemic, and in some parts of the world malaria incidence is increasing. While control efforts are largely focused at national levels, the movement of individuals between countries may complicate the efficacy of elimination efforts. Here, we consider the case of neighboring countries Botswana and Zimbabwe, connected by human mobility. Both have improved malaria rates in recent years, but are not yet reached elimination. We use a two-patch Ross-MacDonald Model with Lagrangian human mobility to examine the coupled disease dynamics between these two countries. In particular, we are interested in the impact that interventions for controlling malaria applied in one country can have on the incidence of malaria in another country. We find that dynamics and interventions in Zimbabwe can dramatically influence pathways to elimination in Botswana, largely driven by Zimbabwe's population size and larger basic reproduction number.","/content/10.1101/19013631v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013631v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04",NA,"Agusto","/highwire/citation/70490/bibtext",5,"051219-5","05/12/2019","70490"
"HIV-1 founder variant multiplicity is determined by the infection stage of the source partner","During sexual transmission, the large genetic diversity of HIV-1 within an individual is frequently reduced to one founder variant that initiates infection. Understanding the drivers of this bottleneck is crucial to develop effective infection control strategies. Genetic characteristics of the potential founder viruses and events in the recipient partner are both known to contribute to this bottleneck, but little is understood about the importance of the source partner.  To test the hypothesis that the source partner affects the multiplicity of HIV founder variants, we developed a phylodynamic model calibrated using genetic and epidemiological data on all existing transmission pairs for whom the direction of transmission and the infection stage of the source partner are known. Our results demonstrate the importance of infection stage of the source partner, and not exposure route, in determining founder variant multiplicity. Specifically, acquiring infection from someone in the acute (early) stage of infection increases the risk of multiple variant transmission when compared with someone in the chronic (later) stage of infection. This study provides the first direct test of source partner characteristics to explain the low frequency of multiple founder strain infections and can inform clinical intervention study design and interpretation.","/content/10.1101/19013524v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013524v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04",NA,"Villabona-Arenas","/highwire/citation/70485/bibtext",6,"051219-6","05/12/2019","70485"
"Independently Carriage of IL-1RN*2 Allele Associated with Increased Risk of Gastric Cancer in The Sudanese Population.","Background: Helicobacter pylori is responsible for gastric cancer in approximately tens of millions of patients. Gastric cancer in Sudan represents one of the top causing death among cancers with about 686 cases per year and a 2.7 % mortality rate. IL-1RN VNTR polymorphism has been reported to increase the risk of gastric cancer.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the association of the 86 bp VNTR polymorphism of IL- 1RN gene and the susceptibility to H. pylori infection and gastric cancer in the Sudanese population.
Materials and methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from 114 subjects. Of whom 60 had gastritis and duodenitis, 26 had a peptic ulcer, 16 had gastric cancer and 12 had normal gastroscopy findings. H. pylori infection was investigated by specific 16S rRNA. And IL-1RN VNTR polymorphism at intron 2 was genotyped using the PCR method and direct sequencing for random samples. 
Results: The positive H. pylori infection rate among participants was 47.37%. There is a lack of a significant difference in IL- 1RN genotype with H. pylori infection (p-value=1.0000). The IL-1 RN L/L genotype was significantly more frequent in a patient with benign disorders (gastritis or duodenitis or peptic ulcer), Odd=6.000 (95% CI =1.750-20.57, P=0.0056). While the heterozygote genotype 2/L was associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer with OR = 12.83 (95% CI = 1.261-130.6, P=0.0302).
Conclusion: Independently carriage of IL-1RN *2 allele was associated with increased risk of gastric cancer in the Sudanese population. Notwithstanding the relatively small sample size of the study population, our findings show that the host genetic can be a useful tool for identifying high-risk individuals among dyspeptic patients; and also underscore the role played by host genetics in gastric carcinogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in Sudan concerning this issue.","/content/10.1101/19013573v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013573v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04",NA,"Idris","/highwire/citation/70486/bibtext",7,"051219-7","05/12/2019","70486"
"Predictors of health related quality of life among diabetic patients on follow up at Nekemte Specialized Hospital, Western Ethiopia: A cross sectional study","Abstract
Objective: To assess health related quality of life (HRQoL) and its predictors among diabetic patients on follow up at Nekemte Specialized Hospital (NSH) in Western Ethiopia.
Design, setting and participants: This facility based cross sectional study was conducted among 224 diabetic patients on follow up at one of the public hospitals in western Ethiopia.
Main outcome measured: HRQoL was measured by using the Medical Outcome Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey from 15th April to 5th June. Structured questionnaire was used for data the collection from participants selected by systematic random sampling. Multiple linear regression was used for final model. 
Result: A total of 215 diabetic patients were involved in the study with the response rate of 96%. The mean score of the overall HRQoL of the study participants was found to be 50.30 with standard deviation of 18.08 with highest mean score in physical functioning and lowest mean score in general health domain. Age, education status, history of smoking, feeling of stigmatized and Body mass index (BMI) were inversely associated while being male, being married, absence of co morbidity and absence of chronic complications related to diabetes mellitus were found to be positively associated with overall HRQoL.
Conclusion: The overall HRQoL of diabetic patients on follow up at the study area was found to be moderate. General health, mental health, bodily pain and vitality were the most affected domains. Both the mental and physical components need to be considered when caring the diabetic patients on follow up beyond provision of treatment.

"Severe volcanic SO2 exposure and respiratory morbidities in the Icelandic population - a register study","Background 
The Holuhraun volcanic eruption September 2014 to February 2015 emitted large amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2). 
Objectives
The aim of this study was to determine the association between volcanic SO2 gases on general population respiratory health in the Icelandic capital area some 250 km from the eruption site. 
Methods
Respiratory health outcomes were: asthma medication dispensing (AMD) from the Icelandic Medicines Register, medical doctor consultations in primary care (PCMD) and hospital emergency department visits (HED) in Reykjavik (population: 215 000) for respiratory disease from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2014. The associations between daily counts of health events, and daily mean SO2 concentration and high SO2 levels (24-hour mean SO2 >125<U+03BD>g/m3) were analyzed using generalized additive models.
Results	
After the eruption began, AMD was higher than before (129.4 vs. 158.4 individuals per day, p<0.05). Increases in SO2 concentration were associated with an estimated increase in AMD by 1.05% (95% CI 0.48 - 1.62%) per 10 <U+03BD>g/m3 at lag 0-2, 1.51% (95% CI 0.63 - 2.40%) increase in individuals under 18 years of age. PCMD for respiratory causes increased by 1.52% (95% CI 1.04 - 2.00%) per 10 <U+03BD>g/m3 SO2 at lag 0-2. For HED, only effect estimated for individuals aged 64 years and older were significantly increased, by 1.541% (95% CI 0.02 - 3.07%) per 10 <U+03BD>g/m3 SO2 at lag 0-2. Following days with SO2 levels above 125 <U+03BD>g/m3, AMD and PCMD were increased in all age groups, in AMD mostly so in individuals under 18 by 20.4%(95%CI 4.8 - 23.4%), and adult PCMD visits by 24.1%(95%CI 16.8 - 31.3%). HED was significantly increased in elderly by 26.3% (95%CI 5.56-47.0). 
Discussion
High levels of volcanic SO2 are associated with increases in dispensing of AMD, and health care utilization in primary and tertiary care. Individuals with prevalent respiratory disease may be particularly susceptible.","/content/10.1101/19013474v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013474v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04",NA,"Carlsen","/highwire/citation/70481/bibtext",9,"051219-9","05/12/2019","70481"
"Cortical complexity analyses and their cognitive correlate in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia","The changes of cortical structure in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are usually described in terms of atrophy. However, neurodegenerative diseases may also affect the complexity of cortical shape, such as the fractal dimension of the brain surface. Thirty-two people with symptomatic AD-pathology (clinically probable AD, n=18, and amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment, n=14), 24 with FTD and 28 healthy controls underwent high-resolution 3T structural brain MRI. Using surface-based morphometry, we created vertex-wise cortical thickness and fractal dimension maps for group comparisons and correlations with cognitive measures in AD and FTD. In addition to the well-established pattern of cortical thinning encompassing temporoparietal regions in AD and frontotemporal areas in FTD (FDR p	< 0.05), we observed reductions of fractal dimension specifically involving precuneus and posterior cingulate for AD and orbitofrontal cortex and insula for FTD. Correlational analyses between fractal dimension and cognition showed that these regions were particularly vulnerable with regards to memory and language impairment in both AD and FTD. This study demonstrates a distinct pattern of fractal dimension impairment and correlation with cognition. Further studies are required to assess cortical complexity measures at earlier disease stages (e.g. in prodromal/ asymptomatic carriers of FTD-related gene mutations) to assess whether fractal dimension represents a sensitive imaging marker for prevention and diagnostic strategies.","/content/10.1101/19013466v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013466v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04",NA,"Nicastro","/highwire/citation/70478/bibtext",10,"051219-10","05/12/2019","70478"
"Word embeddings trained on published case reports are lightweight,effective for clinical tasks, and free of protected health information","Rationale: Word embeddings are used to create vector representations of text data but not all embeddings appropriately capture clinical information, are free of protected health information, and are computationally accessible to most researchers.

Methods: We trained word embeddings on published case reports because their language mimics that of clinical notes, the manuscripts are already de-identified by virtue of being published, and the corpus is much smaller than those trained on large, publicly available datasets. We tested the performance of these embeddings across five clinically relevant tasks and compared the results to embeddings trained on a large Wikipedia corpus, all publicly available manuscripts, notes from the MIMIC-III database using fastText, GloVe, and word2vec, and using different dimensions. Tasks included clinical applications of lexicographic coverage, semantic similarity, clustering purity, linguistic regularity, and mortality prediction.

**Results:** The embeddings trained using the published case reports performed as well as if not better on most tasks than those using other corpora. The embeddings trained using all published manuscripts had the most consistent performance across all tasks and required a corpus with 100 times as many tokens as the corpus comprised of only case reports. Embeddings trained on the MIMIC-III dataset had small but marginally better scores on the clustering tasks which was also based on clinical notes from the MIMIC-III dataset. Embeddings trained on the Wikipedia corpus, although containing almost twice as many tokens as all available published manuscripts, performed poorly compared to those trained on medical and clinical corpora. 

**Conclusion:** Word embeddings trained on freely available published case reports performed well for most clinical task, are free of protected health information, and are small compared to commonly used embeddings trained on larger clinical and non-clinical corpora. The optimal corpus, dimension size, and which embedding model to use for a given task involves tradeoffs in privacy, reproducibility, performance, and computational resources.","/content/10.1101/19013268v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013268v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04",NA,"Flamholz","/highwire/citation/70475/bibtext",11,"051219-11","05/12/2019","70475"
"Left frontal white matter atrophy links to timing mechanisms relevant for apraxia of speech","Objective:
In some patients with apraxia of speech (AOS), we observed impaired perceptual timing abilities, which lead us to propose a shared mechanism of impaired perceptual timing underlying impaired rhythm discrimination (perceptual processing) and AOS (motor speech output). Given that considerable white matter damage is often observed in these patients, we here investigate whether white matter changes are related to impaired rhythm processing as one possible mechanism underlying AOS. 
Methods:
We applied deformation-based morphometry (DBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 12 patients with the nonfluent variant (NFV) of Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) with AOS, as well as 11 patients with the semantic variant and 24 controls. 
Results:
Seventy-five percent of the patients with NFV displayed impaired rhythm processing and the severity of their impairment correlated with their degree of AOS. Moreover, left frontal white matter volume loss adjacent to the supplementary motor area (SMA) correlated with impaired rhythm processing. In addition, we obtained tract-based metrics of the left Aslant tract, which is typically damaged in NFV. The structural integrity of the left Aslant tract also correlated with rhythmic discrimination abilities in NFV. 
Conclusions:
Our data suggest that a shared white matter substrate adjacent to the SMA contributes to impaired rhythm perception and motor speech impairments. This indicates that impaired perceptual timing may be one of the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying AOS. Our observation that regional variations in left frontal lobe atrophy are linked to the phenotypical heterogeneity in NFV may lead the way for earlier diagnosis.","/content/10.1101/19013458v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013458v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04","Neurology

"Evaluation of Prognostic Utility of Tumor Mutation Burden for Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy: A Single Institute Study","IMPORTANCE: The role of Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) as a prognostic and/or predictive biomarker for Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) therapy in a real-world clinical setting is still unclear. 
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether TMB status provided by a clinically and commercially available tumor genomic profiling (TGP) assay is associated with overall survival of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with ICB from a single institute.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Outcomes and genetic testing data were collected for 188 NSCLC patients treated within the Cleveland Clinic system between August 2012 and July 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival (OS) from time receiving ICB therapy.
RESULTS: Among 188 patients with NSCLC (median age, 62 years; 49.5% female), 86 (45.7%) received ICB therapy. Patients were grouped into three categories based on the status of TMB (in mutations/Mb): high (>= 20/Mb), intermediate (>=5 to <= 20/Mb), and low (<5/Mb). In patients treated with ICB, TMB high status was not significantly associated with improved OS from therapy initiation (HR: 0.90 [95% CI, 0.52-2.49, P>0.8], median OS difference: 9.7 months).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with NSCLC from a single institute with a longitudinal database of clinical data including TGP results, exploratory analyses do not show statistical significance for the prognostic utility of TMB. These findings indicate that there is a need for more prospective data on the use of TMB status as a guide for ICB therapy in a routine care setting.","/content/10.1101/19013433v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013433v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04","Oncology

"Using a genetic risk score to estimate the earliest age of Alzheimer's disease-related physiologic change in Body Mass Index","Abstract
Objectives:  Weight loss is common in the years before an Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, likely due to changes in appetite and diet. The age at which this change in body mass index (BMI) emerges is unclear but may point to the earliest manifestations of AD, timing that may be important for identifying windows of intervention or risk reduction. We examined the association between AD genetic risk and cross-sectional BMI across adults in mid- to late-life as an innovative approach to determine the age at which BMI changes and may indicate preclinical AD. 
Design: Observational study
Setting: UK Biobank
Participants: 407,386 UK Biobank non-demented participants aged 39-70 with Caucasian genetic ancestry enrolled 2007-2010. 
Main Outcome Measures: BMI (kg/m2) was constructed from height and weight measured during the initial visit. A genetic risk score for AD (AD-GRS) was calculated as a weighted sum of 23 genetic variants previously confirmed to be genome-wide significant predictors of AD (Z-scored). We evaluated whether the association of AD-GRS with BMI differed by age using linear regression with adjustment for sex and genetic ancestry, stratified by age grouping (40-60, 61+). We calculated the earliest age at which high AD-GRS predicted divergence in BMI compared to normal age-related BMI trends with linear and quadratic terms for age and interactions with AD-GRS. 
Results: In 39-49 year olds, AD-GRS was not significantly associated with lower BMI (0.00 kg/m2 per SD in AD-GRS; 95%CI: -0.03,0.03). In 50-59 year olds AD-GRS was associated with lower BMI (-0.03 kg/m2 per 1 SD in AD-GRS; 95%CI:-0.06,-0.01) and this association was stronger in 60-70 year olds (-0.09 kg/m2 per 1 SD in AD-GRS; 95%CI:-0.12,-0.07). Model-based BMI age-curves for people with high versus low AD-GRS scores began to diverge after age 47.  
Interpretation: Genetic factors that increase AD risk begin to predict lower BMI in adults by age 50, with greater effect later in older ages. Weight loss may manifest as an early pathophysiologic change associated with AD.","/content/10.1101/19013441v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013441v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04","Epidemiology

"Impact of a city-wide school-located influenza vaccination program over four years on vaccination coverage, school absences, and laboratory-confirmed influenza: a prospective matched cohort study","Background: It is estimated that vaccinating 50-70% of school-aged children for influenza can produce population-wide indirect effects. We evaluated a city-wide, school-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) intervention that aimed to increase influenza vaccination coverage. The intervention was implemented in over 95 pre-schools and elementary schools in northern California from 2014 to 2018. Using a matched prospective cohort design, we estimated intervention impacts on student influenza vaccination coverage, school absenteeism, and community-wide indirect effects on laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations. 
Methods and Findings: We used a multivariate matching algorithm to identify a nearby comparison school district with similar pre-intervention characteristics and matched schools in each district. To measure student influenza vaccination, we conducted cross-sectional surveys of student caregivers in 22 school pairs (2016 survey N = 6,070; 2017 survey N = 6,507). We estimated the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization from 2011-2018 using surveillance data from school district zip codes. We analyzed student absenteeism data from 2011-2018 from each district (N = 42,487,816 student-days). To account for pre-intervention differences between districts, we estimated difference-in-differences (DID) in influenza hospitalization incidence and absenteeism rates using generalized linear and log-linear models with a population offset for incidence outcomes. 
The number of students vaccinated by the SLIV intervention ranged from 7,502 to 10,106 (22-28% of eligible students) each year. During the intervention, influenza vaccination coverage among elementary students was 53-66% in the comparison district. Coverage was similar between the intervention and comparison districts in 2014-15 and 2015-16 and was significantly higher in the intervention site in 2016-17 (7% 95% CI 4, 11) and 2017-18 (11% 95% CI 7, 15). During seasons when vaccination coverage was higher among intervention schools and the vaccine was moderately effective, there was evidence of statistically significant indirect effects: adjusting for pre-intervention differences between districts, the reduction in influenza hospitalizations in the intervention site was 76 (95% CI 20, 133) in 2016-17 and 165 (95% CI 86, 243) in 2017-18 among non-elementary school aged individuals and 327 (5, 659) in 2016-17 and 715 (236, 1195) in 2017-18 among adults 65 years or older. The reduction in illness-related school absences during influenza season was 3,538 (95% CI 709, 6,366) in 2016-17 and 8,249 (95% CI 3,213, 13,285) in 2017-18. Limitations of this study include the use of an observational design, which may be subject to unmeasured confounding, and caregiver-reported vaccination status, which is subject to poor recall and low response rates. 
Conclusion: A city-wide SLIV intervention in a large, diverse urban population decreased the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization in all age groups and decreased illness-specific school absence rates among students during seasons when the vaccine was moderately effective, suggesting that the intervention produced indirect effects. Our findings suggest that in populations with moderately high background levels of influenza vaccination coverage, SLIV programs can further increase coverage and reduce influenza across communities.","/content/10.1101/19013151v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013151v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Vitamin D status in chronic tic-disorder and comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A pan-European study","Background: Hypovitaminosis-D has been linked to neuropsychiatric conditions, but little is known about vitamin D status in individuals with chronic tic disorders (CTD). This study sought to determine whether vitamin D levels are associated with the severity of tics and presence and severity of comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Methods: This is a cross-sectional sub-study of the European Multicentre Tics in Children Studies (EMTICS). Vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels (ng/ml) were obtained for 327 participants with CTD at study entry and tic severity was measured using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). An association between tic severity and presence and severity of comorbid OCD and/or ADHD symptoms was analysed using multilevel models controlling for season, site, sex, age and presence of comorbid OCD and/or ADHD.
Results: The participants comprised 247 boys and 80 girls (4-16 years, mean [SD], 10.9 [2.72]). Hypovitaminosis-D ([25(OH)D] < 20ng/ml) was present in 33% of participants with CTD and/ or comorbid OCD and/ or ADHD. The authors found no association between 25(OH)D levels and tic severity or OCD symptom severity. However, lower 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with increased severity of ADHD symptoms in participants with CTD ( = -0.25, s.e. = 0.08, 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.09; p < 0.01). 
Conclusion: Additional research is needed to confirm these findings and assess whether hypovitaminosis-D may represent an underlying biological vulnerability for comorbid ADHD symptoms in CTD as it may signpost novel strategies for prevention and treatment.","/content/10.1101/19012062v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012062v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Anxiolytic effects of a galacto-oligosaccharides prebiotic in healthy female volunteers are associated with reduced negative bias and the gut bacterial composition.","Current research implicates pre- and probiotic supplementation as potential mediators for improving symptomology in numerous physical and emotional ailments. The alteration of emotional states via nutrient intake is an attractive concept for clinicians and consumers alike and may be an efficient channel to improved well-being. Here we focus on the period of late adolescence, which is a time of emotional refinement via maturation that significantly influences emotional, social and physical well-being in later years. Effective interventions such as nutritional supplementation in this age group have the potential to offset health-related costs in later life. In this study we examined multiple indices of mood and well-being in 64 healthy females in late adolescence in a 4-week double blind, placebo controlled Galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) prebiotic supplement intervention. We also obtained stool samples at baseline and follow-up for microbiome sequencing and analyses. We found effects of the GOS intervention on sub-clinical self-reported high trait anxiety, attentional bias, and bacterial abundance, suggesting that dietary supplementation with a GOS prebiotic may be influential in improving indices of pre-clinical anxiety.","/content/10.1101/19011403v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011403v1.full.pdf","2019-12-04","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Redefining multiple sclerosis phenotypes using MRI","Background:
There are 4 courses of multiple sclerosis (MS): clinically-isolated syndrome (CIS),  relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary-progressive MS (PPMS)  and  secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). We aimed to achieve a further sophistication in the definition of MS phenotypes by identifying patient subgroups who accumulate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities with similar patterns. We assessed whether data-driven subtyping predicted clinical outcome and response to experimental treatments.
Methods:
In this retrospective study, we included longitudinal data from 8,545 people with MS who had 31,451 visits from 14 double-blind randomised controlled trials and three observational cohorts. We included cross-sectional data from 14,928 healthy volunteers. For each visit, we processed brain MRI scans. We obtained 18 MRI variables, includ that included the volume of the cortex of each lobe and deep grey matter, cerebellar grey matter and wite matter, total lesion volume, cerebral white matter, brainstem, and T1/T2 ratio in regions of the normal appearing white matter (or NAWM). We trained a machine learning algorithm, called SuStaIn, on 14 datasets to identify data-driven subtypes. We then tested it in three external, independent datasets.we assessed the external validity of our model by testing if we could predict 24-week confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression, disease activity, and the reduction in EDSS worsening in each subtype on treatment vs placebo. To investigate whether there was a difference in the treatment response between the SuStaIn subtypes we used linear mixed effect modles
Findings:
We identified three data-driven subtypes with a distinct neuroanatomical spread of abnormality and termed subtypes according to areas they affected early in disease course: cortex-first (44% of patients), NAWM-first (30%), and the lesion-first (26%). Data-driven subtyping and staging, but not clinical classifications or EDSS at baseline, was associated with time to EDSS progression (Subtype=0.04 and stage=-0.06, p<0.01 for all). In external datasets, compared to the cortex-first, the lesion-first subtype had a shorter time to EDSS progression (hazard ratios range=1.75 to 1.82 across trials, p<0.01) and higher disease activity (p<0.05 for relapse rate and gad-enhancing lesions). In three progressive MS trials the lesion-first subtype showed the greatest treatment response (64% more than the cortex-first, p<0.001).
Interpretation: 
Data-driven MS subtypes and stages, when compared with clinical classification or baseline EDSS better predicts the subsequent clinical course and treatment response. Data-driven subtyping has the potential to prospectively enrich clinical trials with patients who are more likely to respond to treatments.

"Dysmetabolic circulating tumor cells are prognostic in Metastatic Breast Cancer","The prognostic value of the circulating tumor cells (CTCs), defined as EpCAM+, Cytokeratin (8, 18, 19)+ and CD45- nucleated cells, has been provided in metastatic breast cancer (mBC), with Level I of evidence. However, CTCs belong to a heterogeneous pool of rare cells, and there is not consensus on an univocal definition of CTCs. Here, we present a definition of metabolically altered CTCs (MBA-CTC) as CD45-negative cells with an increased extracellular acidification rate (iECAR), supported by the presence of iECAR among the hallmarks of cancer. We tested the prognostic value of MBA-CTC present in mBC patients before starting a new systemic therapy (T0) and 3-4 weeks after (T1). Samples were analyzed in parallel with CellSearch platform (CS). Standard RECIST criteria were used to determine patients' responses to treatment. 
In our cohort of n=31 mBC patients, a level of MBA-CTCs above the cut-off was associated with: i) a shorter median PFS both pre-therapy (123 days vs 306; p<0.0001) and during therapy (139 vs 266 days; p= 0.0009); ii) a worse OS both pre-therapy (p=0.0003, 82% survival vs 20%) and during therapy (p=0.0301, 67% survival vs 38%); iii) good agreement with therapy response (kappa=0.685). Both the trend of MBA-CTCs over time and the combined results of the two assays (MBA and CS) enabled more accurate stratification. MBA and CS results showed fair (K=0.33) and poor (K=0.077) agreement at T0 and T1, respectively. This fact and the increased accuracy in combining results suggest that the assays detect different CTC subsets. In conclusion, MBA-CTCs does provide prognostic information at least equivalent to CS, and are even more informative when analyzed over time or combined with CS-CTCs.","/content/10.1101/19012211v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012211v2.full.pdf","2019-12-02","Oncology

"Characteristics, service use and mortality of clusters of multimorbid patients in England: a population-based study","Background
Multimorbidity is one of the principal challenges facing health systems worldwide. To help understand the changes to services and policies that are required to deliver better care, we used a novel approach to investigate which diseases co-occur and how combinations are associated with mortality and service use.
 
Methods
Linked primary and secondary care electronic health records contributed by 382 general practices in England to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) were used. The study included a representative set of multimorbid adults (18 years old or more) with two or more long-term conditions (N=113,211). A random set of 80% of the multimorbid patients (N=90,571) were stratified by age and clustered using latent class analysis. Consistency between obtained disease profiles, classification quality and associations with demographic characteristics and primary outcomes (hospitalisation, polypharmacy and mortality) was validated in the remaining 20% of multimorbid patients (N=22,640). 

Findings
We identified twenty patient clusters across four age strata. The clusters with the highest mortality comprised psychoactive substance and alcohol misuse (aged 18-64), coronary heart disease, depression and pain (aged 65-84) and coronary heart disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation (aged 85+). The clusters with the highest service use coincided with those with highest mortality for people aged over 65.  For people aged 18-64, the cluster with the highest service use comprised depression, anxiety and pain. The majority of 85+ year olds multimorbid patients belonged to the cluster with the lowest service use and mortality for that age range. Pain featured in thirteen clusters.  
Interpretation
This work has highlighted patterns of multimorbidity that have implications for health services. These include the importance of psychoactive substance and alcohol misuse in people under the age of 65; of co-morbid depression and coronary heart disease in people aged 65-84, and of cardiovascular disease in people aged 85+.","/content/10.1101/19000422v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000422v2.full.pdf","2019-12-02","Epidemiology

"Can we predict early 7-day readmissions using a standard 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction model?","Despite focus on preventing 30-day readmissions, early readmissions (within 7 days of discharge) may be more preventable than later readmissions (8-30 days). We assessed how well a previously validated 30-day readmission prediction model predicts 7-day readmissions. We re-derived model coefficients for the same predictors as in the original 30-day model to optimize prediction of 7-day readmissions. We compared model performance and compared differences in strength of model factors between the 7-day model to the 30-day model. While there was no substantial change in model performance between the original 30-day and the re-derived 7-day model, there was significant change in strength of predictors. Characteristics at discharge were more predictive of 7-day readmissions, while baseline characteristics were less predictive. Improvements in predicting early 7-day readmissions will likely require new risk factors proximal to the day of discharge.","/content/10.1101/19012468v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012468v2.full.pdf","2019-12-02","Health Systems and Quality Improvement

"Violin plot data: A concerto of crucial information on valve thrombogenicity categorized in vitro by valve motion and inferred flow velocity","Abstract:
Objectives 
This in vitro study compares mechanical (MHV) and bioprosthetic (BHV) heart valves for high amplitude short duration regional flow velocities (RFV) near valve closure.
Background 
We previously tested several clinical and prototype valves and observed RFV at levels which may be related to a dimensionless thrombogenic potential (TP).  
Methods 
A total of four valves were tested in aortic and mitral sites under pulsatile circulation in a pulse duplicator. Valves included both clinical models and experimental prototypes. An optical approach measuring projected dynamic valve area (PDVA) to gauge valve motion was implemented. Pulsatile pressures and flow rates were measured by conventional techniques and a quasi-steady flow tester was used to measure valve leakage. RFV was derived using time-dependent volumetric flow rate/PDVA. Since flow velocity and fluid shear force are related through flow velocity gradient, TPs for valves that achieve near closure during the forward flow deceleration phase were determined as RFVs relative to the control mechanical valve RFV value of -126 m/s.  
Results
TP is dimensionless and ranged between -0.45 and +1.0. Negative TPs arise when transient rebound of valve occluders is accompanied by water-hammer phenomena. Positive TPs occur during the decelerating forward flow. Bioprostheses had lowest TP transient of 0.15 with exception of a mock-transcatheter aortic valve (mTAVI) that incorporated by design a trivial perivalvular leak (~1.35 ml/s). This device demonstrated a remarkably high transient TP of 0.95. The control mechanical valves had the highest TP of 1.0. The study implicates TP transients near mechanical valve closure, and not forward or non-flow phases, as primary to shear induced activation of the coagulation cascade.
Conclusions
Our data reveals distinct TP profile differences between valve models. If verifiable, the design of future valves may utilize currently available experimental tools to determine TPs resulting in advanced devices with significantly reduced TP.","/content/10.1101/19009407v4?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009407v4.full.pdf","2019-12-02","Cardiovascular Medicine

"IE-Map: A novel in-vivo atlas template of the human inner ear","Brain atlases and templates are core tools in scientific research with increasing importance also in clinical applications. Advances in neuroimaging  now allowed us to expand the atlas domain to the vestibular and auditory organ, the inner ear. In this study, we present IE-Map, an in-vivo template and atlas of all known substructures of the human labyrinth derived from multi-modal high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging data in a non-invasive manner (no contrast agent or radiation). We reconstructed a common template from 126 inner ears (63 normal subjects)  and annotated it with 94 established landmarks and semi-automatic segmentations. Quantitative substructure analysis revealed a correlation of labyrinth parameters with total intracranial volume. No effects of gender or laterality were found. We provide the validated templates, atlas segmentations, surface meshes and landmark annotations as open-access material, to provide neuroscience researchers and clinicians in neurology, neurosurgery, and otorhinolaryngology with a widely applicable tool for computational neuro-otology.","/content/10.1101/19011908v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011908v2.full.pdf","2019-12-05","Radiology and Imaging

"Measuring Tibial Forces is More Useful than Varus-Valgus Laxities for Identifying and Correcting Overstuffing in Kinematically Aligned Total Knee Arthroplasty","Identifying and correcting varus-valgus (V-V) malalignment of the tibial component is important when balancing a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Accordingly, the primary objective was to determine whether the tibial forces or V-V laxities are more sensitive to, and thus more useful for identifying and correcting, V-V malalignments of the tibial component that overstuff a compartment. Calipered kinematically aligned TKA was performed on nine human cadaveric knees. Medial and lateral tibial forces and V-V laxities were measured from 0 to 120 flexion with an unmodified reference tibial component and modified tibial components that introduced 1 and 2 V-V malalignments from the reference component to overstuff either the medial or lateral compartment. Changes in the tibial forces were most sensitive to V-V malalignments at 0 flexion (medial = 11834 N/deg valgus malalignment and lateral = 7920 N/deg varus malalignment). The varus and valgus laxities were most sensitive to V-V malalignments at 30 flexion (-0.60.1 deg/deg varus malalignment) and 120 flexion (-0.40.2 deg/deg valgus malalignment), respectively. The maximum average signal-to-noise ratios of the sensitivities to changes in tibial forces and V-V laxities were 8.4 deg-1 and 0.9 deg-1, respectively, based on reported measurement errors (i.e., noise) using current intraoperative technologies (14 N and 0.7). Because of the greater signal-to-noise ratios, measuring tibial forces is more useful than V-V laxities for identifying and correcting V-V malalignments of the tibial component that overstuff a compartment. Clinical Significance: The sensitivities of tibial forces provide objective guidance to surgeons performing V-V recuts of the tibia.","/content/10.1101/19013755v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013755v1.full.pdf","2019-12-05","Orthopedics

"How do interventions impact malaria dynamics between neighboring countries? A case study with Botswana and Zimbabwe","Malaria is a vector-borne disease that is responsible for over 400,000 deaths per year. Although countries around the world have taken measures to decrease the incidence of malaria, many regions remain endemic. Indeed, progress towards elimination has stalled in multiple countries. While control efforts are largely focused at the national level, the movement of individuals between countries may complicate the efficacy of elimination efforts. Here, we consider the case of neighboring countries Botswana and Zimbabwe, connected by human mobility. Both have improved malaria rates in recent years with differing success. We use a two-patch Ross-MacDonald Model with Lagrangian human mobility to examine the coupled disease dynamics between these two countries. In particular, we are interested in the impact that interventions for controlling malaria applied in one country can have on the incidence of malaria in the other country. We find that dynamics and interventions in Zimbabwe can dramatically influence pathways to elimination in Botswana, largely driven by Zimbabwe's population size and larger basic reproduction number.","/content/10.1101/19013631v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013631v2.full.pdf","2019-12-05","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"MAKING DENSENET INTERPRETABLE A CASE STUDY IN CLINICAL RADIOLOGY","The monotonous routine of medical image analysis under tight time constraints has always led to work fatigue for many medical practitioners. Medical image interpretation can be error-prone and this can increase the risk of an incorrect procedure being recommended. While the advancement of complex deep learning models has achieved performance beyond human capability in some computer vision tasks, widespread adoption in the medical field has been held back, among other factors, by poor model interpretability and a lack of high-quality labelled data. This paper introduces a model interpretation and visualisation framework for the analysis of the feature extraction process of a deep convolutional neural network and applies it to abnormality detection using the musculoskeletal radiograph dataset (MURA, Stanford). The proposed framework provides a mechanism for interpreting DenseNet deep learning architectures. It aims to provide a deeper insight about the paths of feature generation and reasoning within a DenseNet architecture. When evaluated on MURA at abnormality detection tasks, the model interpretation framework has been shown capable of identifying limitations in the reasoning of a DenseNet architecture applied to radiography, which can in turn be ameliorated through model interpretation and visualization.","/content/10.1101/19013730v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013730v1.full.pdf","2019-12-05","Radiology and Imaging

"Knowledge Driven Phenotyping","Extracting patient phenotypes from routinely collected health data (such as Electronic Health Records) requires translating clinically-sound phenotype definitions into queries/computations executable on the underlying data sources by clinical researchers. This requires significant knowledge and skills to deal with heterogeneous and often imperfect data. Translations are time-consuming, error-prone and, most importantly, hard to share and reproduce across different settings. This paper proposes a knowledge driven framework that (1) decouples the specification of phenotype semantics from underlying data sources; (2) can automatically populate and conduct phenotype computations on heterogeneous data spaces. We report preliminary results of deploying this framework on five Scottish health datasets.","/content/10.1101/19013748v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013748v1.full.pdf","2019-12-06","Health Informatics

"Utilization of Family Planning and Associated Factors among Reproductive Age Women with Disability in Arba Minch , Southern Ethiopia","Introduction globally, one type of contraceptive was used by around 63 percent of women. Women with disabilities account for 10 percent of all women and make up three-quarters of the disabled people in low and middle-income countries. 
Objective to assess utilization of family planning and associated factors among reproductive-age women with disability group in Arba Minch town, southern Ethiopia from 1st March to April 15, 2019.  
Methods community-based cross-sectional study with simple random sampling was used to select 4l8 reproductive age women with disabilities. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and interview by eight trained females who completed grade twelve two of which communicate by speaking and sign language. Data were entered using Epi info 7 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. A statically significant variable in the final model was declared by AOR, 95%CI and p-value 	<0.05. 
Result in the current study family planning utilization among all reproductive-age women with disabilities was 33.7%. Family planning utilization was 2.2 times higher among those who have employed compared with those with not employed (AOR2.2 95% CI, 1.77- 4.15). Women who had a positive attitude were 2.3 times more likely to use family planning than negative attitudes (AOR 2.3:95% CI, 1.21- 3.87). Besides these women who got married were almost four times more likely to use family planning methods than unmarried (AOR 3.9:95% CI, 2.31-6.63).
Conclusion The level of family planning utilization was low among reproductive women with disabilities and factors associated were attitude, marital status, & employed status, therefore governmental and non-governmental organization should promote for women with disabilities to change the attitude and creating job opportunities.","/content/10.1101/19013821v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013821v1.full.pdf","2019-12-06","Sexual and Reproductive Health

"Interactive Psychometrics for Autism with the Human Dynamic Clamp: Interpersonal Synchrony from Sensory-motor to Socio-cognitive Domains","Background: The Human Dynamic Clamp (HDC) is a human-machine interface for studying realistic social interaction under controlled and reproducible conditions. Here, we propose to probe the validity of the HDC as psychometric instrument for quantifying social abilities in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASDs) and neurotypical development. Methods: To study behavioral synchrony, we derived from interaction with the HDC avatar, five standardized scores following a gradient from sensory-motor and motor to higher socio-cognitive skills, in a sample of 155 individuals (113 with ASDs, 42 typically developing participants; aged 5 to 25 years; IQ>70). Results: We conducted regression analyses with normative modeling on global scores according to four sub-conditions (avatar behavior ""cooperative/competitive"", human task ""in-phase/anti-phase"", diagnosis and age at inclusion). Children with ASDs tend to have significant lower scores than controls for motor skills. Independently of the phenotype, socio-cognitive skills increase with developmental age, while being affected by the ongoing task and the behavior of the avatar. Discussion: The weaker performance in participants with ASDs for motor skills suggests convergent validity for this score of the HDC during social interaction. Results provide additional evidence of a relationship between sensory-motor and socio-cognitive skills. As we found a significant main effect of age at inclusion, HDC may be used as a marker of aging of socio-cognitive skills during real-time social interaction. Conclusion: Through its standardized and objective evaluation, the HDC not only represents a valid paradigm for the study of interpersonal synchrony but also a clinically relevant psychometric instrument for the evaluation and stratification of socio-motor dysfunctions.","/content/10.1101/19013771v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013771v1.full.pdf","2019-12-06","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Local authority variation in uptake of the HPV vaccine in Greater Manchester and school-level factors: a cross-sectional ecological study","Background:
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer and contributes to a number of other cancers that affect both men and women. Vaccines exist that offer protection against the most common cancer-causing HPV types. In England, a school-based vaccination programme for girls has been in place since 2008 but vaccine coverage rates have declined since its introduction. Understanding variation between schools and between local authorities may help to inform quality improvement and guide policy development and commissioning.

Methods:
Cross-sectional, ecological analysis of vaccine uptake among 164 schools representing 13,127 children in eight out of ten local authorities in Greater Manchester. Logistic mixed effects regression models were used to test for associations between school level factors and vaccine uptake, while allowing for variation between local authorities.

Results:
In multivariable mixed effects models, lower vaccination rates were associated with: increasing numbers of children eligible for vaccination; increasing proportions of children eligible for free school meals; increasing proportions of children with English as an additional language; Ofsted inadequate ratings; Christian and Muslim faith schools; independent schools and special schools.

Conclusions:
Consistent with previous studies on vaccine uptake, this study identifies a number of factors that are associated with uptake of the school-based HPV vaccine programme. We also show that local authority variation remains after adjustment for the mix of schools in each area. This evidence may be used to guide vaccine providers, commissioners, and policymakers who want to increase uptake of the school-based HPV vaccine.","/content/10.1101/19013839v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013839v1.full.pdf","2019-12-06","Public and Global Health

"Self-selected step length asymmetry is not explained by energy cost minimization in individuals with chronic stroke.","Background: Asymmetric gait post-stroke is associated with decreased mobility, yet individuals with chronic stroke often self-select an asymmetric gait despite being capable of walking more symmetrically. The purpose of this study was to test whether self-selected asymmetry could be explained by energy cost minimization. We hypothesized that short-term deviations from self-selected asymmetry would result in increased metabolic energy consumption, despite being associated with long-term rehabilitation benefits. Other studies have found no difference in metabolic rate across different levels of enforced asymmetry among individuals with chronic stroke, but used methods that left some uncertainty to be resolved. 
Methods: In this study, ten individuals with chronic stroke walked on a treadmill at participant-specific speeds while voluntarily modulating step length asymmetry. We included only participants with significant self-selected asymmetry who were able to significantly alter asymmetry using visual biofeedback. Conditions included targeting zero asymmetry, self-selected asymmetry, and double the self-selected asymmetry. Participants were trained with the biofeedback system in one session, and data were collected in three subsequent sessions with repeated measures. Self-selected asymmetry was consistent across sessions. A similar protocol was conducted among unimpaired participants.
Results: Participants with chronic stroke substantially altered step length asymmetry using biofeedback, but this did not affect metabolic rate (ANOVA, p = 0.8). In unimpaired participants, self-selected step length asymmetry was close to zero and corresponded to the lowest energy cost (ANOVA, p = 6e-4). While the symmetry of unimpaired gait may be the result of energy cost minimization, self-selected step length asymmetry in individuals with chronic stroke cannot be explained by a similar least-effort drive. 
Conclusions: Interventions that encourage changes in step length asymmetry by manipulating metabolic energy consumption may be effective because these therapies would not have to overcome a metabolic penalty for altering asymmetry.","/content/10.1101/19013854v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013854v1.full.pdf","2019-12-06","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Prevention of bone loss and fractures following solid organ transplantations: Protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis","Purpose
Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients can develop skeletal diseases caused by underlying conditions and the use of immunosuppressants. As a result, SOT recipients are at risk for decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture incidences. We propose a network meta-analysis (NMA) that incorporates all available RCT data to provide the most comprehensive ranking of antiresorptive interventions according to their ability to decrease fracture incidences and increase BMD in SOT recipients.   

Methods
We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Chinese literature sources for RCTs, and we will include adult SOT recipients who took antiresorptive therapies starting at the time of transplant with relevant outcomes. We will perform title and full-text screening as well as data extraction in duplicate. We will report changes in BMD as weighted or standardized mean differences, and fracture incidences as risk ratios. We will use SUCRA scores to provide rankings of interventions, and we will examine the quality of evidence using risk of bias and CINeMA. 

Results
The results of this systematic review and network meta-analysis will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Conclusions
To our knowledge, this systematic review and network meta-analysis will be the most comprehensive quantitative analysis regarding the management of bone loss and fractures in SOT recipients. Our analysis should be able to provide physicians and patients with an up-to-date recommendation for pharmacotherapies in reducing incidences of bone loss and fractures associated with SOT.","/content/10.1101/19013797v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013797v1.full.pdf","2019-12-06","Transplantation

"Host genomics of the HIV-1 reservoir size and its decay rate during suppressive antiretroviral treatment","Introduction 
A major hurdle to HIV-1 eradication is the establishment of a latent viral reservoir early after primary infection. Several factors are known to influence the HIV-1 reservoir size and decay rate on suppressive antiretroviral treatment (ART), but little is known about the role of human genetic variation.
Methods
We measured the reservoir size at three time points over a median of 5.4 years, and searched for associations between human genetic variation and two phenotypic readouts: the reservoir size at the first time point and its decay rate over the study period. We assessed the contribution of common genetic variants using genome-wide genotyping data from 797 patients with European ancestry enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and searched for a potential impact of rare variants and exonic copy number variants using exome sequencing data generated in a subset of 194 study participants. 
Results
Genome- and exome-wide analyses did not reveal any significant association with the size of the HIV-1 reservoir or its decay rate on suppressive ART. 
Conclusions 
Our results point to a limited influence of human genetics on the size of the HIV-1 reservoir and its long-term dynamics in successfully treated individuals.","/content/10.1101/19013763v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013763v1.full.pdf","2019-12-06","HIV/AIDS

"PheWAS-ME: A web-app for interactive exploration of multimorbidity patterns in PheWAS","Summary: Electronic health records (EHRs) linked with a DNA biobank provide unprecedented opportunities to use big data for biomedical research in precision medicine. The Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) is a widely used technique for high-throughput evaluation of relationships between a set of genetic variants and a large collection of clinical phenotypes recorded in EHRs. PheWAS analyses are typically presented as static tables and charts of summary statistics obtained from statistical tests of association between pairs of a genetic variant and individual phenotypes. Comorbidities are common and typically lead to complex, multivariate gene-disease association signals that are challenging to interpret. Discovering and interrogating multimorbidity patterns and their influence in PheWAS is difficult and time- consuming. Here, we present a web application to visualize individual-level genotype and phenotype data side-by-side with PheWAS analysis results in an interactive dashboard, allowing researchers to explore multimorbidity patterns and their associations with a genetic variant of interest. We expect this application to enrich PheWAS analyses by illuminating clinical multimorbidity patterns present in the data.","/content/10.1101/19009480v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009480v3.full.pdf","2019-12-09","Health Informatics

"Personalized Connectome Mapping to Guide Targeted Therapy and Promote Recovery of Consciousness in the Intensive Care Unit","There are currently no therapies proven to promote early recovery of consciousness in patients with severe brain injuries in the intensive care unit (ICU). Early recovery of consciousness would benefit patients and families by reducing the likelihood of premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and may decrease ICU complications related to immobility, facilitate self-expression, enable autonomous decision-making, and increase access to rehabilitative care. Here, we present the connectome-based clinical trial platform (CCTP), a new mechanistic paradigm for developing and testing targeted therapies that promote early recovery of consciousness in the ICU. The scientific premise of the CCTP is that personalized brain connectome maps can be used to select patients for targeted therapies that promote recovery of consciousness. Structural and functional MRI connectome maps will identify circuits that may be amenable to neuromodulation. Patients will be selected for clinical trials in the CCTP paradigm based on connectomes that are likely to respond to targeted therapies. To demonstrate the utility of this precision approach, we describe STIMPACT (Stimulant Therapy Targeted to Individualized Connectivity Maps to Promote ReACTivation of Consciousness), a CCTP-based clinical trial in which intravenous methylphenidate will be used to promote early recovery of consciousness in the ICU (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03814356). We propose that the CCTP has the potential to transform the therapeutic landscape in the ICU and improve outcomes for patients with severe brain injuries.","/content/10.1101/19013987v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013987v1.full.pdf","2019-12-09","Neurology

"Using Paired Agent-Based Simulations To Test Strategies For Limiting The Effects Of Epidemics","Agent-based simulations are widely used nowadays in public health research for comparing different  strategies for mitigating epidemics and for planning appropriate responses in the aftermath of crises in large urban areas because they can capture fine scale heterogeneities that may have important non-linear effects on the results. Given the costs of implementing strategies, decision-makers have to be convinced that the proposed treatment/procedure leads to a statistically significant improvement.

This paper presents an innovative method for constructing paired agent-based simulations where exactly the same set of random effects is applied to simulations with and without the treatment/procedure. Statistical Analysis of Variance distinguishes the sum of squares between groups (BSS) from the sum of squares within groups (WSS). Our aim was to filter out the within sum of squares (WSS) leaving only the sum of squares between the control group and the treatment group (BSS).  We propose to filter out the WSS by constructing paired simulations because as is well known, when paired t-tests can be used, they are much more powerful than ordinary t-tests. Pearson's Chi-squared goodness of fit, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and the Kullback-Leibler Divergence are then used to test whether the effect is statistically significant. This procedure has been tested on a case-study on the propagation of the Zika epidemic in Rio de Janeiro in 2015.","/content/10.1101/19014043v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19014043v1.full.pdf","2019-12-09","Epidemiology

"Exploring barriers and facilitators to integrated hypertension-HIV management in Ugandan HIV clinics using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)","Background: Persons Living with HIV (PLHIV) receiving antiretroviral therapy have increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Integration of services for hypertension (HTN), the primary CVD risk factor, into HIV clinics is recommended in Uganda. Our prior work demonstrated multiple gaps in implementation of integrated HTN care along the HIV treatment cascade. In this study, we sought to explore barriers to, and facilitators of, integrating HTN screening and treatment into HIV clinics in Eastern Uganda.

Methods: We conducted a qualitative study at three HIV clinics with low, intermediate, and high HTN care cascade performance, which we classified based on our prior work. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we conducted semi-structured interviews with health services managers, health care providers and hypertensive PLHIV (n=83). Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Three qualitative researchers used both deductive (CFIR model-driven) and inductive (open coding) methods to develop relevant codes and themes. Ratings were performed to determine valence and strengths of each CFIR construct regarding influencing HTN/HIV integration. 

Results: Of the 39 CFIR constructs assessed, 17 were relevant to either barriers or facilitators to HTN/HIV integration. Six constructs strongly distinguished performance and were barriers, three of which were in the Inner setting (Organizational Incentives & Rewards, Available Resources, Access to Knowledge & Information); two in Characteristics of individuals (Knowledge & Beliefs about the Intervention and Self-efficacy) and one in Intervention characteristics (Design Quality & Packaging). Four additional constructs were weakly distinguishing and negatively influenced HTN/HIV integration. There were four facilitators for HTN/HIV integration related to the intervention (Relative advantage, Adaptability, Complexity and Compatibility). The remaining four constructs negatively influenced HTN/HIV integration but were non-distinguishing. 

Conclusion: Using the CFIR, we have shown that while there are modifiable barriers to HTN/HIV integration in the Inner setting, Outer setting, Characteristics of individuals and implementation Process, HTN/HIV integration is of interest to patients, health care providers and managers. Improving access to HTN care among PLHIV will require overcoming barriers and capitalizing on the facilitators using a health system strengthening approach. These findings are a springboard for designing contextually appropriate interventions for HTN/HIV integration in low- and middle-income countries.","/content/10.1101/19013920v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013920v1.full.pdf","2019-12-09","HIV/AIDS

"Enough evidence and other endings: a descriptive study of stable Cochrane systematic reviews in 2019.","Background:

From 2006 to 2019, Cochrane reviews could be designated ""stable"" if they were not being updated but highly likely to be current. This provides an opportunity to observe practice in ending systematic reviewing and what is regarded as enough evidence.

Methods:

We identified Cochrane reviews designated stable in 2013 and 2019 and reasons for this designation. For those with conclusions stated to be so firm that new evidence is unlikely to change them, we assessed conclusions, strength of evidence ratings, and recommendations for further research. We assessed the fate of the 2013 stable reviews. We also estimated usage of formal analytic methods to determine when there is enough evidence in protocols for Cochrane reviews.

Results:

Cochrane reviews were rarely designated stable. In 2019, there were 507 stable Cochrane reviews (6.6% of 7,645 non-withdrawn reviews). The most common reasons related to no, little, or infrequent research activity expected (331 of 505; 65.5%). Only 39 reviews were stable because of firm conclusions unlikely to be changed by new evidence (7.7%), but that declaration was mostly not supported by judgments made in the review about strength of evidence and implications for research. Among the 180 reviews stable in 2013, 16 reverted to normal status (8.9%), with 2 of those changing conclusions because of new studies. Few Cochrane protocols specified an analytic method for determining when there was enough evidence to stop updating the review (116 of 2,415; 4.8%). 

Conclusion:

Cochrane reviews were more likely to end because important future primary research activity was believed to be unlikely, than because there was enough evidence. Judgments about the strength of evidence and need for research were often inconsistent with the declaration that conclusions were unlikely to change. The inconsistencies underscore the need for reliable analytic methods to support decision-making about the conclusiveness of evidence.","/content/10.1101/19013912v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013912v1.full.pdf","2019-12-09","Epidemiology

"Cystic Glioblastoma Presentation as a Beneficial Prognostic Indicator for Overall Survival","Purpose: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with a median overall survival of 15 months with standard-of-care treatment. GBM can have a cystic component, identifiable through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Previous studies suggest that cysts occur in 7-23% of GBMs and report mixed results regarding its prognostic impact. Using our large retrospective cohort of 493 patients with first-diagnosis GBM, we aim to elucidate this link between cystic GBM and survival.
Methods: Using pretreatment MRIs, we manually identified 88 patients with GBM that had a significant cystic component at presentation.
Results: Compared to patients with noncystic GBM (N=405), patients with cystic GBM had significantly longer overall survival and were significantly younger at presentation. However, among patients who received the current standard-of-care treatment, cystic GBM (N=40) was not significant for outcome. We also did not observe a significant survival benefit when comparing this standard-of-care cystic cohort to patients with cystic GBM diagnosed before the standard was established (N=19), but the analogous result for patients with noncystic GBM gives a sizeable benefit, as expected (N=144, N=111, respectively). We also report differences in the absolute and relative sizes of imaging abnormalities on MRI and the prognostic implication of cysts based on sex.
Conclusion: Together, these results may explain later studies that note no significant survival benefit for patients with cystic GBM receiving current standard-of-care. We discuss hypotheses for these observed differences, including the possibility that the presence of a cyst could indicate a less aggressive tumor.","/content/10.1101/19013813v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013813v1.full.pdf","2019-12-09","Oncology

"Prevalence and impact of oprD mutations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in cystic fibrosis","Defective OprD porins contribute to carbapenem resistance and may be important in Pseudomonas aeruginosa adaptation to cystic fibrosis airways. It is unclear whether oprD mutations are fixed in populations of shared strains that are transmitted between patients or whether novel variants arise during infection. We investigated oprD sequences and antimicrobial resistance of two common Australian shared strains, constructed P. aeruginosa mutants with the most common oprD allelic variants and compared characteristics between patients with or without evidence of infection with strains harbouring these variants. Our data show that three independently acquired nonsense mutations arising from a 1-base pair substitution are fixed in strain sub-lineages. These nonsense mutations are likely to contribute to reduced carbapenem susceptibility in the sub-lineages without compromising in vitro fitness. Not only was lung function worse among patients infected with strains harbouring the nonsense mutations than those without, but they also had an increased hazard rate of lung transplantation/death. Our findings further highlight that understanding adaptive changes may help to distinguish patients with greater adverse outcomes despite infection with the same strain.","/content/10.1101/19013870v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013870v1.full.pdf","2019-12-09","Respiratory Medicine

"A novel methodology to measure waiting times for community-based specialist care in a public healthcare system","Background: Monitoring of waiting time (WT) in healthcare systems is essential, since long WT are associated with adverse health outcomes, reduced patient satisfaction and increased private financing. 
Objective: To develop a methodology for routine national monitoring of WT for community-based non-urgent specialist appointments, in a public healthcare system. 
Design: Observational historical study using data from computerized appointment scheduling systems of all Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) in Israel.  
Data sources: Data included available appointments for community-based specialists and actual number of visits. 
The first 50 available appointments from each specialist appointment book were collected throughout December 2018. Five most frequently visited specialties - orthopedics, ophthalmology, gynecology, dermatology and otolaryngology - were included. 
Data collection/extraction approach: WT offered to HMO members (OWT) were calculated for two scenarios: specific physician and any physician in the clinic's geographical region. Distribution of OWT was calculated separately for each specialty and geographical region, combined to create the nationwide distribution, and expressed as mean, standard deviation and percentiles.
Principal findings: Estimated national median OWT for specific physician, ranged from 6 days (ophthalmology) to 13 days (dermatology), with large variation between geographic regions. OWT for any physician were 28-50% shorter than for specific physician. 
Conclusions: This novel method offers a solution for ongoing national WT measurement, using computerized scheduling systems. It integrates patient preferences for physician choice and allows identification of differences between specialties and regions, setting the ground for interventions to strengthen public healthcare systems.","/content/10.1101/19013367v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013367v1.full.pdf","2019-12-09","Health Systems and Quality Improvement

"A preliminary report on alcohol-associated DNA methylation and suicidal behavior: evidence using Mendelian randomization","Alcohol consumption, a risk factor for suicide, is associated with changes in DNA methylation, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of suicidality. Here, Mendelian randomization probes whether alcohol-associated changes in DNA methylation mediate risk for suicidal behavior. The results suggest that higher alcohol-associated DNA methylation levels at cg18120259 confer a weak causal effect. cg18120259 is instrumented by a cis-methylation quantitative trait locus (rs9472155) that is upstream of VEGFA and associated with circulating VEFG levels. To ascertain whether the cg18120259 finding is confounded by VEGF levels, a Mendelian randomization of VEGF levels on suicidality was performed, revealing a null effect. This implies circulating VEGF levels (observed among suicide attempters) may mark but not cause suicide. Both mechanisms should be re-examined in large replication studies, as the information might be harnessed for early detection of at-risk individuals and possibly save lives.","/content/10.1101/19013300v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013300v1.full.pdf","2019-12-09","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"PSA and VIM DBS efficiency in essential tremor depends on distance to the dentatorubrothalamic tract","Objective: To investigate the relation between deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) and the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) and the distance to the dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRTT) in essential tremor (ET).

Methods: Tremor rating scale (TRS) hemi scores were analyzed in 13 ET patients, stimulated in both the VIM and the PSA in a randomized, crossover trial. Distances of PSA and VIM contacts to population based DRTTs were calculated. The relationships between distance to DRTT and stimulation amplitude, as well as DBS efficiency (TRS improvement per amplitude) were investigated.

Results: PSA contacts were closer to the DRTT (p=0.019) and led to a greater improvement in TRS hemi scores (p=0.005) than VIM contacts. Proximity to the DRTT was related to lower amplitudes (p<0.001) and higher DBS efficiency (p=0.017).

Conclusions: Differences in tremor outcome and stimulation parameters between contacts in the PSA and the VIM can be explained by their different distance to the DRTT.","/content/10.1101/19013656v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013656v1.full.pdf","2019-12-09","Neurology

"Rate of Force Development is Related to Maximal Force, Muscle Quality and Physical Function in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease Predialysis","ABSTRACT 
Background Physical function is severely compromised in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and worsens with continued decreases in kidney function. Neuromuscular force capacity is a key determinant of physical function in healthy older adults, though its importance in persons with CKD is less understood. Methods This study aimed to determine the relationships among rate of force development (RFD), muscle quality and physical function in a group of community-dwelling, middle-aged and older men (n=14; age=71.2+/-6.2 years) with CKD stages 3 and 4 (eGFR=37.5+/-10.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Force characteristics were determined from maximal knee extensor isometric contractions and muscle quality was estimated using ultrasound grayscale analysis. Physical function was assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and 5-repetition sit-to-stand (STS) test. Results eGFR was directly related to SPPB (r=0.54, p=0.044) and inversely related to STS (r=-0.62, p=0.029). RFD was positively related to SPPB at time points 0-50 ms, 50-100 ms, and 0-300 ms (RFD0-50, r=0.73, p=0.010; RFD50-100, r=0.67, p=0.022 and RFD0-300 r=0.61, p=0.045); and inversely related to STS at time points 0-50 ms, 50-100 ms, and 0-300 ms (RFD0-50, r=-0.78, p=0.007; RFD50-100, r=-0.78, p=0.006 and RFD0-300 r=-0.76, p=0.009), respectively. RFD was positively associated with maximal voluntary force (MVF) at times 50-100 ms, 100-200 ms, and 0-300 ms (RFD50-100, r=0.72, p=0.011; RFD100-200, r=0.66, p=0.025; and RFD0-300 r=0.70, p=0.016), respectively. Neither MVF nor muscle quality was significantly associated with functional measures. Conclusions RFD is an important determinant of physical function in middle-aged and older men with CKD stages 3 and 4.","/content/10.1101/19013557v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013557v2.full.pdf","2019-12-11","Nephrology

"Out of hospital cardiac arrests in the Gulf Region: a scoping review","Background
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Recent studies demonstrated low survival rates in Middle Eastern countries. Anecdotally there are unique demographic, cultural and logistical challenges in this region. However, there remains a paucity of data published on OHCA in the Middle East. In order to address OHCA in a meaningful manner in the region, we first need to quantify the issue.

Methods
We conducted a scoping review of published and grey literature on OHCA in the Gulf Cooperative Council region that utilised Arksey and O'Malley's framework. Electronic databases and grey literature sources were identified and searched. Subject matter experts in the region were consulted. All types of studies in English and Arabic were included. 

Results
A total of 24 studies were included from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar. No literature was identified from the state of Bahrain. OHCA victims in the region are younger, predominantly male, and more co-morbid than those in Western studies. We observed low Emergency Medical Service utilisation, low bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, return of spontaneous circulation, and survival to discharge rates across the region. There are differences in characteristics of OHCA among ethnic groups. 

Discussion and conclusions
We identified unique characteristics associated with OHCA in the region, variances in processes and outcomes when compared to Western studies, and a lack of coordinated effort to research and address OHCA. We recommend creating lead agencies responsible for coordinating and developing strategies such as community response, public education, and reporting databases.","/content/10.1101/19014118v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19014118v1.full.pdf","2019-12-11","Emergency Medicine

"Knowledge and attitudes regarding infant BLS among babysitters and nursemaids in north rural Jordan","Background: There is a lack of national data related to the public knowledge and attitudes concerning Basic Life Support (BLS) for an infant. This study is the first to assess the knowledge and attitude regarding infant BLS among babysitters and nursemaids who are working in registered nurseries in North Jordan.
Methods: A semi-structured questionnaire was conducted among a convenience sample of 77 child caretakers (babysitters and nursemaids) who were looking after infants in registered nurseries in the north of Jordan.
Results: The findings show that the majority of participants were not aware of skills for managing foreign body aspiration (or CPR) among infants, while more than two-thirds of them never attended training and or education sessions regarding managing foreign body aspiration among infants. 
Conclusions: This research strongly recommends training for babysitters and care centre staff.  The findings of this study indicated that caregivers in Jordanian kindergartens and nurseries lack awareness regarding safe infant care. As such, there is a lack of basic skills for resuscitation in urgent cases; which can increase the risk of sudden and unexpected child death. Accordingly, the infant life support course is highly recommended for babysitters and nursemaids. Health care professionals could help to implement infant basic life support training courses through local community basic service centres, non-governmental organizations, local associations, universities and health colleges through providing workshops that aim at enhancing knowledge and skills for infant BLS among caregivers and babysitters.","/content/10.1101/19014175v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19014175v1.full.pdf","2019-12-11","Public and Global Health

"Knowledge about benefits and risks of undergoing cataract surgery among cataract patients in Southern China","Objective: To develop a theoretical framework for assessing knowledge about the possible outcomes of undergoing cataract surgery, and explore the association of knowledge level with psychological status and decision quality among patients with cataract in Southern China.
Methods: The details of the knowledge scale were based on the health education information booklet provided by National Eye Institute, NIH. We used a theory-based approach to assess gist knowledge, which comprises conceptual and numeric questions related to knowledge of the possible surgical outcomes. The scale was then used in a cross-sectional study to assess the association of knowledge score with psychological status and decision quality of cataract patients, including worry, anxiety, attitudes, intentions, decisional conflict, confidence in decision making, anticipated regret and temporal orientation. 
Results: A total of 489 participants with age-related cataract were included in this study, and 10.2% (50/489) of them had adequate level of knowledge. The knowledge scale was significantly associated to the levels of worry (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.36, 95%CI: 0.18, 0.70; P = 0.003), anxiety (beta coefficient = -5.36, 95%CI: -8.88,-1.84; P = 0.003), inaction regret (OR = 0.49, 95%CI : 0.28, 0.88; P = 0.016) and decision conflict (beta coefficient = -7.93, 95%CI: -12.81, -3.04; P = 0.002) in multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, education level and literacy level. 
Conclusion: The level of knowledge adequacy with cataract surgery outcomes is high in China and was associated with psychological status and decision quality. These findings suggest that strategies targeting knowledge of possible surgical outcomes may reduce psychological stress and improve decision quality among patients with age-related cataract.","/content/10.1101/19014100v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19014100v1.full.pdf","2019-12-11","Ophthalmology

"Distinct temporal trends in breast cancer incidence from 1997 to 2016 by molecular subtypes: A population-based study of Scottish cancer registry data","Strategies for breast cancer prevention are informed by assessing whether incidence differs by tumour biology. We describe temporal trends of breast cancer incidence by molecular subtypes in Scotland. Population-based cancer registry data on 72,217 women diagnosed with incident primary breast cancer from 1997 to 2016 were analysed. Age-standardised rates (ASR) and age-specific incidence were estimated by tumour subtype after imputing the 8% of missing oestrogen receptor (ER) status. Joinpoint regression and age- period- cohort models were used to assess whether significant differences were observed in incidence trends by ER status. ER positive tumour incidence steadily increased particularly for women of screening age 50 to 69 years from 1997 till around 2011 (1.6%/year, 95%CI: 1.2 to 2.1). ER negative incidence decreased among all ages at a consistent rate of -0.7%/year (95%CI: -1.5, 0) from around 2000-2016. Compared to the 1941-1959 central birth cohort, women born 1912- 1940 had lower incidence rate ratios (IRR) for ER+ tumours and women born 1960- 1986 had higher IRR for ER- tumours. We show evidence of aetiologic heterogeneity of breast cancer. Future incidence and survival reporting should be monitored by molecular subtypes.","/content/10.1101/19011411v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011411v1.full.pdf","2019-12-11","Epidemiology

"Impact and cost-effectiveness of nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccination in Switzerland: insights from a dynamic transmission model","AIM: In Switzerland, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been implemented using a quadrivalent vaccine that covers HPV types 16 and 18, responsible for about 70% of cervical cancer. The average national uptake was 56% in girls by the age of 16 years in 2014-2016. A nonavalent vaccine, covering five additional oncogenic HPV types was recommended at the end of 2018. The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing the nonavalent HPV vaccine in Switzerland compared with the quadrivalent vaccine.

METHODS: We developed a dynamic transmission model that describes the spread of 10 high risk HPV types. We informed the model with Swiss data about sexual behaviour and cervical cancer screening, and calibrated the model to cervical cancer incidence in Switzerland. We modelled the impact of quadrivalent and nonavalent vaccines at the achieved (56%) and national recommended uptake (80%) in girls. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between the nonavalent vaccine, the quadrivalent vaccine and no vaccination. We evaluated costs linked to cervical cancer screening, treatment of different disease stages and vaccination in a sensitivity analysis.

RESULTS: Compared with quadrivalent HPV vaccination in Switzerland at 56% uptake, vaccinating with the nonavalent vaccine would avert 1,175 cervical cancer deaths, 3,641 cases of cervical cancer and 106,898 CIN treatments over 100 years at 56% uptake. Compared with the quadrivalent vaccine, which would prevent an estimated 67% and 72% of cervical cancer cases at 56% and 80% coverage, the nonavalent vaccine would prevent 83% and 89% of all cervical cancers at the same coverage rates. The sensitivity analysis shows that introducing the nonavalent vaccination should improve health outcomes and offers a cost-saving alternative to the quadrivalent vaccine under the current price difference.

CONCLUSIONS: All scenarios with quadrivalent and nonavalent vaccination are likely to be cost-effective compared with no vaccination. Switching to the nonavalent vaccine at current and improved vaccination uptake is likely to be cost-saving under the investigated price difference.","/content/10.1101/19012674v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012674v1.full.pdf","2019-12-11","Health Economics

"The epidemiology of systematic review updates: a longitudinal study of updating of Cochrane reviews, 2003 to 2018.","Background: 

The Cochrane Collaboration has been publishing systematic reviews in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) since 1995, with the intention that these be updated periodically. 

Objectives:

To chart the long-term updating history of a cohort of Cochrane reviews and the impact on the number of included studies.

Methods:

The status of a cohort of Cochrane reviews updated in 2003 was assessed at three time points: 2003, 2011, and 2018. We assessed their subject scope, compiled their publication history using PubMed and CDSR, and compared them to all Cochrane reviews available in 2002 and 2017/18.

Results:

Of the 1,532 Cochrane reviews available in 2002, 11.3% were updated in 2003, with 16.6% not updated between 2003 and 2011. The reviews updated in 2003 were not markedly different to other reviews available in 2002, but more were retracted or declared stable by 2011 (13.3% versus 6.3%). The 2003 update led to a major change of the conclusions of 2.8% of updated reviews (n = 177). The cohort had a median time since publication of the first full version of the review of 18 years and a median of three updates by 2018 (range 1-11). The median time to update was three years (range 0-14 years). By the end of 2018, the median time since the last update was seven years (range 0-15). The median number of included studies rose from eight in the version of the review before the 2003 update, to 10 in that update and 14 in 2018 (range 0-347). 
 
Conclusions:

Most Cochrane reviews get updated, however they are becoming more out-of-date over time. Updates have resulted in an overall rise in the number of included studies, although they only rarely lead to major changes in conclusion.","/content/10.1101/19014134v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19014134v1.full.pdf","2019-12-11","Epidemiology

"Disrupted white matter integrity in treatment-resistant schizophrenia","Treatment response in schizophrenia is heterogeneous and has been posited to divide into three distinct subcategories: treatment-responsive (first-line responders; FLR), treatment-resistant (TRS, responding to clozapine), and ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia (UTRS, requiring augmented antipsychotic therapy). Previous work suggests that white matter abnormalities drive antipsychotic resistance but little work has been carried out to identify differences between those with TRS and those with UTRS. The current study aimed to establish whether differences in white matter structure are present across both treatment-resistant subtypes of schizophrenia or if UTRS is distinct from TRS. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired for 18 individuals with TRS, 14 with UTRS, 18 FLR and 20 healthy controls. Measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and parallel diffusivity (PD) were obtained using tract-based spatial statistics. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc between-groups t-tests interrogating differences were conducted for each white matter measure. Those with TRS had lower FA than healthy controls across widespread regions of the brain, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum, thalamic radiation, corticospinal tract, internal capsule, corona radiata and fronto-occipital fasciculus (p<.05 FWE-corrected). Lower FA was also observed in those with TRS compared with UTRS in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (p<.05 FWE-corrected). However, post-hoc tests failed to survive corrections for multiple comparisons across the 12 post-hoc contrasts. No differences in MD, PD or RD were observed between groups. These data suggest that TRS is distinct from UTRS and that lower FA could act as a biomarker of treatment resistance in people with schizophrenia.","/content/10.1101/19010777v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010777v1.full.pdf","2019-12-11","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

Our objective was to describe the postgraduate education trajectories of family and community physicians in Brazil. In this observational, exploratory study, we used data from SBMFC and SisCNRM to compile the list of physicians and community physicians, and then downloaded their curricula vitae from the Lattes Platform, verifying all data for consistency. A master's degree was held by one in eight, and a Ph.D., by one in forty; most degrees were in collective health. Women (versus men) were less likely to hold master's degrees, and even less likely to hold Ph.D. degrees. Professional (versus academic) master's degrees and those in other areas (versus in medicine or collective health) were also associated with lower probability of obtaining a Ph.D. degree. Certified specialists (versus those with a medical residency) with a postgraduate degree were more likely to have earned it before becoming family and community physicians. We suggest that researchers in public health critically examine the relative benefits of different postgraduate trajectories for the professional performance of family and community physicians.","/content/10.1101/19005744v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005744v2.full.pdf","2019-12-11","Medical Education

"Plasma Proteome Analysis of Patients with Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated (hATTR) Amyloidosis Establishes Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) as a Biomarker of Disease and Treatment Response","Background Hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis is a rare, progressively debilitating, and fatal disease caused by deposition of aggregated transthyretin amyloid in multiple organs and tissues. Highly variable disease penetrance has made it difficult to predict disease onset and progression. Clinically validated, non-invasive plasma biomarkers may facilitate earlier diagnosis and aid monitoring of disease progression.
Methods Plasma levels of >1000 proteins were measured in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy who received either placebo or patisiran in the phase 3 APOLLO study (NCT01960348) and in a cohort of healthy individuals. The impact of patisiran treatment on the time profile of each protein was determined by a linear mixed model at 0, 9, and 18 months. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein was further assessed using an orthogonal quantitative approach.
Findings A significant change in the levels of 66 proteins was observed with patisiran vs placebo, with change in NfL, a marker of neuronal damage, most significant (p<10-20). Analysis of the changes in protein levels demonstrated that the proteome of patients treated with patisiran trended towards healthy individuals at 18 months. Plasma NfL levels in healthy controls were four-fold lower than in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (16.3 [SD 12.0] pg/mL vs 69.4 [SD 42.1] pg/mL, p<10-16). Levels of NfL at 18 months increased with placebo (99.5 [SD 60.1] pg/mL) and decreased with patisiran treatment (48.8 [SD 29.9] pg/mL). At 18 months, improvement in modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7) in patisiran-treated patients significantly correlated with a reduction in NfL levels (R=0.43, p<10-7).
Interpretation The observed correlation of NfL reduction with patisiran treatment and improvement in mNIS+7 suggests it may serve as a biomarker of nerve damage and polyneuropathy in hATTR amyloidosis. This biomarker may enable earlier diagnosis of polyneuropathy in patients with hATTR amyloidosis and facilitate monitoring of disease progression.","/content/10.1101/19011155v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011155v2.full.pdf","2019-12-11","Neurology

"Mapping Psilocybin-Assisted Therapies: A Scoping Review","We conducted a scoping review on psilocybin-assisted therapy for addiction, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Psilocybin is a naturally-occurring tryptophan derivative found in species of mushroom with psycho-active properties. From 2022 records identified by database searching, 40 publications were included in the qualitative synthesis from which we identified 9 clinical trials with a total of 169 participants. Trials used a peak-psychedelic model of therapy, emphasizing inward journey through the use of eyeshades, set musical scores and with medium to high doses of psilocybin. No serious adverse effects were reported; mild adverse effects included transient anxiety, nausea and post-treatment headaches. Overall, the 9 trials all demonstrated safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in the treatments of obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder, treatment-resistant unipolar depression, anxiety or depression in patients with life-threatening cancer and demoralization among long-term AIDS survivors.The literature was found to be early and exploratory, with several limitations: only 5 were randomized controlled trials, small and homogenous patient sample size, difficulties in blinding, and the confounding influence of psychological supports provided. Further research is indicated to establish effectiveness for these and other indications, with a more diverse range of patients, and with differing program and dosing modalities.

"Genetic analysis of functional rare germline variants across 9 cancer types from the DiscovEHR study","Rare variants play an essential role in the etiology of cancer and characterizing rare germline variants that impact the risk of cancer is an ongoing challenge. We performed a genome-wide rare variant analysis using germline whole exome sequencing (WES) data derived from the Geisinger MyCode initiative to discover cancer predisposition variants. The analysis was conducted using 5,538 cancer patients and 7,286 matched controls in a discovery set and 1,991 cancer patients and 2,504 matched controls in a validation set across nine cancer types. The variants in the WES data were annotated and filtered for pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants using ClinVar and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP). After filtering, case-control association tests were conducted on each cancer type separately by binning the pathogenic and likely pathogenic rare variants into genes and pathways using SKAT-O. We discovered 87 genes and 106 pathways significantly associated with cancer (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05) out of which seven genes and 26 pathways replicated from the validation set (suggestive threshold P < 0.05). Further, four genes and 21 pathways were discovered to be associated with multiple cancers (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05). Additionally, we identified 13 genes and two pathways associated with survival outcome across seven cancers (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05), where two genes, PCDHB8 and DCHS2, were also associated with survival outcome in TCGA data. In summary, we conducted one of the largest pan-cancer association studies using germline data derived from a single hospital system to find novel predisposition genes and pathways associated with nine cancers. Our results can inform future guidelines for germline genetic testing in cancer, which will be helpful in screening for cancer high-risk patients. This work adds to the knowledge base and progress being made in precision medicine.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.09.19013334v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.09.19013334v1.full.pdf","2019-12-12","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"The influence of common polygenic risk and gene sets on social skills group training response in autism spectrum disorder","Social skills group training (SSGT) is one of the most frequently used behavior interventions in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Current evidence suggests that the effects are moderate and heterogeneous. Genetic predisposition could be one of the factors contributing to this heterogeneity. Therefore, we used polygenic risk score (PRS) and gene-set analysis to investigate the association between SSGT response and common variants in autistic individuals. Participants from the largest randomized clinical trial of SSGT in ASD to date were selected for genotyping. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and educational attainment (EA) were calculated, and their associations with the intervention outcome at post-intervention and follow-up were tested using mixed linear model. In addition, thirty-two gene sets within five categories (synaptic, glial, FMRP, glutamate, and mitochondrial) were selected to evaluate their role in the intervention outcome. Individuals with higher PRSs for ASD and ADHD had inferior response after SSGT. After multiple test correction, significant results were kept for higher ADHD PRS at follow-up ( = 6.67, p = 0.016). Five gene sets within synaptic category showed modest association with reduced response to SSGT in ASD. Taken together, we provided preliminary evidence that genetic liability calculated using PRS and common variants in synapse gene sets could influence the outcome of SSGT. Our results hold promise for future research into the genetic contribution to individual response to ASD interventions, and should be validated in larger cohorts.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.04.19013888v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.04.19013888v1.full.pdf","2019-12-12","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Semantic Enrichment of Streaming Healthcare Data","In the past decade, the healthcare industry has made significant advances in the digitization of patient information. However, a lack of interoperability among healthcare systems still imposes a high cost to patients, hospitals, and insurers. Currently, most systems pass messages using idiosyncratic messaging standards that require specialized knowledge to interpret. This increases the cost of systems integration and often puts more advanced uses of data out of reach. In this project, we demonstrate how two open standards, FHIR and RDF, can be combined both to integrate data from disparate sources in real-time and make that data queryable and susceptible to automated inference. To validate the effectiveness of the semantic engine, we perform simulations of real-time data feeds and demonstrate how they can be combined and used by client-side applications with no knowledge of the underlying sources.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.01.19013615v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.01.19013615v1.full.pdf","2019-12-12","Health Informatics

"A polygenic risk score for rheumatoid arthritis sheds light on the Prevotella association","Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease associated with reduced life expectancy. It is heritable and an extensive repertoire of genetic variants have been identified. The gut microbiota may represent an environmental risk factor for RA. Indeed, Prevotella copri is a candidate keystone species, but whether it lies on the causal pathway for disease or is simply a bystander reflecting host-genetic predisposition to RA, remains to be determined. The study of disease-microbiota associations may be confounded by the presence of the disease of interest or by its treatment. To circumvent this issue, we assessed whether known RA risk alleles were associated with the gut microbiota, in a large who do not have RA.
Methods: Blood and stool acquired from volunteers from TwinsUK were used for genotyping and assessment of the gut microbiota, respectively. A weighted polygenic risk score (PRS) for RA was calculated in 1650 unaffected twins from the TwinsUK cohort, based on 233 published GWAS-identified published RA associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were generated from 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples and assessed for association with RA PRS. Confirmation of findings was performed using an independent sample comprised of first-degree relatives of RA patients from the SCREEN-RA cohort (n=133).
Findings: We found that Prevotella spp was positively associated with RA PRS in TwinsUK participants (p.adj<1e-7). This finding was validated in SCREEN-RA participants carrying the shared epitope risk alleles (p.adj=1.12e-3). An association of Prevotella spp. with pre-clinical RA phases was also demonstrated(p.adj=0.021).
Interpretation: Prevotella in the gut microbiota is associated with RA genotype in the absence of RA, as well as in subjects at high risk of developing RA. This work suggests that host genotype is associated with microbiota profile prior to disease onset.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.09.19014183v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.09.19014183v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Rheumatology

"A novel art of continuous non-invasive blood pressure measurement","Wearable sensors to continuously measure blood pressure (BP) and derived cardiovascular variables have the potential to revolutionize patient monitoring. Current wearable methods analyzing time components (e.g., pulse transit time) still lack clinical accuracy, whereas existing technologies for direct BP measurement are too bulky. Here we present a new art of continuous non-invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring (CNAP2GO). It directly measures BP by using a new ""volume control technique"" and could be used for small wearable sensors integrated in a finger ring. As a software prototype, CNAP2GO showed excellent BP measurement performance in comparison with invasive BP in 46 patients having surgery. The resulting pulsatile BP signal carries information to derive cardiac output and other hemodynamic variables. We show that CNAP2GO can be miniaturized for wearable approaches. CNAP2GO potentially constitutes the breakthrough for wearable sensors for blood pressure and flow monitoring in both ambulatory and in-hospital clinical settings.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19013938v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19013938v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Towards early risk biomarkers: serum metabolic signature in childhood predicts cardio-metabolic risk in adulthood","Cardiovascular diseases have their origin in childhood. Early biomarkers identifying individuals with increased risk for disease are needed to support early detection and to optimize prevention strategies. By applying machine learning approach on high throughput NMR-based metabolomics data, we identified metabolic predictors of cardiovascular risk in circulation in a cohort of 396 females, followed from childhood (mean age 11.2 years) to early adulthood (mean age 18.1 years). The identified childhood metabolic signature included three circulating biomarkers robustly associating with increased cardiovascular risk in early adulthood (AUC = 0.641 to 0.802, all p<0.01). These associations were confirmed in two validation cohorts including middle-aged women, with similar effect estimates. We subsequently applied random intercept cross-lagged panel model analysis, which suggested causal relationship between metabolites and cardio-metabolic risk score from childhood to early adulthood. These results provide evidence for the utility of circulating metabolomics panel to identify children and adolescents at risk for cardiovascular disease, to whom preventive measures and follow-up could be indicated.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014308v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014308v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Epidemiology

"Assessment and Utilization of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measures to Improve Cardiovascular Disease Prevention","Background:
The American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7) consist of clinical factors and health-related behaviors associated with cardiovascular health. The prevalence of these health factors among patients seeking specialized cardiovascular care is unknown. We sought to quantify patient-reported cardiovascular risk among those seeking specialized cardiovascular care and implement tailored quality improvement interventions.

Methods and Results:
Patients cared for by cardiovascular specialists at an academic medical center were surveyed with a modified LS7. We compared the prevalence of optimal health factors by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) status. Recent smokers or patients with ASCVD reporting non-adherence to antiplatelets or statins were contacted. 

Surveys for 5,950 patients were collected during 2014 to 2016. The mean (SD) age was 64 (15) years, 2613 (44%) were women, and 3478 (58%) had ASCVD. Only 34 (0.6 %) achieved ideal status for all 7 factors, which did not differ by ASCVD status (P=0.48). Of 404 (6.8%) reporting recent smoking, 94/404 (23.3%) were successfully contacted, and 71/404 (17.6%) accepted support. Among those with ASCVD, 84 (2.4%) reported not taking a statin/antiplatelet without contraindications. 

Conclusions:
The prevalence of optimal health factors, including health-related behaviors, among patients cared for by cardiovascular specialists remains low. Assessment of patient-reported outcomes facilitates scalable interventions to improve cardiovascular disease prevention.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014399v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014399v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Genetic Polymorphisms, Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and Microbiota-Associated Urolithin Metabotypes: A Complex Cocktail to Predict the Obesity in Childhood-Adolescence","Environmental and genetic factors are associated with pandemic obesity since childhood. However, the association of overweight-obesity with these factors, acting as a consortium, has been scarcely studied in children. We aimed here to assess the probabilities of being overweighed-obese in a randomly recruited cohort of Spanish children and adolescents (n=415, 517 years-old) by estimating the odds ratios for different predictor variables, and their relative importance in the prediction. The predictor variables were ethnicity, age, sex, adherence to the Mediterranean diet (KIDMED), physical activity, urolithin metabotypes (UM-A, UM-B, and UM-0) as biomarkers of the gut microbiota, and 53 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 43 genes mainly related to obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. A proportional-odds logistic ordinal regression, validated through bootstrap, was used to model the data. While every variable was not independently associated with overweight-obesity, however, the ordinal logistic model revealed that overweight-obesity prevalence was related to being a young boy with either UM-B or UM-0, low KIDMED score and high contribution of a consortium of 24 SNPs, being rs1801253-ADRB1, rs4343-ACE, rs8061518-FTO, rs1130864-CRP, rs659366-UCP2, rs6131-SELP, rs12535708-LEP, rs1501299-ADIPOQ, rs708272-CETP and rs2241766-ADIPOQ the top-ten contributing SNPs.

"Optically Pumped Magnetoencephalography in Epilepsy","Our aim was to demonstrate the first use of Optically Pumped Magnetoencephalography (OP-MEG) in an epilepsy patient with unrestricted head movement. Current clinical MEG uses a traditional SQUID system for recording MEG signal, where sensors are cryogenically cooled and housed in a helmet in which the patient's head is fixed. Here we use a different type of sensor (OPM), which operates at room temperature and can be placed directly on the patient's scalp, permitting free head movement. We performed two 30 minute OP-MEG recording sessions in a patient with refractory focal epilepsy and compared these with clinical scalp EEG performed earlier. OP-MEG was able to identify analogous interictal activity to scalp EEG, and source localise this activity to an appropriate brain region. This is the first application of OP-MEG in human epilepsy. Future directions include simultaneous EEG/OP-MEG recording and prolonged OP-MEG telemetry.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014423v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014423v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14",NA,"Vivekananda","/highwire/citation/70625/bibtext",6,"151219-6","15/12/2019","70625"
"Prevalence and associated factors of pterygium among adults living in Kolla diba town, Northwest Ethiopia","Purpose:
The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of pterygium among adults in Kolla Diba town, Northwest Ethiopia, 2019.
Method: 
A community-based cross-sectional study was done in Kolla Diba town from May 30-June 16, 2019. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 627 study participants. Data was collected through basic ophthalmic examination with a portable slit lamp, 3x magnifying loop and torchlight and a pretested structured questionnaire were administered to collect the data. Then the data entered into EPI INFO version 7 and analyzed using SPSS version 20.  Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analysis were employed. P-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Result:
A total of 605 study participants were involved with a response rate of 96.5%. Among them 317 (52.4%) participants were males. The mean age of the respondents was 38.18 +/- 15.56 with a range of (18-95) in years. The overall Prevalence of pterygium among adults living in Kolla Diba town was 112 (18.5% (95% CI (15.6- 21.7)). Being widowed (AOR = 7.32 (95%CI: 2.88, 18.57)), outdoor occupation (AOR = 2.50 (95%CI: 1.46, 4.29)), sun exposure (AOR = 2.38 (95%CI: 1.28, 4.43)), wind exposure (AOR = 1.97 (95%CI: 1.04, 3.72)), alcohol drinking (AOR = 2.26 (95%CI: 1.48, 4.63)), and severe blepharitis (AOR = 2.45 (95%CI: 1.48, 4.05)) had statistically significant positive association with pterygium.
Conclusion:
The prevalence of pterygium was relatively higher. Marital status (being widowed), outdoor occupation, sun exposure, wind exposure, alcohol drinking, and severe blepharitis were significantly associated with the development of pterygium.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014290v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014290v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Ophthalmology

"Considering the APOE locus in polygenic scores for Alzheimer's disease","Polygenic scores are a strategy to aggregate the small, additive effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome. With phenotypes like Alzheimer's disease, which have a strong and well established genomic locus (APOE), the cumulative effect of genetic variants outside of this area has not been well established in a population-representative sample. Here we examine the association between polygenic scores both with and without the APOE region at different P value thresholds. We also investigate the addition of APOE-e4 carrier status and its effect on the polygenic score - dementia association. We found that including the APOE region through weighted variants in a polygenic score was insufficient to capture the large amount of risk attributed to this region. We recommend removing this region from polygenic score calculation and treating the APOE locus as an independent covariate.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014365v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014365v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Epidemiology

"Clustering of susceptible individuals within households can drive an outbreak: an individual-based model exploration","When estimating important measures such as the herd immunity threshold, and the corresponding efforts required to eliminate measles, it is often assumed that susceptible individuals are uniformly distributed throughout populations. However, unvaccinated individuals may be clustered in a variety of ways, including by geographic location, by age, in schools, or in households. Here, we investigate to which extent different levels of within-household clustering of susceptible individuals may impact the risk and persistence of measles outbreaks. To this end, we apply an individual-based model, Stride, to a population of 600,000 individuals, using data from Flanders, Belgium. We compare realistic scenarios regarding the distribution of susceptible individuals within households in terms of their impact on epidemiological measures for outbreak risk and persistence. We find that higher levels of within-household clustering of susceptible individuals increase the risk, size and persistence of measles outbreaks. Ignoring within-household clustering thus leads to underestimations of measles elimination and outbreak mitigation efforts.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014282v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014282v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Epidemiology

"Using the Bayesian credible subgroups method to identify populations benefiting from treatment: An application to the Look AHEAD trial","Traditionally, subgroup analyses are used to assess whether patient characteristics moderate treatment effectiveness with general disregard for issues of multiplicity. Using data from The Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) trial in the United States, we aim to identify a subgroup where all of its types of members experience a treatment benefit defined as reducing the likelihood of a major cardiovascular event under an intensive lifestyle and weight-loss intervention. We apply the credible subgroups method to a Bayesian logistic model with a conservative prior that is sceptical of large treatment effect heterogeneity. The covariate profiles for which there is sufficient evidence of treatment benefit are, coarsely, middle-aged women, in poor subjective general health and with moderately to poorly controlled diabetes. There is at least 80% posterior probability that the conditional average treatment effect is positive for all covariate profiles fitting this description, which account for 0.5% of trial participants. Conversely, the covariate profiles that are likely to be associated with no benefit are middle aged and older men in excellent subjective general health, with well-controlled diabetes. These profiles apply to less than 2% of trial participants. More information is required to determine treatment benefit or no benefit for the remainder of the trial population.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014357v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014357v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Health Economics

"Risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients with multiple sclerosis: record-linkage studies","Background: The epidemiology of psychiatric comorbidity in multiple sclerosis (MS) remains poorly understood. Objective: We aimed to determine the risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in MS patients. Material and Methods: Retrospective cohort analyses were performed using an all-England national linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset (1999-2016) and to determine whether schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are more commonly diagnosed subsequently in people with MS (n=128,194), and whether MS is more commonly diagnosed subsequently in people with schizophrenia (n=384,188) or bipolar disorder (n=203,592), than would be expected when compared with a reference cohort (~15 million people) after adjusting for age and other factors. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Findings were dependent on whether the index and subsequent diagnoses were selected as the primary reason for hospital admission or were taken from anywhere on the hospital record. When searching for diagnoses anywhere on the hospital record, there was a significantly elevated risk of subsequent schizophrenia (aHR 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 1.60) and of bipolar disorder (aHR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.24) in people with prior-recorded MS and of subsequent MS in people with prior-recorded schizophrenia (aHR 1.26, 1.15-1.37) or bipolar disorder (aHR 1.73, 1.57-1.91), but most of these associations were reduced to null when analyses were confined to diagnoses recorded as the primary reason for admission. Conclusion: Further research is needed to investigate the potential association between MS and schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder as it may shed light on underlying pathophysiology and help identify potential shared risk factors.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.09.19014258v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.09.19014258v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Neurology

"Screening of Diabetes and Hypertension Based on Retinal Fundus Photographs Using Deep Learning","Purpose:  The aim of this study was to use deep learning to screen for hypertension and diabetes based on retinal fundus images. 
Methods:  We collected 1160 retinal photographs which included 580 from patients with a diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes and 580 from normotensive and non-diabetic control. We divided this image dataset into (i) a development dataset to develop model and (ii) test dataset which were not present during the training process to assess model's performance. A binary classification model was trained by fine-tuning the classifier and the last convolution layer of deep residual network. Precision, recall, the area under the ROC (AUC), and the area under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPR) were used to evaluate the performance of the learned model. 
Results:  When we used 3-channel color retinal photographs to train and test model, its prediction precision for diabetes or hypertension was 65.3%, the recall was 82.5%, the AUC was 0.745, and the AUPR was 0.742. When we used grayscale retinal photographs to train and test model, its prediction precision was 70.0%, the recall was 87.5%, the AUC was 0.803, and the AUPR was 0.779. 
Conclusions:  Our study shows that trained deep learning model based on the retinal fundus photographs alone can be used to screen for diabetes and hypertension, although its current performance was not ideal.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19013904v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19013904v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Ophthalmology

"Precision Multiparameter Tracking of Inflammation on Timescales of Hours to Years Using Serial Dried Blood Spots","High-frequency longitudinal tracking of inflammation using dried blood microsamples provides a new window for personalized monitoring of infections, chronic inflammatory disease, and clinical trials of anti-inflammatory drugs. Using 1,662 dried blood spot samples collected by 16 subjects over periods of weeks to years, we studied the behavior of 12 acute phase response (APR) and related proteins in inflammation events correlated with infection, vaccination, surgery, intense exercise and Crohn's disease. Proteins were measured using SISCAPA mass spectrometry and normalized to constant plasma volume using low-variance proteins, generating high precision within-person biomarker trajectories with well-characterized personal baselines. The results shed new light on the dynamic regulation of APR proteins and offer a new approach to visualization of multidimensional inflammation trajectories.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.09.19014233v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.09.19014233v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Pharmacology and Therapeutics

"Metabolomics pilot study identifies circadian desynchronization and distinct intra-patient variability patterns in critical illness","Background: Synchronized circadian rhythms play a key role in coordinating physiologic health. Desynchronized circadian rhythms may predispose individuals to disease or be indicative of underlying disease. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients likely experience desynchronized circadian rhythms due to disruptive environmental conditions in the ICU and underlying pathophysiology. This observational pilot study was undertaken to determine if circadian rhythms are altered in ICU patients relative to healthy controls by profiling circadian rhythms in vital signs and plasma metabolites.

Methods: We monitored circadian rhythms in 5 healthy controls and 5 ICU patients for 24 hours. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured every 30 minutes, temperature was measured every hour, and blood was sampled for mass spectrometry-based plasma metabolomics every 4 hours. Bedside sound levels were measured every minute. Circadian rhythms were evaluated in vitals and plasma metabolites individually and in each group using the cosinor method.

Results: ICU patient rooms were significantly louder than healthy controls' rooms and average noise levels were above EPA recommendations. Healthy controls generally had significant circadian rhythms individually and as a group. While a few ICU patients had significant circadian rhythms in isolated variables, no significant rhythms were identified in ICU patients as a group, except in cortisol. This indicates a lack of coherence in circadian phases and amplitudes among ICU patients. Finally, principal component analysis of metabolic profiles showed surprising patterns in plasma sample clustering. Each ICU patient's samples were clearly discernable in individual clusters, separate from a single cluster of healthy controls.

Conclusions: ICU patients' circadian rhythms show significant desynchronization compared to healthy controls. Clustering of plasma metabolic profiles suggests that metabolomics could be used to track individual patients' clinical courses longitudinally. Our results show global disordering of metabolism and the circadian system in ICU patients which should be characterized further in order to determine implications for patient care.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.09.19014225v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.09.19014225v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine

"Malignant pleural effusions as an alternative to biopsies for the detection of EGFR TKI sensitizing mutations","Lung cancer is the cause of a fourth of all cancer related deaths. About a third of all lung adenocarcinoma tumours harbour mutations on exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Patients having these mutations are treated with EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and show better clinical outcomes. Detection of these mutations must be both accurate and timely. We utilized malignant pleural effusions for EGFR mutation detection. We started with a direct sequencing approach and detected a common exon 19 deletion. We then attempted to test the sensitivity of this method by sequencing this sample diluted with wildtype DNA. While signatures of this large deletion were detectable even in a 1 part mutant and 99 part wildtype mixture, this method was going to limit our ability to detect single base pair mutations confidently from pleural effusions. We then tried a EGFR mutant-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay on n=10 pleural effusion samples (1 non-malignant pleural effusion as an internal negative control). 5/9 (55.55%) samples harboured EGFR mutations with 2/9 (22.22%) being exon 19 deletions and 3/9 (33.33%) had the S768I exon 20 mutation. These data suggest malignant pleural effusions may be a utilized to detect mutations even before a biopsy is made available. The high rate of S768I mutations seen in our study suggests that cancer cells harbouring these mutations may be superior in their ability to migrate, home or reside in pleural fluid.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.08.19014167v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.08.19014167v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"What is the best evidence for graft choice in ACL reconstruction? Protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is one of the most commonly performed sports medicine procedures. A variety of grafts are currently used for reconstruction, including both allograft and autograft. Despite numerous meta-analyses, there exists no high-quality quantitative synthesis of all randomized controlled trial (RCT) data on graft choice.
Objective: To identify the optimal graft choice for ACL reconstruction by performing the first systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to include both functional outcomes and complications.
Methods: Multiple digital databases including MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL will be searched independently and in duplicate for RCTs randomizing graft choice in ACL reconstruction in skeletally mature patients. A Bayesian framework with a random-effects model will be used for NMA. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values will be used to generate a rank list for each outcome. Results will be reported as mean differences (MD) (or standardized mean difference, if necessary) or relative risk (RR) with 95% credible intervals (CI). Comparisons will be inferred to be statistically significant if the 95% CI of MD does not cross zero or if the 95% CI of relative risk does not cross one. Studies will be assessed for quality using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Quality of evidence for each network comparison will be determined as per the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for network meta-analyses. This NMA will be reported according to the PRISMA extension statement for network meta-analyses
Outcomes of interest: Functional outcomes of interest including range of motion, return to activity/sport, and IKDC, Lysholm, Tegner, ACL-QOL, and KOOS scores. Persistent laxity as measured by Lachman, Pivot-shift, side-to-side, and measured laxity (e.g. KT-1000) will also be analyzed. Complications (e.g. infection, graft failure, donor site pain), tunnel osteolysis, and failure (including but not limited to graft rupture and/or persistent laxity) will be compared between grafts.
Relevance/Impact: This NMA will be the first high-quality syntheses of all randomized evidence regarding graft choice in ACL reconstruction. As the first analysis to compare all major graft choices independently, it will be used to inform surgeon-patient decision making. It has the reasonable possibility of changing clinical practice.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014266v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014266v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Orthopedics

"Planning sEEG implantation using automated lesion detection: retrospective feasibility study","Objective: A retrospective, cross-sectional study to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of incorporating deep-learning on structural MRI into planning stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) implantation in paediatric patients with diagnostically complex drug-resistant epilepsy. This study aims to assess the degree of co-localisation between automated lesion detection and the seizure onset zone (SOZ) as assessed by sEEG. Methods: A neural network classifier was applied to cortical features from MRI data from three cohorts. 1) The network was trained and cross-validated using 34 patients with visible focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs). 2) Specificity was assessed in 20 paediatric healthy controls. 3) Feasibility for incorporation into sEEG implantation plans was evaluated in 38 sEEG patients. Coordinates of sEEG contacts were coregistered with classifier-predicted lesions. sEEG contacts in seizure onset and irritative tissue were identified by clinical neurophysiologists. A distance of <10mm between SOZ contacts and classifier-predicted lesions was considered co-localisation. Results: In patients with radiologically-defined lesions, classifier sensitivity was 74% (25/34 lesions detected). No clusters were detected in the controls (specificity 100%). Of 34 sEEG patients, 21 patients had a focal cortical SOZ. Of these there was co-localisation between classifier output and SOZ contacts in 62%. The algorithm detected 7/8 histopathologically-confirmed FCDs (86%). Conclusions: There was a high degree of co-localisation between automated lesion detection and sEEG. We have created a framework for incorporation of deep-learning based MRI lesion detection into sEEG implantation planning. Our findings demonstrate that automated MRI analysis could be used to plan optimal electrode trajectories.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.08.19013979v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.08.19013979v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Neurology

"Imagination exercises improve language in younger but not in older children with autism suggesting a strong critical period","Based on a few cases of childhood traumatic aphasia and hemispherectomy, Lenneberg suggested a critical period for first language acquisition. Lenneberg's ideas are still debated today and have never been tested in a large group of children. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) provides such an opportunity as language acquisition is a common problem in ASD. Here, we report data from a three-year-long observational trial of 8,766 children with ASD. We initiated this trial in order to test two hypotheses: 1) voluntary imagination is central to complex language and 2) there exists a strong critical period for voluntary imagination acquisition closing shortly after the age of 5. Accordingly, we developed imagination exercises (verbal and nonverbal), organized them into an application called Mental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) and provided this MITA app gratis to children ages 2 to 12. MITA-experienced children (N=3,540) were matched to the 'treatment-as-usual' participants (TaU, N=5,226). Both younger (2-5 years of age) and older children (5-12 YOA) in MITA and TaU groups improved their language over time, but on an annualized basis, younger MITA children improved their language 3-fold faster than TaU group. There was no difference between MITA and TaU in the older children group. These findings support Lenneberg's critical period hypothesis and indicate that acquisition of voluntary imagination is essential for the full language acquisition. Crucially, our results imply that the underlying plasticity dramatically diminishes after the age of five and therefore even greater therapeutic intervention should be targeting the very first years of a child's life.

"Financial interests and evidence in public comments on the FDA framework for modifications to artificial intelligence/machine learning-based medical devices","The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed a regulatory framework for modifications to artificial intelligence/machine learning-based software as a medical device (SaMD). We analysed the 125 non-duplicate and non-spam public comments on the proposed framework and found that industry and other parties with a potential financial interest contributed a minimum of 63% of comments and that the absence of a conflict of interest could be confirmed in only 8%. Despite the FDA's stated commitment to using scientific evidence in the rule-making process, the vast majority of submitted comments (86%) did not cite any scientific literature, just 4% cited a systematic review or meta-analysis, and no comments indicated whether a systematic process was used to identify relevant literature. We recommend that the FDA requires disclosure of conflicts of interest in comments in the future. As the framework continues to be modified, engagement from non-conflicted parties and better use of scientific evidence may help to ensure the development of a regulatory system that best promotes patient interests.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19013953v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19013953v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Health Policy

"Using Media to Promote Public Awareness of Early Detection of Kaposi's Sarcoma in Africa","Background: Despite its hallmark cutaneous presentation, most Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in Africa is diagnosed too late for effective treatment.  Early diagnosis will only be achievable if patients with KS present earlier for care.  We hypothesized that public awareness about KS can be enhanced through exposure to common media.
Methods: We developed educational messages regarding early detection of KS for the general African public portraying a three-part theme: Look (regularly examine one's skin/mouth); Show (bring to the attention of a healthcare provider any skin/mouth changes); and Test (ask for a biopsy for definitive diagnosis).  We packaged the messages in three common media forms (comic strips, radio, and video) and tested their effect on increasing KS awareness among adults attending markets in Uganda.  Participants were randomized to a single exposure to one of the media and evaluated for change in KS-related knowledge and attitudes.
Results: Among 420 participants, media exposure resulted in increased ability to identify KS (from 0.95% pre-test to 46% post-test); awareness that anyone is at risk for KS (29% to 50%); belief that they may be at risk (63% to 76%); and knowledge that definitive diagnosis requires biopsy (23% to 51%) (all p<0.001).  Most participants (96%) found the media culturally appropriate.
Conclusion:  Exposure to media featuring a theme of Look, Show, Test resulted in changes in knowledge and attitudes concerning KS among the general public in Uganda.  High incidence and poor survival of KS in Africa are an impetus to further evaluate these media, which are freely available online.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19013649v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19013649v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Oncology

We have earlier attempted to understand the clinical genetic makeup of CPC and identified genes responsible for the disease using whole exome sequencing (WES). Here we report our studies of CPC, by identifying de novo heterozygous missense mutations in 16 proband-parent trios and further discover variants of unknown significance which could provide insights into CPC manifestation and its etiology. Our study confirms candidate mutations in genes, viz. C7orf57, C10orf120, C9orf84 and MUC16, CTC1 particularly emphasizing the role of hypothetical genes or open reading frames causing this developmental disorder. Variant validation revealed disease causing mutations associated with CPC and genitourinary diseases which could close the gaps of surgery in bringing intervention in therapies.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19013680v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19013680v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Genetic and Epigenetic Intratumor Heterogeneity Impacts Prognosis of Lung Adenocarcinoma","Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) of genomic alterations may impact prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We investigated ITH of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), DNA methylation, and point mutations in lung cancer driver genes in 292 tumor samples from 84 LUAD patients. We found substantial SCNA and methylation ITH, and clonal architecture analyses showed congruent evolutionary trajectories for SCNAs and DNA methylation aberrations. Interestingly, methylation ITH mapping to gene promoter areas or tumor suppressor genes was low. Moreover, ITH composed of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms altering the same cancer driver genes was found in several tumors. To quantify ITH for valid statistical association analyses we developed an average pairwise ITH index (APITH), which does not depend on the number of samples per tumor. APITH indexes for SCNAs and methylation aberrations were both significantly associated with poor prognosis. This study further establishes the important clinical implications of genetic and epigenetic ITH in LUAD.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.09.19013672v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.09.19013672v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Informing Pharmacokinetic Models with Physiological Data: Oral Population Modeling of L-Serine in Humans","To determine how to set optimal oral L-serine (serine) dose levels for a clinical trial, existing literature was surveyed. Data sufficient to set the dose was inadequate, and so a (n=10) Phase I-A calibration trial was performed, administering serine with and without other oral agents.  We analyzed the trial and the literature data using pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and statistical analysis. The therapeutic goal is to modulate specific serine-related metabolic pathways in the liver using the lowest possible dose which gives the desired effect since the upper bound was expected to be limited by toxicity. In this paper, we first review relevant literature, describe the calibration trial and resulting data, and present the results of modeling from the trial. Serine is a non-essential amino acid that is nonetheless present at a base level in blood from both dietary sources and endogenous production. Serine is consumed by several pathways. A standard PK approach, in which a common model structure was selected using a fit to data, yielded a model with a single central compartment corresponding to plasma, clearance from that compartment, and an endogenous source of serine. The lack of intravenous data normally prevents independent determination of bioavailability and volume of distribution, however, under some assumptions about endogenous synthesis and use, values could be estimated. The model was poorly conditioned but did give consistent estimates. To improve conditioning, a parametric structure was changed to estimate ratios (bioavailability over volume, for example). Model fit quality was improved and the uncertainty in estimated parameters was reduced. Because of the particular interest in the fate of serine, the model was used to estimate whether serine is consumed in the gut, absorbed by the liver, or entered the blood in either a free state, or in a protein- or tissue-bound state that is not measured by our assay. The PK model structure was set up to represent relevant physiology, and this quantitative systems biology approach allowed a broader set of physiological data to be used to narrow parameter and prediction confidence intervals, and to better understand the biological meaning of the data. The model results allowed us to determine the optimal human dose for future trials, including a trial design component including IV and tracer studies. A key contribution is that we were able to use human physiological data from the literature to inform the PK model and to set reasonable bounds on parameters, and to improve model conditioning. Leveraging literature data produced a more predictive, useful model.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.07.19011429v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.07.19011429v1.full.pdf","2019-12-14","Pharmacology and Therapeutics

"Biological age in UK Biobank: biomarker composition and prediction of mortality, coronary heart disease and hospital admissions","Background: Age is the strongest risk factor for most chronic diseases, and yet individuals may age at different rates biologically. A biological age formed from biomarkers may be a stronger risk factor than chronological age and understanding what factors contribute to it could provide insight into new opportunities for disease prevention. 
Methods and findings: Among 480,019 UK Biobank participants aged 40-70 recruited in 2006-2010 and followed up for 6-12 years via linked death registry and secondary care records, a subpopulation of 141,254 (29.4%) non-smoking adults in good health and with no medication use or disease history at baseline were identified. Independent components of 72 biomarkers measured at baseline were characterised by principal component analysis. The Klemera Doubal method (KDM), which derived a weighted sum of biomarker principal components based on the strengths of their linear associations with chronological age, was used to derive sex-specific biological ages in this healthy subpopulation. The proportions of the overall biological and chronological age effects on mortality, coronary heart disease and age-related non-fatal hospital admissions (based on a hospital frailty index) that were explained by biological age were assessed using log-likelihoods of proportional hazards models. 
Reduced lung function, reduced kidney function, slower reaction time, lower insulin-like-growth factor 1, lower hand grip strength and higher blood pressure were key contributors to biological age (explaining the highest percentages of its variance) in both men and women, while lower albumin, higher sex hormone-binding globulin and lower muscle mass in men, and higher liver enzymes, blood lipids and HbA1c in women were also important. Across both sexes, a 51-principal component biological age explained 66%, 80% and 63% of the age effects on mortality, coronary heart disease and hospital admissions, respectively. Restricting the biological age to the 12-13 key biomarkers corresponding to the 10 most importantly contributing principal components resulted in little change in these proportions for women, but a reduction to 53%, 63% and 50%, respectively, for men. 
Conclusions: This study identified that markers of impaired function in a range of organs account for a substantial proportion of the apparent effect of age on disease and hospital admissions. It supports a broader, multi-system approach to research and prevention of diseases of ageing.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014720v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014720v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Epidemiology

"Clinical validity of expanded carrier screening: evaluating the gene-disease relationship in more than 200 conditions","Objective: 
Clinical guidelines consider expanded carrier screening (ECS) to be an acceptable method of carrier screening. However, broader guideline support and payer adoption require evidence for associations between the genes on ECS panels and the conditions for which they aim to identify carriers. We applied a standardized framework for evaluation of gene-disease association to assess the clinical validity of conditions screened by ECS panels.   
Methods: 
The ClinGen gene curation framework was used to assess genetic and experimental evidence of associations between 208 genes and conditions screened on two commercial ECS panels. Twenty-one conditions were previously classified by ClinGen, and the remaining 187 were evaluated by curation teams at two laboratories. To ensure consistent application of the framework across the laboratories, concordance was evaluated on a subset of conditions. 
Results: 
All 208 evaluated conditions met the evidence threshold for supporting a gene-disease association. Furthermore, 203 of 208 (98%) achieved the strongest (Definitive) level of gene-disease association. All conditions evaluated by both commercial laboratories were similarly classified.  
Conclusion: 
Assessment using the ClinGen standardized framework revealed strong evidence of gene-disease association for conditions on two ECS panels. This result establishes the disease-level clinical validity of the panels considered herein.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014894v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014894v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Disease progression modeling in Alzheimer's disease: insights from the shape of cognitive decline","Background: The characterizing symptom of Alzheimer disease (AD) is cognitive deterioration. While much recent work has focused on defining AD as a biological construct, most patients are still diagnosed, staged, and treated based on their cognitive symptoms. But the cognitive capability of a patient at any time throughout this deterioration will not directly reflect the disease state, but rather the effect of the cognitive decline on the patient's predisease cognitive capability. Patients with high predisease cognitive capabilities tend to score better on cognitive tests relative to patients with low predisease cognitive capabilities at the same disease stage. Thus, a single assessment with a cognitive test is not adequate for determining the stage of an AD patient.
Methods and Findings: I developed a joint statistical model that explicitly modeled disease stage, baseline cognition, and the patients' individual changes in cognitive ability as latent variables. The developed model takes the form of a nonlinear mixed-effects model. Maximum-likelihood estimation in this model induces a data-driven criterion for separating disease progression and baseline cognition. Applied to data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the model estimated a timeline of cognitive decline in AD that spans approximately 15 years from the earliest subjective cognitive deficits to severe AD dementia. It was demonstrated how direct modeling of latent factors that modify the observed data patterns provide a scaffold for understanding disease progression, biomarkers and treatment effects along the continuous time progression of disease.
Conclusions: The suggested framework enables direct interpretations of factors that modify cognitive decline. The results give new insights to the value of biomarkers for staging patients and suggest alternative explanations for previous findings related to accelerated cognitive decline among highly educated patients and patients on symptomatic treatments.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014860v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014860v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Neurology

"Temporal trends in public mass shootings: high-capacity magazines significantly increase fatality counts, and are becoming more prevalent","Background: There has been disagreement in the literature regarding whether public mass shootings are becoming more frequent, or more deadly, and whether high-capacity magazine (HCM) weaponry is associated with increased fatalities.
Objective: We examined the 85 non-felony- and non-gang-related mass shootings with at least four people shot and killed that occurred in public places between 1995 to 2018 to examine the frequency and deadliness of public mass shootings, as well as the role of HCM weaponry in fatalities. 
Findings: The per-capita rate of public mass shootings with at least four people killed has not significantly increased since 1995 (Negative Binomial linear regression p=0.20), but public mass shootings with at least six people killed have been increasing by 6.9% per year (p=0.01). Public mass shootings are becoming significantly more deadly, with fatalities per incident increasing by 4.5% per year (truncated Negative Binomial log-linear regression p<0.001). 
Use of HCM weaponry banned during the 1994 to 2004 Federal Assault Weapons Ban (FAWB) increased fatality counts on average by 1.9 times, and total number shot by 3.3 times (non-parametric bootstrap comparison of means (NPBCM), p < 0.001 in both cases). In these incidents, HCM pistols were as deadly as assault rifles. The fraction of firearms involving HCMs used by perpetrators more than doubled after the lapse of the federal ban, from 25% during the ban to 59% after (Binomial factor regression, p<0.001).  
Our online visual analytics application, https://mass-shooting-analytics.shinyapps.io/mass_shootings/, allows interested parties to examine and download our data, replicate our analysis results and explore the analysis with alternate selections.
Policy recommendations: A re-instatement of the federal ban on high-capacity magazines in pistols and rifles, or special taxes on such weaponry, may reduce public mass shooting fatalities.

"Patient-derived ovarian cancer organoids mimic clinical response and exhibit heterogeneous inter- and intrapatient drug responses","Purpose - There remains an unmet need for preclinical models to enable personalized therapy for ovarian cancer (OC) patients. Recently, patient-derived organoid (PDO) cultures of patients with OC have been established that faithfully represent the histopathological features and genomic landscape of the patient tumor. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of OC PDOs to predict clinical drug response and functional consequences of tumor heterogeneity.
Experimental design - 36 genomically characterized PDOs from 23 patients with known clinical histories were exposed to chemotherapeutics and targeted drugs.
Results - OC PDOs maintained genomic features of the original tumor lesion and recapitulated patient response to neoadjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel combination treatment, according to distinct clinical outcomes (histopathological, biochemical and radiological). PDOs displayed inter- as well as intrapatient drug response heterogeneity, which could in part be explained by genetic aberrations. All PDOs were resistant to PARP-inhibitors, in accordance with homologous recombination pathway fidelity and genome-wide mutation context. KRAS, BRAF and NRAS mutation status predicted response to BRAF-inhibitor vemurafenib and pan-HER-inhibitor afatinib, and explained differential response among four PDOs derived from distinct tumor locations of an individual patient. Importantly, PDO drug screening identified sensitivity to at least one drug for the majority of patients (88%).
Conclusions - OC PDOs are a valuable preclinical model system that can provide insights in drug response for individual patients with OC, complementary to genetic testing. Generating PDOs of multiple tumor locations can  improve clinical decision making and increase our knowledge on genetic and drug response heterogeneity.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014712v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014712v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Oncology

"Post-Exertional Malaise in People with Chronic Cancer-Related Fatigue","Introduction: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a distressing and persistent sense of tiredness or exhaustion that interferes with usual functioning. Chronic CRF continues for months after curative cancer treatment is complete. Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is a worsening of symptoms after physical or mental activity, with limited investigations in people with chronic CRF. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe self-reported incidences of PEM in people with chronic CRF.
Methods: Participants (n=18) were eligible if they scored =34 on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale and had a cancer-related onset of fatigue. Participants completed a brief questionnaire to assess PEM over a 6-month time-frame (the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire - Post-Exertional Malaise; DSQ-PEM). In addition, a maximal exercise test was used to investigate self-reported symptom exacerbation (via an open-ended questionnaire) after strenuous physical exertion. 
Results: On the DSQ-PEM, three participants met objective scoring criteria, which included experiencing moderate to very severe symptoms at least half of the time, worsening of fatigue after minimal effort, plus a recovery duration of >24 h. Content analysis of responses to open-ended questionnaires identified five people who experienced a delayed recovery and symptoms of PEM after the exercise test.
Discussion: While only a minority (up to 29% in this sample) may experience PEM, exercise specialists and health care professionals working with people with chronic CRF must be aware that PEM may be an issue. Symptom exacerbation after exercise should be monitored, and exercise should be tailored and adapted to limit the potential for harm.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014829v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014829v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Oncology

"All-cause mortality and causes of death in the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study","Background & Aims: With the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA), mortality rates and causes of death among persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are likely to change over time. However, the emergence of such trends may be delayed by the relatively slow progression of chronic hepatitis C. To date, detailed analyses of cause-specific mortality among HCV-infected persons over time remain limited.

Methods: We evaluated changes in causes of death among the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS) participants, from 2008 to 2016. We analysed risk factors for all-cause and cause-specific mortality, accounting for changes in treatment, fibrosis stage and use of injectable drugs over time. Mortality ascertainment was completed by linking lost-to-follow-up participants to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (SFSO) death registry.

Results: We included 4,700 SCCS participants, of whom 478 died between 2008 and 2016. Linkage to the SFSO death registry substantially improved the information on causes of death (from 42% of deaths with unknown cause to 10% after linkage). Leading causes of death were liver failure (crude death rate 4.4/1000 person-years), liver cancer (3.4/1000 p-yrs) and non-liver cancer (2.8/1000 p-yrs), with an increasing proportion of cancer-related deaths over time. Cause-specific analysis showed that persons with sustained virologic response (SVR) were less at risk for liver-related mortality than those never treated or treated unsuccessfully.

Conclusions: Although the expected decrease in mortality is not yet observable, causes of death among HCV-infected persons evolved over time. With the progressive widening of guidelines for DAA use, liver-related mortality is expected to decline in the future. Continued monitoring of cause-specific mortality will remain important to assess the long-term effect of DAA and to design effective interventions.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014837v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014837v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Epidemiology

"A genome-wide association study of polycystic ovary syndrome identified from electronic health records","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Previous studies have identified genetic variants associated with PCOS identified by different diagnostic criteria. The Rotterdam Criteria is the broadest and able to identify the most PCOS cases. 
Objectives: To identify novel associated genetic variants, we extracted PCOS cases and controls from the electronic health records (EHR) based on the Rotterdam Criteria and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS). 
Study Design: We developed a PCOS phenotyping algorithm based on the Rotterdam criteria and applied it to three EHR-linked biobanks to identify cases and controls for genetic study. In discovery phase, we performed individual GWAS using the Geisinger's MyCode and the eMERGE cohorts, which were then meta-analyzed. We attempted validation of the significantly association loci (P<1x10-6) in the BioVU cohort. All association analyses used logistic regression, assuming an additive genetic model, and adjusted for principal components to control for population stratification. An inverse-variance fixed effect model was adopted for meta-analyses. Additionally, we examined the top variants to evaluate their associations with each criterion in the phenotyping algorithm. We used STRING to identify protein-protein interaction network.   
Results: We identified 2,995 PCOS cases and 53,599 controls in total (2,742 cases and 51,438 controls from the discovery phase; 253 cases and 2,161 controls in the validation phase). GWAS identified one novel genome-wide significant variant rs17186366 (OR=1.37 [1.23,1.54], P=2.8x10-8) located near SOD2. Additionally, two loci with suggestive association were also identified: rs113168128 (OR=1.72 [1.42,2.10], P=5.2 x10-8), an intronic variant of ERBB4 that is independent from the previously published variants, and rs144248326 (OR=2.13 [1.52,2.86], P=8.45x10-7), a novel intronic variant in WWTR1. In the further association tests of the top 3 SNPs with each criterion in the PCOS algorithm, we found that rs17186366 was associated with polycystic and hyperandrogenism, while rs11316812 and rs144248326 were mainly associated with oligomenorrhea or infertility. Besides ERBB4, we also validated the association with DENND1A1. 
Conclusion: Through a discovery-validation GWAS on PCOS cases and controls identified from EHR using an algorithm based on Rotterdam criteria, we identified and validated a novel association with variants within ERBB4. We also identified novel associations nearby SOD2 and WWTR1. These results suggest the eGFR and Hippo pathways in the disease etiology. With previously identified PCOS-associated loci YAP1, the ERBB4-YAP1-WWTR1 network implicates the epidermal growth factor receptor and the Hippo pathway in the multifactorial etiology of PCOS.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014761v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014761v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Integrated Bioinformatic Approach to Identify Potential Biomarkers against Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis","Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease that leads to gradual decline in lung function. The molecular mechanism and risk factors of this disease are still obscure. Poorly understood etiology of this disease is the major obstacle in the identification of potential biomarkers and drug targets. In this study, microarray gene expression data of normal and IPF patient has been utilized for the statistical analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a view to identifying potential molecular signatures using network-based system. Then their functional enrichment analysis revealed their predominant involvement in transcription, protein acetylation, extracellular matrix organization, apoptic process, inflammatory response etc. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network revealed (UBC, PTEN, SOS1, PTK2, FGFR1, YAP1, FOXO1, RACK1, BMP4 and CD44) as hub proteins in IPF. Subsequent regulatory network analysis suggested (E2F1, STAT3, PPARG, MEF2A, FOXC1, GATA3, YY1, GATA2, NFKB1, and FOXL1) as the best regulatory transcriptional signatures and (hsa-mir-155-5p, hsa-mir-16-5p, hsa-mir-17-5p, hsa-mir-19a-3p, hsa-mir-192-5p, hsa-mir-92a-3p, hsa-mir-26b-5p, hsa-mir-335-5p, hsa-mir-124-3p, and hsa-let-7b-5p) as the best post-transcriptional signatures. This study represents proteome and RNA signatures of IPF which might be useful to uphold the present efforts in the discovery of potential biomarkers and treatments of this disease.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014746v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014746v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Respiratory Medicine

"Retrospective Assessment of Deep Neural Networks for Skin Tumor Diagnosis","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to validate the performance of algorithm (http://rcnn.modelderm.com) for the diagnosis of benign and malignant skin tumors.
METHODS: With external validation dataset (43 disorders; 40,435 clinical images from 10,450 patients; January 1, 2008 - March 31, 2019), we compared the prediction of algorithm with the clinical diagnosis of 65 attending physicians at the time of biopsy request. 
RESULTS: For binary-task classification of determining malignancy, the AUC of the algorithm was 0.863(95% CI 0.852-0.875) with unprocessed clinical photographs. The sensitivity/specificity/positive predictive value/negative predictive value of the algorithm at the predefined high-sensitivity and high-specificity threshold were 79.1%(76.8-81.3)/77.0%(76.1-77.8)/31.3%(30.3-32.3)/96.5%(96.2-96.9) and 62.6%(59.9-65.2)/90.0%(89.4-90.6)/45.3%(43.5-47.2)/94.8%(94.4-95.1), respectively. The sensitivity/specificity calculated by the clinical diagnosis of attending physicians were 88.1%/83.8% (Top-3) and 70.2%/95.6% (Top-1), which were superior to the algorithm. For multi-task classification, the mean Top-1,2,3 accuracies of the algorithm were 42.620.7%, 56.122.8%, 61.922.9%, and those of clinical diagnosis were 65.417.7%, 73.916.6%, 74.716.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the algorithm was lower than that of dermatologists in real practice. Not only image information, but also clinical information should be integrated for more accurate prediction.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014647v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014647v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Dermatology

"Type 2 diabetes risks and determinants in 2nd generation migrants and mixed ethnicity people of South Asian and African Caribbean descent in the UK","Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk is markedly higher in UK South Asians (SA) and African Caribbeans (AC) compared to Europeans. Explanations for this excess are unclear. We therefore compared risks and determinants of T2DM in first- and second-generation (born in the UK) migrants, and in those of mixed ethnicity populations. 
Methods: Data from the UK Biobank, a large population-based cohort of volunteers aged 40-69, were used. T2DM was assigned using self-report and glycated haemoglobin. Ethnicity was self-assigned. Using logistic regression and mediation analysis, we compared T2DM between first- and second-generation migrants, and between mixed European/South Asians (MixESA), or mixed European/African Caribbeans (MixEAC) with both Europeans and SA or AC respectively. 
Results: T2DM prevalence was three to five times higher in SA and AC compared with Europeans [OR (95%CI): 4.80(3.60,6.40) and 3.30(2.70,4.10) respectively]. T2DM was 20-30% lower in second versus first generation SA and AC migrants [0.78(0.60,1.01) and 0.71(0.57,0.87) respectively]. T2DM in mixed populations was lower than comparator ethnic minority groups [MixESA versus SA 0.29(0.21,0.39), MixEAC versus AC 0.48(0.37,0.62)] and higher than Europeans, in MixESA 1.55(1.11, 2.17), and in MixEAC 2.06 (1.53, 2.78). Improved adiposity patterns in second generation migrants made an important contribution to risk reduction. Greater socioeconomic deprivation accounted for 17% and 42% of the excess risk of T2DM in MixESA and MixEAC compared to Europeans, respectively. 
Conclusion: Excess T2DM risks in South Asians and African Caribbeans compared with Europeans in the UK are attenuated by ~20% in second-generation migrants, demonstrating the marked benefits of favourable changes in environmental risk factors. T2DM prevalence in people of mixed ethnicity was also raised compared with Europeans, but considerably less than in the ethnic minority group; persistent socioeconomic disadvantage accounted for some of the residual excess.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014704v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014704v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"ULCERATIVE COLITIS-DERIVED COLONOID CULTURE: A Multi-Mineral-Approach to Improve Barrier Protein Expression","Background: Recent studies demonstrated that Aquamin, a calcium-, magnesium-, and multiple trace element-rich natural product, improves barrier structure and function in colonoids obtained from the tissue of healthy subjects.  The goal of the present study was to determine if the colonic barrier could be improved in tissue from subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC).  
Methods: Colonoid cultures were established with tissue from 9 individuals with UC.  The colonoids were then incubated for a 2-week period under control conditions (i.e., in culture medium with a final calcium concentration of 0.25 mM) or in the same medium supplemented with Aquamin to provide 1.5 - 4.5 mM calcium.  Effects on differentiation and barrier protein expression were determined using several approaches: phase-contrast & scanning electron microscopy, quantitative histology & immunohistology, mass spectrometry-based proteome assessment and transmission electron microscopy. 
Results: Aquamin-treated colonoids demonstrated a modest up-regulation of tight junctional proteins but stronger induction of adherens junction proteins and desmosomal proteins.  Increased desmosomes were seen at the ultrastructural level.  Proteomic analysis also demonstrated increased expression of basement membrane proteins and hemidesmosomal components.  Proteins expressed at the apical surface (mucins and trefoils) were also increased as were several additional proteins with anti-microbial activity or that modulate inflammation.  Conclusion: A majority of individuals including patients with UC do not reach the recommended daily intake for calcium and other minerals.  The findings presented here suggest that adequate mineral intake might improve the colonic barrier.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014662v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014662v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Gastroenterology

"Hepatitis C Core Antigen test as an alternative for diagnosing HCV infection: mathematical model and cost-effectiveness analysis","Background: The cost and complexity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is a significant barrier for the diagnosis and treatment of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). We investigated the cost-effectiveness of various testing strategies using antigen as an alternative to PCR.
Methods: We developed a mathematical model for HCV to estimate the number of newly diagnosed individuals and cases of different stages of liver disease. We compared the following testing strategies: antibody test followed by PCR in case of positive antibody (baseline strategy); antibody test followed by HCV-antigen test (antibody-antigen); antigen test alone; and PCR test alone. We conducted cost-effectiveness analyses considering the costs of HCV testing (of both infected and uninfected individuals) (A1), liver-related complications (A2) and all costs including HCV treatment (A3). The model was parameterized for the country of Georgia, and several sensitivity analyses were conducted to generalize the findings for different settings.
Results: Using the current standard of testing, 89% of infected individuals were detected. Comparatively, antibody-antigen and antigen testing alone detected 86% and 88% of infected individuals, respectively. PCR testing alone detected 91% of the infected individuals with the remaining 9% dying or spontaneously recovering before testing. In analysis A1, antibody-antigen testing was not found to be essentially cheaper compared to the baseline strategy. In analysis A2, strategies using PCR were cheaper than antigen-based strategies. In analysis A3, antibody-antigen testing was the cheapest strategy, followed by the baseline strategy, and PCR testing alone. 
Conclusion: Antigen testing, either following a positive antibody test or alone, performed almost as well as the current practice of HCV testing. The cost-effectiveness of these strategies strongly depends on the inclusion of treatment costs.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014621v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014621v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Epidemiology

"Evaluating the utility of tumour mutational signatures for identifying hereditary colorectal cancer and polyposis syndrome carriers","Objective: Germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes and the base excision repair genes NTHL1 and MUTYH underlie hereditary CRC and polyposis syndromes.  We evaluate the robustness and discriminatory potential of tumour mutational signatures in colorectal cancers (CRCs) for identifying germline PV carriers.
Design: Whole exome sequencing of FFPE CRC tissue was performed on hereditary CRC PV carriers (14 MMR, 6 biallelic MUTYH, and 1 biallelic NTHL1), 9 sporadic MMR-deficient CRCs (MMRd controls) and 18 sporadic MMR-proficient CRCs (MMRp controls).  COSMIC V3 Single Base Substitution (SBS) and Indel (ID) mutational signatures were calculated and assessed for their ability to differentiate CRCs that developed in carriers and non-carriers.
Results: The combination of SBS18 and SBS36 contributing >23% of the signature profile was able to discriminate biallelic MUTYH carriers from MMRp and MMRd control CRCs with >99% confidence.  Variant specific signatures SBS18 and SBS36 were identified for MUTYH p.Gly396Asp (p=0.015) and MUTYH p.Tyr179Cys (p=0.0012), respectively.  SBS30 was significantly increased in a CRC from a biallelic NTHL1 carrier compared with MMRp and MMRd control CRCs.  The combination of ID2, ID7, SBS15 and SBS1 could discriminate the 14 MMR PV carrier CRCs from the MMRp control CRCs, however, SBS and ID signatures, alone or in combination, could not provide complete discrimination between CRCs from MMR PV carriers and sporadic MMRd controls.  
Conclusion: Assessment of SBS and ID signatures can discriminate CRCs from MUTYH, NTHL1 and MMR PV carriers from non-carriers, demonstrating utility as a potential diagnostic and variant classification tool.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014597v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014597v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Oncology

"miRNA profiling in renal carcinoma suggest the existence of a group of pro-angionenic tumors in localized clear cell renal carcinoma","Renal cell carcinoma comprises a variety of entities, the most common being the clear-cell, papillary and chromophobe subtypes. These subtypes are related to different clinical evolution; however, most therapies have been developed for clear-cell carcinoma and there is not a specific treatment based on different subtypes. In this study, one hundred and sixty-four paraffin samples from primary nephrectomies for localized tumors were analyzed. MiRNAs were isolated and measured by microRNA arrays. Significance Analysis of Microarrays and Consensus Cluster algorithm were used to characterize different renal subtypes. The analyses showed that chromophobe renal tumors are a homogeneous group characterized by an overexpression of miR 1229, miR 10a, miR 182, miR 1208, miR 222, miR 221, miR 891b, miR 629-5p and miR 221-5p. On the other hand, clear cell renal carcinomas presented two different groups inside this histological subtype, with differences in miRNAs that regulate focal adhesion, transcription, apoptosis and angiogenesis processes. Specifically, one of the defined groups had an overexpression of proangiogenic microRNAs miR185, miR126 and miR130a.  In conclusion, differences in miRNA expression profiles between histological renal subtypes were established. In addition, clear cell renal carcinomas had different expression of proangiogenic miRNAs. With the emergence of antiangiogenic drugs, these differences could be used as therapeutic targets in the future or as a selection method for tailoring personalized treatments.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014696v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014696v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Oncology

"Brain-Computer Interface Robotics for Hand Rehabilitation After Stroke: A Systematic Review","Electroencephalography-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) that allow the control of robotic devices to support stroke patients during upper limb rehabilitation are increasingly popular. Hand rehabilitation is focused on improving dexterity and fine motor control and is a core approach for helping stroke survivors regain activities of daily living. This systematic review examines recent developments in BCI-robotic systems for hand rehabilitation and identifies evidence-based clinical studies on stroke patients. A search for January 2010-October 2019 articles using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore and Cochrane Library databases was performed. The selection criteria included BCI-hand robotic systems for rehabilitation in various development stages involving tests on healthy human subjects or stroke survivors. Data fields include those related to study design, participant characteristics, technical specifications of the system, and clinical outcome measures. 30 studies were identified as eligible for qualitative review and among these, 11 studies involved testing a BCI-hand robot on chronic and subacute stroke patients. Statistically significant improvements in motor assessment scores relative to controls were observed for two BCI-hand robot interventions. The degree of robot control for the majority of studies was limited to triggering the device to perform grasping or pinching movements using motor imagery. Most employed a combination of kinaesthetic and visual response via the robotic device and display screen, respectively, to match feedback to motor imagery.

"Minimal transmission in an influenza A (H3N2) human challenge-transmission model with exposure events in a controlled environment","Uncertainty about the relative importance of modes of influenza transmission, particularly airborne droplet nuclei (aerosols), fuels controversy concerning recommendations for healthcare worker protection during pandemics. In-depth review by an expert panel, a proof-of-concept study, and an international workshop concluded that human challenge-transmission studies in well-controlled environments would be the most promising approach to fill this critical knowledge gap. Healthy, seronegative volunteer Donors (n=52) were randomly selected for intranasal challenge with influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2). Seronegative Recipients randomized to Intervention (IR, n=40) or Control (CR, n=35) groups were exposed to Donors for four days. IRs wore face shields and hand sanitized frequently to limit large droplet and contact transmission. Intranasal inoculation produced an infection rate of 81% (42/52); 60% (25/42) of infected Donors had influenza-like illness, 14% (6/42) had fever, and 26% (11/42) had mild or no symptoms. Viral aerosol shedding was observed from 26% (11/42) of the infected Donors. One transmitted infection was confirmed by serology in a CR, yielding a SAR of 2.9% among CR, 0% in IR (p=0.47 for group difference), and 1.3% overall. The SAR observed was significantly less than 16% (p<0.001) expected based on the proof-of-concept study SAR considering that there were twice as many Donors and days of exposure. The main difference between these studies was mechanical building ventilation in the follow-on study, suggesting a possible role for aerosols. The low SAR suggests human challenge studies cannot provide definitive evidence regarding modes of transmission.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014381v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014381v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15",NA,"Nguyen-Van-Tam","/highwire/citation/70648/bibtext",18,"161219-18","16/12/2019","70648"
"Mendelian randomization analysis of smoking behavior and cognitive ability on the Big Five","Tobacco smoke, a mutagen that can thin the brain's cortex, might influence the Big Five (neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and openness). Cognitive ability, however, is a potential confounder, since it is associated with who smokes and with personality. Mendelian randomization (MR), which uses genetic variants as instrumental variables, can be used to probe the causal nature of these factors on personality. Here, MR was used to appraise smoking and cognitive ability on the Big Five and cognitive ability and neuroticism on social disparity. The results seem to suggest that smoking, independent of cognitive ability, leads people to be more neurotic and less extraverted and conscientious. Higher cognitive ability appears to make people less neurotic and more open, when accounting for smoking. Neuroticism appears to increase disparity, and higher cognitive ability appears to decrease it. Smoking may enhance disparity between those of lower and higher cognitive ability by exacerbating personality differences.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014530v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014530v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Epidemiology

"A brief report: de novo copy number variants in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","Background: Recent case-control genetic studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have implicated common and rare genetic risk alleles, highlighting the polygenic and complex aetiology of this neurodevelopmental disorder. Studies of other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Tourette disorder, developmental delay/intellectual disability, and schizophrenia indicate that identification of specific risk alleles and additional insights into disorder biology can be gained by studying non-inherited de novo variation. In this study, we aimed to identify large de novo copy number variants (CNVs) in children with ADHD. 
Methods: Children with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD and their parents were genotyped and included in this sample. We used PennCNV to call large (>200kb) CNVs and identified those calls that were present in the proband and absent in both biological parents. 
Results: In 305 parent-offspring trios, we detected 14 de novo CNVs in 13 probands, giving a mutation rate of 4.6% and a per individual rate of 4.3%. This rate is higher than published reports in controls and similar to those observed for ASD, schizophrenia and Tourette disorder. We also identified de novo mutations at 4 genomic loci (15q13.1-13.2 duplication, 16p13.11 duplication, 16p12.2 deletion and 22q11.21 duplication) that have previously been implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders, two of which (16p13.11 and 22q11.21) have also been implicated in case-control ADHD studies. 
Conclusions: Our study complements ADHD case-control genomic analyses and demonstrates the need for larger parent-offspring trio genetic studies to gain further insights into the complex aetiology of ADHD.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014555v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014555v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Mendelian randomization of smoking behavior on cognitive status among older Americans","Background: Smoking is a likely risk factor for dementia, and smoking behavior has a strong genetic component. In this study, we jointly test the associations between cumulative genetic risk for smoking, smoking behavior, and cognitive status using a Mendelian randomization framework.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using the 2010 wave of the Health and Retirement Study database. Individuals aged between 50 and 90 were included. Smoking status was self-reported. Polygenic scores (PGSs) were calculated by weighting participant genotype by published smoking genome-wide association estimates. Cognitive status (normal, impaired, dementia) was measured using multiple assessments. A Mendelian randomization framework was used to infer causal relationships between smoking behavior and cognitive status via genetic instruments.
Results: Among European ancestry participants (N = 8,735), current smoking behavior was positively associated with cognitive impairment (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.29, 2.01) relative to normal cognition. Using smoking PGS as an instrumental variable, a causal relationship was observed between current smoking and cognitive impairment (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.18). There were no associations between smoking PGS, smoking behaviors and cognitive status in the African ancestry study sample (N = 2,511). 
Conclusions: Current smoking is a modifiable risk factor which causes cognitive impairment. Promotion of smoking cessation is important for public health. Further studies on dose and duration of smoking behaviors on cognitive impairment are critically needed, as well as in research other ancestries.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014522v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014522v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Epidemiology

"Determining factors for pertussis vaccination policy: A study in 5 EU countries","Pertussis vaccination policy varies across Europe, not only in the type of vaccine (whole cell (wP) vs. acellular (aP1/2/3/5)) but also in the schedule and recommendation for parents. This study aims to investigate the determining factors for the type of vaccine, immunization schedule and maternal immunization recommendation. From March to May 2019, experts in national health agencies and major academic or research institutions from Denmark, France, Poland, Sweden and the UK were invited to a semi-structured interview. Thematic analysis was performed on the transcripts using a codebook formulated by 3 coders. Inter-coder agreement was assessed. Fifteen expert interviews were conducted. The identified driving factors for pertussis vaccine policy were classified into three domains: scientific factors, sociological factors, and pragmatic factors. The determining factors for the type of vaccine were prescriber preference, concern of adverse events following immunization (AEFI), effectiveness, and consideration of other vaccine components in combined vaccines. The determining factors for infant schedule were immunity response and the potential to improve coverage and timeliness. The determining factors for maternal immunization were infant mortality and public acceptability. To conclude, socio-political and pragmatic factors were, besides scientific factors, important in determining the vaccine type, schedule of childhood immunization and recommendations for parents.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014449v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014449v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Health Policy

"Genetically predicted serum urate, blood pressure and cardiovascular disease: an updated Mendelian randomization investigation","Background: Elevated serum urate has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but it is not known whether this relationship is causal, non-linear or sex-specific. Basic science and clinical trial data have supported an effect of serum urate on systolic blood pressure (SBP), which may in turn mediate an effect on CVD risk.

Methods: Using recently available data from the Million Veterans Program and UK Biobank, we applied improved genetic instruments for serum urate in one and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to investigate for effects on risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), and stroke. Potential mediation through SBP was explored, as well as evidence of non-linear and sex-specific effects. We performed a number of sensitivity analyses using different MR methodologies and populations to investigate consistency of our findings.
 
Results: Higher genetically predicted serum urate was associated with an increased risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR] per 1-standard deviation increase in genetically predicted urate 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.30, P=4x10-5), PAD (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.21, P=9x10-3), and stroke (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.18, P=2x10-4). Similar estimates were produced when applying MR methods that make distinct assumptions, or when considering different populations. SBP was estimated to mediate 29%, 44% and 45% of the effect of urate on CHD, PAD and stroke respectively. There was no evidence of non-linear or sex-specific effects of genetically predicted urate on CVD risk.

Conclusions: Using contemporary data and MR methods, we provide support for an effect of serum urate on CVD risk that may partly be mediated through SBP. High-quality trials are necessary to provide definitive evidence on the cardiovascular benefit of urate lowering.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014472v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19014472v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma biomarkers in individuals at risk for genetic prion disease","BACKGROUND: Fluid biomarkers are important in the development of therapeutics to delay or prevent prion disease, but have not been systematically evaluated in pre-symptomatic individuals at risk for genetic prion disease.

METHODS: We recruited pre-symptomatic individuals with pathogenic mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP; N=27) and matched controls (N=16), to donate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood at multiple timepoints to a cohort study at Massachusetts General Hospital. We quantified total prion protein (PrP) and real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) prion seeding activity in CSF, and the neuronal damage markers total tau (T-tau) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in both CSF and plasma. We compared these markers cross-sectionally between mutation carriers and controls, evaluated short-term test-retest reliability over 2-4 months, and conducted a pilot longitudinal study over 10-20 months for a subset of participants.

FINDINGS: CSF PrP levels were stable on test-retest with a mean coefficient of variation of 7% both over 2-4 months in N=29 participants and over 10-20 months in N=10 participants. RT-QuIC was negative in 22/23 mutation carriers. The sole individual with positive RT-QuIC seeding activity at two study visits had steady CSF PrP levels and slightly increased tau and NfL concentrations compared with others, though still within the normal range, and remained asymptomatic one year later. Overall, tau and NfL showed no significant differences between mutation carriers and controls in either CSF or plasma.

INTERPRETATION: CSF PrP will be interpretable as a pharmacodynamic readout of the effects of a PrP-lowering therapeutic in pre-symptomatic individuals, and may serve as a surrogate biomarker in a ""primary prevention"" trial paradigm. In contrast, current markers of prion seeding activity and of neuronal damage do not reliably cross-sectionally distinguish mutation carriers from controls, arguing against the feasibility of a ""secondary prevention"" paradigm in which trials specifically recruit pre-symptomatic participants with prodromal evidence of pathology.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014217v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014217v1.full.pdf","2019-12-15","Neurology

"Clustering of susceptible individuals within households can drive measles outbreaks: an individual-based model exploration","When estimating important measures such as the herd immunity threshold, and the corresponding efforts required to eliminate measles, it is often assumed that susceptible individuals are uniformly distributed throughout populations. However, unvaccinated individuals may be clustered in a variety of ways, including by geographic location, by age, in schools, or in households. Here, we investigate to which extent different levels of within-household clustering of susceptible individuals may impact the risk and persistence of measles outbreaks. To this end, we apply an individual-based model, Stride, to a population of 600,000 individuals, using data from Flanders, Belgium. We compare realistic scenarios regarding the distribution of susceptible individuals within households in terms of their impact on epidemiological measures for outbreak risk and persistence. We find that higher levels of within-household clustering of susceptible individuals increase the risk, size and persistence of measles outbreaks. Ignoring within-household clustering thus leads to underestimations of measles elimination and outbreak mitigation efforts.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014282v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014282v2.full.pdf","2019-12-16","Epidemiology

"Using collaboration networks to identify authorship bias in meta-analyses","Meta-analytic methods are powerful resources to summarize the existing evidence concerning a given research question, and are widely used in many academic fields. However, meta-analyses can be vulnerable to various sources of bias, which should be considered to avoid inaccuracies. Many of these sources can be related to study authorship, as both methodological choices and researcher bias may lead to deviations in results between different research groups. In this work, we describe a method to objectively attribute study authorship within a given meta-analysis to different research groups by using graph cluster analysis of collaboration networks. We then provide empirical examples of how the research group of origin can impact effect size in distinct types of meta-analyses, demonstrating how non-independence between within-group results can bias effect size estimates if uncorrected. Finally, we show that multilevel random-effects models using research group as a level of analysis can be a simple tool for correcting biases related to study authorship.","/content/10.1101/19001305v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001305v2.full.pdf","2019-12-16","Epidemiology

"NeuroMark: a fully automated ICA method to identify effective fMRI markers of brain disorders","Increasing sharing initiatives on neuroimaging data have provided unprecedented opportunities to study brain disorders. Standardized approaches for capturing reproducible and comparable biomarkers are greatly needed. Here, we propose a method, NeuroMark, which leverages a priori-driven independent component analysis to effectively extract functional brain network biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. NeuroMark automatically estimates features adaptable to each individual and comparable across subjects by taking advantage of the replicated brain network templates extracted from 1828 healthy controls as guidance to initialize the individual-level networks. Four studies including 2454 subjects were conducted spanning six brain disorders (schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease) to evaluate the proposed method from different perspectives (replication, cross-study comparison, subtle difference identification, and multi-disorder classification). Results demonstrate the great potential of NeuroMark in its feasibility to link different datasets/studies/disorders and enhance sensitivity in identifying biomarkers for patients with challenging mental illnesses.","/content/10.1101/19008631v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008631v2.full.pdf","2019-12-16","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Automated interpretation of the coronary angioscopy with deep convolutional neural networks","Background: Coronary angioscopy (CAS) is a useful modality to assess atherosclerotic changes, but interpretation of the images requires expert knowledge. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) can be used for diagnostic prediction and image synthesis.
Methods: 107 images from 47 patients, who underwent coronary angioscopy in our hospital between 2014 and 2017, and 864 images, selected from 142 MEDLINE-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2019, were analyzed. First, we developed a prediction model for the angioscopic findings. Next, we made a generative adversarial networks (GAN) model to simulate the CAS images. Finally, we tried to control the output images according to the angioscopic findings with conditional GAN architecture.
Results: For both yellow color (YC) grade and neointimal coverage (NC) grade, we could observe strong correlations between the true grades and the predicted values (YC grade, average r value = 0.80  0.02, p-value <0.001; NC grade, average r value = 0.73  0.02, p < 0.001). The binary classification model for the red thrombus yielded 0.71  0.03 F1- score and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.91  0.02. The standard GAN model could generate realistic CAS images (average Inception score = 3.57  0.06). GAN-based data augmentation improved the performance of the prediction models. In the conditional GAN model, there were significant correlations between given values and expert's diagnosis in YC grade but not in NC grade.
Conclusion: DCNN is useful in both predictive and generative modeling that can help develop the diagnostic support system for CAS.","/content/10.1101/19001693v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001693v2.full.pdf","2019-12-17","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Mapping Psilocybin-Assisted Therapies: A Scoping Review","We conducted a scoping review on psilocybin-assisted therapy for addiction, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Psilocybin is a naturally-occurring tryptophan derivative found in species of mushroom with psycho-active properties. From 2022 records identified by database searching, 40 publications were included in the qualitative synthesis from which we identified 9 clinical trials with a total of 169 participants. Trials used a peak-psychedelic model of therapy, emphasizing inward journey through the use of eyeshades, set musical scores and with medium to high doses of psilocybin. No serious adverse effects were reported; mild adverse effects included transient anxiety, nausea and post-treatment headaches. Overall, the 9 trials all demonstrated safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in the treatments of obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder, treatment-resistant unipolar depression, anxiety or depression in patients with life-threatening cancer and demoralization among long-term AIDS survivors.The literature was found to be early and exploratory, with several limitations: only 5 were randomized controlled trials, small and homogenous patient sample size, difficulties in blinding, and the confounding influence of psychological supports provided. Further research is indicated to establish effectiveness for these and other indications, with a more diverse range of patients, and with differing program and dosing modalities.

"Application of a severity framework to 176 genes on an expanded carrier screening panel","Background
Disease severity is considered to be an important factor for inclusion of diseases on expanded carrier screening (ECS) panels. Evaluating severity requires an objective, systematic method. Here, we applied a validated algorithm that objectively categorizes disease severity into one of four categories-profound, severe, moderate, and mild-to 176 genes on a clinically available ECS panel. 
Methods
Eight genetic counselors (GCs) working in pairs, followed by four medical geneticists (MDs) working in pairs, applied the algorithm to subsets of the 176 genes. 
Results
Upon initial GC and MD review, 107/176 genes (61%) and 133/176 genes (76%), respectively, had concordant classifications, with consensus reached for all genes after collaborative review. Final severity classifications were 68 (39%) profound, 71 (40%) severe, 36 (20%) moderate, and one (1%) mild. No classification biases were detected within the GC or MD pairs. 
Conclusion
This study illustrates an approach to severity classification for large sets of Mendelian genes. The observed level of initial discordance demonstrates the complexity of severity and underscores the importance of collaboration involving multiple clinicians. Severity classification, in addition to other factors suggested by ACOG, is an important factor for laboratories to consider as they aim to design clinically valid ECS panels.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014951v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014951v1.full.pdf","2019-12-18",NA,"Arjunan","/highwire/citation/70740/bibtext",1,"191219-1","19/12/2019","70740"
"Interactive web application for plotting personalized prognosis prediction curves in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using machine learning","Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a curative treatment option for malignant hematological disorders. Transplant clinicians estimate patient-specific prognosis empirically in clinical practice based on previous studies on similar patients. However, this approach does not provide objective data. The present study primarily aimed to develop a tool capable of providing accurate personalized prognosis prediction after allo-HCT in an objective manner. We succeeded in generating personalized prognosis prediction curves of 1-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) adjusted for new allo-HCT candidates by eight pre-transplant factors using our interactive web application (https://predicted-os-after-transplantation.shinyapps.io/RSF_model/). A random survival forest model using the data of patients who underwent allo-HCT at our institution was applied to develop this application. To assess its predictive performance, the entire cohort (363 cases) was split into a training cohort (70%) to develop the predictive model and test cohort (30%) to confirm its performance time-sequentially. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for 1-year OS, PFS, relapse/progression, and NRM in test cohort were 0.70, 0.72, 0.73, and 0.77, respectively. In conclusion, the new web application could allow transplant clinicians to inform a new allo-HCT candidate of the objective personalized prognosis prediction and facilitate decision-making.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014654v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014654v1.full.pdf","2019-12-18",NA,"Okamura","/highwire/citation/70739/bibtext",2,"191219-2","19/12/2019","70739"
"Quantifying and characterizing hourly human exposure to malaria vectors bites in rural southwest Burkina Faso","Background: To sustain the efficacy of malaria vector control, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the combination of effective tools. Before designing and implementing additional strategies in any setting, it is critical to monitor or predict when and where transmission occurs. However, to date, very few studies have quantified the behavioural interactions between humans and Anopheles vectors. Here, we characterized residual transmission in a rural area of Burkina Faso where long lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) are widely used.
Methods: We analysed data on both human and malaria vectors behaviours from 27 villages to measure hourly human exposure to vector bites in dry and rainy seasons using mathematical models. We estimated the protective efficacy of LLINs and characterised where (indoors vs. outdoors) and when both LLIN users and non-users were exposed to vector bites.
Results: The percentage of the population who declared sleeping under a LLIN the previous night was very high regardless of the season, with an average LLIN use ranging from 92.43% to 99.89%. The use of LLIN provided > 80% protection against exposure to vector bites. The proportion of exposure for LLIN users was 29-57% after 05:00 and 0.05-12 % before 20:00. More than 80% of exposure occurred indoors for LLIN users and the estimate reached 90% for children under five years old in the dry cold season.
Conclusions: This study supports the current use of LLIN as a primary malaria vector control tool. It also emphasises the need to complement LLIN with indoor-implemented measures such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) and/or house improvement to effectively combat malaria in the rural area of Diebougou. Furthermore, malaria elimination programmes would also require strategies that target outdoor biting vectors to be successful in the area.

"At what geographic scales does agricultural alienation amplify foodborne disease outbreaks? A statistical test for 25 U.S. states, 1970-2000","The modern economy is driving multiple environmental and social crises across the globe. Capital
accumulation externalizes the myriad damage associated with commodity production to ecosystems,
labor, public health, and governments across jurisdictions. A growing literature shows multinational agriculture, a major sector of the economy, is playing a fundamental role in disrupting the ecological cycles upon which communities across the globe depend. We report here one of the first statistical tests of such an ecosocial rift. We use geometric morphometrics to characterize a parameter space in agricultural alienation across nature, human welfare, and industrial appropriation for 25 U.S. states, at five year increments between 1970-2000. The two first relative warps of the analysis reproduce the long-documented shift in and out of the 1980s farming crisis. We find the crisis left the U.S. food system in a new configuration, with commodity crops replacing cropland pasture, greater farm debt load, overcapitalized inputs, and a relative decline in on-farm wages. To determine if such a shift had an epidemiological impact, we further tested whether salmonellosis and shigellosis - two foodborne pathogens for which national incidence data across the study period were available - regressed against historical changes in this alienation space across geographic scale. The second relative warp for shigellosis showed a multivariate relationship with the alienation space, but significance failed to withstand a Bonferroni correction. The partial warps and Procrustes residuals of temporal trends in the alienation
space likewise exhibited limited predictive capacity for outbreak size. These results may, in part, reflect sampling artifacts. Data availability limits both the number of years sampled and the variety of diseases tested, constraining statistical power. Nevertheless, our analyses demonstrate that metabolic rifts associated with specific modes of production can be rigorously investigated.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014910v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014910v1.full.pdf","2019-12-18",NA,"Okamoto","/highwire/citation/70737/bibtext",4,"191219-4","19/12/2019","70737"

Here, we assessed metacognitive performance by asking individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (N=20) and matched healthy participants (N = 21) to perform a visual discrimination task and subsequently report confidence in their performance. Metacognitive performance was defined as the adequacy between visual discrimination performance and confidence. Bayesian analyses revealed equivalent metacognitive performance in the two groups despite a weaker association between confidence and trajectory tracking during task execution among patients. These results were reproduced using a bounded evidence accumulation model which showed similar decisional processes in the two groups. The inability to accurately attune confidence to perceptual decisions in schizophrenia remains to be experimentally demonstrated, along with the way such impairments may underpin functional deficits.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.15.19014969v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.15.19014969v1.full.pdf","2019-12-18",NA,"Faivre","/highwire/citation/70736/bibtext",5,"191219-5","19/12/2019","70736"
"Stochastic challenges to interrupting helminth transmission","Predicting the effect of different programmes designed to control both the morbidity induced by helminth infections and parasite transmission is greatly facilitated by the use of mathematical models of transmission and control impact. In such models, it is essential to account for as many sources of uncertainty -- natural, or otherwise -- to ensure robustness in prediction and to accurately depict variation around an expected outcome. In this paper, we investigate how well the standard deterministic models match the predictions made using individual-based stochastic simulations. We also explore how well concepts which derive from deterministic models, such as breakpoints in transmission, apply in the stochastic world. Employing an individual based stochastic model framework we also investigate how transmission and control are affected by the migration of infected people into a defined community. To give our study focus we consider the control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) by mass drug administration (MDA), though our methodology is readily applicable to the other helminth species such as the schistosome parasites and the filarial worms. We show it is possible to define a stochastic breakpoint where much noise surrounds the expected deterministic breakpoint. We also discuss the concept of the interruption of transmission independent of the breakpoint concept where analyses of model behaviour illustrate the current limitations of deterministic models to account for the fade-out or transmission extinction behaviour in simulations. The analyses based on migration confirm a relationship between the infected human migration rate per unit of time and the death rate of infective stages that are released into the free-living environment (eggs or larvae depending on the STH species) that create the reservoir of infection which in turn determines the likelihood that control activities aim at chemotherapeutic treatment of the human host will eliminate transmission. The development of a new stochastic simulation code for STH in the form of a publicly-available open-source python package which includes features to incorporate many population stratifications, different control interventions including mass drug administration (with defined frequency, coverage levels and compliance patterns) and inter-village human migration is also described.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.17.19013490v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.17.19013490v1.full.pdf","2019-12-18",NA,"Hardwick","/highwire/citation/70735/bibtext",6,"191219-6","19/12/2019","70735"
"Development of a Mixture Model (SMM) Allowing for Smoothing Functions of Trajectories","In the health and social sciences, two types of mixture model have been widely used by researchers to identify heterogeneous trajectories of participants within a population: latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and the growth mixture model (GMM). Both methods parametrically model trajectories of individuals, and capture latent trajectory classes, by using an expectation-maximization (E-M) algorithm. However, parametric modeling of trajectories using polynomial functions or monotonic spline functions results in limited flexibility for modelling trajectories; as a result, group membership may not be classified accurately due to model misspecification. In this paper, we propose a mixture model (SMM) allowing for smoothing functions of trajectories using a modified E-M algorithm. In the E step, participants are reassigned to only one group for which the estimated trajectory is the most similar to the observed one; in the M step, trajectories are fitted using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) with smoothing functions of time. This modified E-M algorithm is straightforward to implement using the recently released gamm4 macro in R. The SMM can incorporate time-varying covariates and be applied to longitudinal data with normal, Bernoulli, and Poisson distributions. Simulation results show favorable performance of the SMM in terms of classification of group membership. The proposed method is illustrated by its application to body mass index data of individuals followed from adolescence to young adulthood and the relationship with incidence of cardiometabolic disease.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014928v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014928v1.full.pdf","2019-12-18",NA,"Ding","/highwire/citation/70734/bibtext",7,"191219-7","19/12/2019","70734"
"A Systematic Review on Psychological and Biological Mediators Between Adversity and Psychosis: Potential Targets for Treatment","Background:
Various psychological and biological pathways have been proposed as mediators between childhood adverse events (CA) and psychosis. A systematic review of the evidence in this domain is needed.

Aims: 
Systematically review the evidence on clinical and biological mediators between CA and psychosis across the psychosis spectrum.

Methods
This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Articles published between 1979 and July 2019 were identified through a literature search in OVID (PsychINFO; Medline and Embase). The direction of the evidence by each analysis and each study results were presented by group of mediator categories found in the review; the percentage of total effect mediated was calculated.

Results
47 studies were included, with a total of 79,668  general population (GP) subjects and 3,189 from clinical samples. The quality of studies was judged as 'fair'. We found (i) solid evidence of mediation between CA and psychosis by negative cognitive schemas about the self, the world and others (NS); by dissociation and other PTSD symptoms; (ii) evidence of a partial mediation through an affective pathway (affective dysregulation, anxiety and depression) in GP; (iii)  lack of studies exploring biological mediators. 

Conclusions
Experiences of adversity, along with relevant mediators such as PTSD and mood related symptoms and NS should be routinely assessed in patients with psychosis. Targeting such mediators through cognitive behavioural aproaches using trauma-focused therapy and/or pharmacological means could be a useful addition to the traditional treatment of positive symptoms.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014506v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014506v1.full.pdf","2019-12-18",NA,"Alameda","/highwire/citation/70733/bibtext",8,"191219-8","19/12/2019","70733"
"Educational attainment reduces the risk of suicide attempt among individuals with and without psychiatric disorders independent of cognition: a multivariable Mendelian randomization study with more than 815,000 participants","Background: Rates of suicidal ideation, attempts and completions are increasing and identifying causal risk factors continues to be a public health priority. Observational literature has shown that educational attainment (EA) and cognitive performance (CP) can influence suicide attempt risk; however, due to residual confounding and reverse causation, the causal nature of these relationships is unknown.   
Methods: We perform a multivariable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to disentangle the effects of EA and CP on suicide attempt risk. We use summary statistics from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of EA, CP, household income versus suicide attempt risk in individuals with and without mental disorders, with more than 815,000 combined study participants. 
Results: We found evidence that both EA and CP significantly reduced the risk of suicide attempt when considered separately in single variable MR (SVMR) (Model 1 EA odds ratio (OR), 0.524, 95% CI, 0.412-0.666, P = 1.07x10-7; CP OR, 0.714, 95% CI, 0.577-0.885, P = 0.002). When simultaneously analyzing EA, CA, and adjusting for household income but not comorbid mental disorders (Model 1), we found evidence that the direct effect of EA, independent of CP, on suicide attempt risk was greater than the total effect estimated by SVMR, with EA, independent of CP, significantly reducing the risk of suicide attempt by almost 66% (95% CI, 43%-79%); however, the effect of CP was no longer significant independent of EA (Model 1 EA OR, 0.342, 95% CI, 0.206-0.568, P = 1.61x10-4; CP OR, 1.182, 95% CI, 0.842-1.659, P = 0.333). Further, when accounting for comorbid mental disorders (Model 2), these results did not significantly change: we found EA significantly reduced the risk of suicide attempt by 55% (35%-68%), a lower point estimate but still within the 95% confidence interval of Model 1; the effect of CP was still not significant (Model 2 EA OR, 0.450, 95% CI, 0.314-0.644, P < 1.00x10-4; CP OR, 1.143, 95% CI, 0.803-1.627, P = 0.475).
Conclusions: Our results show that even after accounting for comorbid mental disorders and adjusting for household income, EA, but not CP, is a causal risk factor in suicide attempt. These findings could have important implications for health policy and prevention programs aimed at reducing the increasing rates of suicide.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014787v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014787v1.full.pdf","2019-12-18",NA,"Rosoff","/highwire/citation/70732/bibtext",9,"191219-9","19/12/2019","70732"
"Cortical thickness and formal thought disorder in schizophrenia: An ultra high-field network-based morphometry study","Background: Persistent formal thought disorder (FTD) is a core feature of schizophrenia. Recent cognitive and neuroimaging studies indicate a distinct mechanistic pathway underlying the persistent positive FTD (pFTD or disorganized thinking), though its structural determinants are still elusive. Using network-based cortical thickness estimates from ultra-high field 7-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (7T MRI), we investigated the structural correlates of pFTD.
Methods: We obtained speech samples and 7T MRI anatomical scans from medicated clinically stable patients with schizophrenia (n=19) and healthy controls (n=20). Network-based morphometry was used to estimate the mean cortical thickness of 17 functional networks covering the entire cortical surface from each subject. We also quantified the vertexwise variability of thickness within each network to quantify the spatial coherence of the 17 networks, estimated patients vs. controls differences, and related the thickness of the affected networks to the severity of pFTD. 
Results: Patients had reduced thickness of the frontoparietal and default mode networks, and reduced spatial coherence affecting the salience and the frontoparietal control network. A higher burden of positive FTD related to reduced frontoparietal thickness and reduced spatial coherence of the salience network. The presence of positive FTD, but not its severity, related to the reduced thickness of the language network comprising of the superior temporal cortex.
Conclusions: These results suggest that cortical thickness of both cognitive control and language networks underlie the positive FTD in schizophrenia. The structural integrity of cognitive control networks is a critical determinant of the expressed severity of persistent FTD in schizophrenia.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.17.19014415v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.17.19014415v1.full.pdf","2019-12-18",NA,"Palaniyappan","/highwire/citation/70723/bibtext",10,"191219-10","19/12/2019","70723"
"Dose-response relationship between physical activity and mortality in adults with noncommunicable diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies","Objective
To investigate the relationship between post-diagnosis physical activity and mortality in patients with selected noncommunicable diseases, including breast cancer, lung cancer, type 2 diabetes (T2D), ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, osteoarthritis, low back pain and major depressive disorders.
Design
Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.
Data sources
PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science were searched systematically for English publications from the inception of the platforms until August 2018. Additionally, the search was updated in August 2019.
Eligibility criteria
Prospective observational studies examining the relationship between at least three physical activity categories and all-cause mortality or disease-specific mortality as the primary outcome. 
Results
In total, 28 studies were included: 12 for breast cancer, 6 for T2D, 8 for IHD and 2 for COPD. The linear meta-analysis revealed that each 10 metabolic equivalent tasks (MET) h increase of physical activity per week was associated with a 22% lower mortality rate in breast cancer patients (Hazard Ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.86), 12% in IHD patients (HR, 0.88; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.93), 30% in COPD patients (HR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.45, 1.09) and 4% in T2D patients (HR, 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). The non-linear meta-analysis showed a regressive association with no threshold for the beneficial effect of physical activity on mortality. 
Conclusion
Higher levels of post-diagnosis physical activity are associated with lower mortality rates in breast cancer, T2D, IHD and COPD patients, with evidence of a no-threshold and non-linear dose-response pattern.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19014340v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19014340v1.full.pdf","2019-12-18",NA,"Geidl","/highwire/citation/70718/bibtext",11,"191219-11","19/12/2019","70718"
"Identifying Acute Low Back Pain Episodes in Primary Care Practice from Clinical Notes","Acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) are different conditions with different treatments. However, they are coded in electronic health records with the same ICD-10 code (M54.5) and can be differentiated only by retrospective chart reviews. This prevents efficient definition of data driven guidelines for billing and therapy recommendations, such as return to-work options. To solve this issue, we evaluate the feasibility of automatically distinguishing acute LBP episodes by analyzing free text clinical notes. We used a dataset of 17,409 clinical notes from different primary care practices; of these, 891 documents were manually annotated as ""acute LBP"" and 2,973 were generally associated with LBP via the recorded ICD-10 code. We compared different supervised and unsupervised strategies for automated identification: keyword search; topic modeling; logistic regression with bag-of-n-grams and manual features; and deep learning (ConvNet). We trained the supervised models using either manual annotations or ICD-10 codes as positive labels. ConvNet trained using manual annotations obtained the best results with an AUC-ROC of 0.97 and F-score of 0.72. ConvNet's results were also robust to reduction of the number of manually annotated documents. In the absence of manual annotations, topic models performed better than methods trained using ICD-10 codes, which were unsatisfactory for identifying LBP acuity. This study uses clinical notes to delineate a potential path toward systematic learning of therapeutic strategies, billing guidelines, and management options for acute LBP at the point of care.","/content/10.1101/19010462v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010462v3.full.pdf","2019-12-18","Health Informatics

"Spinal muscular atrophy diagnosis and carrier screening from whole-genome sequencing data","Purpose
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), caused by loss of the SMN1 gene, is a leading cause of early childhood death. Due to the near identical sequences of SMN1 and SMN2, analysis of this region is challenging. Population-wide SMA screening to quantify the SMN1 copy number (CN) is recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics. 
Methods
We developed a method that accurately identifies the CN of SMN1 and SMN2 using genome sequencing (GS) data by analyzing read depth and eight informative reference genome differences between SMN1/2.
Results
We characterized SMN1/2 in 12,747 genomes, identified 1568 samples with SMN1 gains or losses and 6615 samples with SMN2 gains or losses and calculated a pan-ethnic carrier frequency of 2%, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, 99.8% of our SMN1 and 99.7% of SMN2 CN calls agreed with orthogonal methods, with a recall of 100% for SMA and 97.8% for carriers, and a precision of 100% for both SMA and carriers.
Conclusion
This SMN copy number caller can be used to identify both carrier and affected status of SMA, enabling SMA testing to be offered as a comprehensive test in neonatal care and an accurate carrier screening tool in GS sequencing projects.","/content/10.1101/19006635v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006635v2.full.pdf","2019-12-18","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Treatment advantage in HBV/HIV coinfection compared to HBV monoinfection in a South African cohort","Objective: Prompted by international targets for elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, we performed a cross-sectional observational study of adults with chronic HBV (CHB) infection in South Africa, characterising individuals with HBV monoinfection vs. those coinfected with HBV/HIV, to evaluate the impact of therapy and to guide improvements in clinical care as guidelines for antiviral therapy change over time.
Design: We prospectively recruited 115 adults with CHB, over a period of one year at a university hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. HIV coinfection was present in 39 (34%) subjects. We recorded cross-sectional demographic, clinical and laboratory data.
Results: Adults with HBV monoinfection were comparable to those with HBV/HIV coinfection in terms of age, sex and body mass. HBeAg-positive status was more common among those with HIV coinfection (p=0.01). However, compared to HBV/HIV coinfection, HBV monoinfected patients were less likely to have had assessment with elastography (p<0.0001) and less likely to be on antiviral treatment (p<0.0001). The HBV monoinfected group was more likely to have detectable HBV viraemia (p=0.04), and features suggesting underlying liver disease including moderate/severe thrombocytopaenia (p=0.007), elevated bilirubin (p=0.004), and APRI score >2 (p=0.02). Three cases of hepatocellular carcinoma were documented, all in patients with HBV monoinfection.
Conclusion: In this setting, individuals with HBV monoinfection are disadvantaged in terms of clinical assessment and appropriate antiviral therapy compared to those with HIV coinfection, associated with relatively worse liver health. Enhanced advocacy, education, resources and infrastructure are required to optimise interventions for CHB.","/content/10.1101/19007963v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007963v2.full.pdf","2019-12-19","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Identification of Familial Hodgkin Lymphoma Predisposing Genes Using Whole Genome Sequencing","Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoproliferative malignancy of B-cell origin that accounts for 10% of all lymphomas. Despite evidence suggesting strong familial clustering of HL, there is no clear understanding of the contribution of genes predisposing to HL. In this study, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 7 affected and 9 unaffected family members from three HL-prone families and variants were prioritized using our Familial Cancer Variant Prioritization Pipeline (FCVPPv2). WGS identified a total of 98564, 170550 and 113654 variants which were reduced by pedigree-based filtering to 18158, 465 and 26465 in families I, II and III, respectively. In addition to variants affecting amino acid sequences, variants in promoters, enhancers, transcription factors binding sites and microRNA seed sequences were identified from upstream, downstream, 5 and 3 prime untranslated regions. A panel of 565 cancer predisposing and other cancer-related genes and of 2383 high-risk HL genes were also screened in these families to aid further prioritization. Pathway analysis of segregating genes with CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion Tool) scores > 20 was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software which implicated several candidate genes in pathways involved in B-cell activation and proliferation and in the network of Cancer, Hematological disease and Immunological Disease. We used the FCVPPv2 for further in silico analysis and prioritized 45 coding and 79 non-coding variants from the three families. Further literature-based analysis allowed us to constrict this list to one rare germline variant each in families I and II and two in family III. Functional studies were conducted on the candidate from family I in a previous study, resulting in the identification and functional validation of a novel heterozygous missense variant in the tumor suppressor gene DICER1 as potential HL predisposition factor. We aim to identify the individual genes responsible for predisposition in the remaining two families and will functionally validate these in further studies.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014324v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014324v1.full.pdf","2019-12-19","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Community Perception and Attitude towards people with schizophrenia among residents of Arba Minch Zuria District, Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance System sites (AM-HDSS), Ethiopia. Cross-section study.","Abstract
Background:	Mental disorders are one of the public health issues throughout the worldwide. Among people with mental disorders, more than 21 million people have schizophrenia. However, there is scarcity of information about perception and attitude of the community toward people with schizophrenia in Ethiopia including the study area.
Objective: To assess the community perception and attitude towards people with schizophrenia among residents of Arba Minch Zuria District, Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance System sites (AM-HDSS), Southern Ethiopia
Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 617 randomly selected residents of Arba Minch Zuria District, AM-HDSS Site. The data was collected using structured, pre-tested and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means, and median were performed. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors affecting community attitude. 
Results: The finding of this study showed that, among study participants 469(76%) have a good perception towards people with schizophrenia and 390(63.2%) of respondents have positive attitudes towards people living with schizophrenia. Talkativeness and self-neglect behaviors were the most commonly mentioned manifestation of schizophrenia. Substance misuse and head injury were the most perceived cause of schizophrenia. Spiritual/traditional methods were preferred place for the treatment of schizophrenia. Age of respondents, sex of respondent; educational status and perception toward people with schizophrenia were significantly associated with positive attitude towards people with schizophrenia.  
Conclusions: Among our rural adults nearly half of the study participants have a negative attitude towards people with schizophrenia. Therefore, giving special attention to females, youths, uneducated and individuals who have poor perception toward people living with schizophrenia is crucial. Also, future mental health promotion activities should focus on cause and common manifestation of schizophrenia to improve the community attitude toward people with schizophrenia.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19015271v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19015271v1.full.pdf","2019-12-19","Public and Global Health

"Prenatal cannabis exposure and childhood outcomes: Results from the ABCD study","Importance: In light of increasing cannabis use among pregnant women, the Surgeon General of the United States issued an advisory against the use of marijuana during pregnancy on August 29th, 2019. 
Objective: To determine whether cannabis use during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes among offspring. 
Design: Cross-sectional analysis of the baseline session of the ongoing longitudinal Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study.
Setting: Data were collected from 22 sites across the United States between 2016 and 2018.
Participants: Children ages 9-11 (n=11,489) and their parent or caregiver.
Exposure: Prenatal marijuana exposure prior to and following maternal knowledge of pregnancy.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Child psychopathology symptomatology (i.e., psychotic-like experiences and internalizing, externalizing, attention, thought, and social problems), cognition, sleep, birth weight, gestational age at birth, body mass index (BMI), and brain structure (i.e., total intracranial volume, white matter volume, gray matter volume). Covariates included familial (e.g., income, familial psychopathology), pregnancy (e.g., prenatal vitamin use, whether the pregnancy was planned), and child (e.g., birth weight, substance use) variables.
Results: Among 11,489 children (age 9.90.6 years; 47.78% female), 655 (5.70%) were prenatally exposed to cannabis in total. Marijuana use prior to (n=648; 5.64%) and following (n=242; 2.11%) maternal knowledge of pregnancy were associated with increased offspring psychopathology characteristics (i.e., psychotic-like experiences and internalizing, externalizing, attention, thought, social, and sleep problems) and BMI as well as reduced cognition, birth weight, and brain structure (i.e., total white and gray mater volumes; all psfdr<.007), but not gestational age at birth. Exposure following maternal knowledge of pregnancy remained significantly associated with psychopathology, cognition, and birth weight outcomes when including potentially confounding variables (all ps<0.046). All associations with exposure prior to maternal knowledge of pregnancy were nonsignificant when considering potentially confounding variables (all ps>0.06). 
Conclusions and Relevance: Prenatal cannabis exposure, and its correlated factors, may increase risk for psychopathology and reduced cognition during middle childhood as well as reduced birthweight. Consistent with recent recommendations by the Surgeon General, marijuana use during pregnancy should be discouraged.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19015164v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19015164v1.full.pdf","2019-12-19","Epidemiology

"Comparative Evaluation of CHROMagar COL-APSE, MicroScan Walkaway, ComASPColistin, and Colistin MAC Test in Detecting Colistin-resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria","Colistin has become a critical antibiotic for fatal Gram-negative infections owing to the proliferation of multidrug-resistant carbapenemase-producing bacteria. Thus, cheaper, faster, efficient and easier-to-use colistin diagnostics are required for clinical surveillance, diagnoses and therapeutics. The sensitivity, specificity, major error (ME), very major error (VME), categorial agreement, essential agreement, turnaround time (TAT), average cost, and required skill for four colistin resistance diagnostics viz., CHROMagar COL-APSE, ComASP Colistin, MicroScan, and Colistin MAC Test (CMT) were evaluated against broth microdilution (BMD) using 84 Gram-negative bacterial isolates. A multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used to screen all isolates to detect the presence of the mcr-1 to mcr-5 genes. A 15-point grading scale was used to grade the tests under skill, ease, processing time etc. mcr-1 was detected by both M-PCR and CMT in a single E. coli isolate. The sensitivity and specificity of CHROMagar COL-APSE, MicroScan, and ComASP Colistin, were  82.05% and 66.67%,  92.31% and 76.92%, and 100% and 88.89% respectively. The MicroScan was the most expensive at a cost (per sampe tested) of R221.6 ($15.0), followed by CHROMagar COL-APSE (R118.3; $8.0), M-PCR (R75.1; $5.1), CMT (R20.1; $1.4) and ComASP Colistin (R2.64; $0.2). CHROMagar was the easiest to perform, followed by ComASP Colistin, M-PCR, MicroScan, CMT and BMD whilst M-PCR and MicroScan required higher skill.

"Factors associated with access to Insecticide-Treated Nets and use of house modification in Bagamoyo and Ulanga districts, Tanzania","Background:
Insecticide-treated Nets (ITNs) and house modifications are proven vector control tools, yet full coverage has frequently not been achieved. This study investigates factors associated with ITN access and use of house modification in Tanzania.
Methods:
Baseline data from cross-sectional surveys was analysed from 7,240 households in Bagamoyo (60km north of Dar es Salaam) and 1,241 households in Ulanga (a remote rural area), from previous studies on spatial repellants and indoor residual spray evaluation. We estimated the associations between the outcomes: population access to ITNs, ITN per sleeping spaces, presence of window screens and closed eaves, and the covariates household size, age, gender, pregnancy, education, mosquito entry (doors and windows), house modification (window screens & closed eaves), mean distance to mosquito breeding sites and wealth using regression models.
Result:
Population access to ITNs (households with one ITN per two potential people that stayed in the house the previous night of the survey) was 64% (56 - 71) and ITNs per sleeping spaces (households with enough ITNs to cover all sleeping spaces used the previous night of the survey) was 63% (54 - 72) in Bagamoyo, three years after the last Universal Coverage Campaigns (UCC). These findings are both lower than the 80% coverage target of the Tanzania National Malaria Strategic Plan (Tanzania NMSP). In Ulanga, population access to ITNs was 84% (78 - 91) and ITNs per sleeping spaces was 93% (89 - 97), one year after the last UCC. Household size was significantly associated with lower access to ITNs even shortly after UCC. House modification was common in both areas. In Bagamoyo, screened windows were more common than closed eaves (61% vs 14%) whereas in Ulanga more houses had closed eaves than window screens (55% vs 12%). Households in the poorest quintile were less likely to adopt window screening and closing eaves in Bagamoyo, this contrasts with Ulanga district where a greater proportion of poorer households blocked eaves with mud but were less likely to adopt screening.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015081v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015081v1.full.pdf","2019-12-19","Public and Global Health

"Gender score development in a retrospective approach in the Berlin Aging Study II","In addition to biological sex, gender, the sociocultural dimension of being a woman or a man, plays a central role in health. However, there are so far no approaches to quantify gender in a retrospective manner in existing study datasets.  We therefore aimed to develop a methodology that can be retrospectively applied to assess gender in existing cohorts. We used baseline data from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II), obtained in 2009-2014 from 1869 participants aged 60 years and older. We identified 13 gender related variables and used them to construct a gender score (GS) by primary component and logistic regression analysis. Of these, 9 variables contributed to a gender score: chronic stress, marital status, risk taking behavior, agreeableness, neuroticism, extraversion, loneliness, conscientiousness, and education. GS differed significantly between females and males as defined by sex. Next, we calculated linear regressions to investigate associations between sex, GS, and selected biological and well-being variables. Sex, but not GS was significantly associated with LDL-C and TC. GS, but not sex, was significantly associated with cortisol levels, CES-depression, negative affect, life satisfaction. Thus, we were able to develop a GS in a retrospective manner from available study variables that characterized women and men in addition to biological sex. This approach will allow us to introduce the notion of gender retrospectively into a large number of studies.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015032v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015032v1.full.pdf","2019-12-19","Public and Global Health

"Blood pressure and cognitive function across the eighth decade: a prospective study of the Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936","Objectives
We investigated the associations among blood pressure and cognitive functions across the eighth decade, while accounting for anti-hypertensive medication and lifetime stability in cognitive function.
Design 
Prospective cohort study.
Setting 
This study used data from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) study, which recruited participants living in the Lothian region of Scotland when aged 70 years, most of whom had completed an intelligence test at age 11 years.
Participants
1091 members of the LBC1936 with assessments of cognitive ability in childhood and older adulthood, and blood pressure measurements in older adulthood.
Primary and secondary outcome measures 
Participants were followed up at ages 70, 73, 76, and 79, and latent growth curve models and linear mixed models were used to analyse both cognitive functions and blood pressure as primary outcomes.
Results
Blood pressure followed a quadratic trajectory in the eighth decade: on average blood pressure rose in the first waves and subsequently fell. Intercepts and trajectories were not associated between blood pressure and cognitive functions. Women with higher early-life cognitive function generally had lower blood pressure during the eighth decade. Being prescribed anti-hypertensive medication was associated with lower blood pressure, but not with better cognitive function.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate an association between early-life cognitive function and later-life blood pressure, specifically among women. However, we did not find support for the hypothesis that rises in blood pressure and worse cognitive decline are associated with one another in the eighth decade.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015040v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015040v1.full.pdf","2019-12-19","Geriatric Medicine

"Biopsy-free prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness using deep learning and radiology imaging","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely used to visualize the prostate gland and manage prostate cancer. The Prostate Imaging Reporting And Data System (PI-RADS) is used to evaluate the clinical risk associated with a potential tumor. However the PI-RADS score is subjective and its assessment varies between physicians. As a result, a definite diagnosis of prostate cancer requires a biopsy to obtain tissue for pathologic analysis. A prostate biopsy is an invasive procedure and is associated with complications, including hematospermia, hematuria, and rectal bleeding. We hypothesized that an Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be trained on prostate cases where both imaging and biopsy are available to distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from non-aggressive lesions using MRI imaging only, that is, without the need for a biopsy. Our computational method, named AI-biopsy, can distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from non-aggressive disease with an AUC of 0.855 and a 79.02% accuracy. We used Class Activation Maps (CAM) to highlight which regions of MRI images are being used by our algorithm for classification, and found that AI-biopsy generally focuses on the same regions that trained uro-radiolosts focus on, with a few exceptions. In conclusion, AI-biopsy provides a data-driven and reproducible way to assess cancer aggressiveness from MRI images and a personalized strategy to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015057v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015057v1.full.pdf","2019-12-19","Radiology and Imaging

"A robust gene expression signature to predict proteasome inhibitor benefit in Multiple Myeloma","Many cancer drugs only benefit a subset of the patients that receive them, but are often associated with serious side effects. Predictive classification methods that can identify which patients will benefit from a specific treatment are therefore of great clinical utility. We here introduce a novel machine learning method to identify predictive gene expression signatures, based on the idea that patients who received different treatments but exhibit similar expression profiles can be used to model response to the alternative treatment. We use this method to predict proteasome inhibitor benefit in Multiple Myeloma (MM). In a dataset of 910 MM patients we identify a 14-gene expression signature that can successfully predict benefit to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, with a hazard ratio of 0.47 (p = 0.04) in class benefit, while in class no benefit the hazard ratio is 0.91 (p = 0.68). Importantly, we observe a similar classification performance (HR class benefit = 0.46, p = 0.04) in an independent patient cohort which was moreover measured on a different platform, demonstrating the robustness of the signature. Moreover, we find that the genes in the discovered signature are essential, as no equivalent signature can be found when they are excluded from the analysis. Multiple genes in the signature are linked to working mechanisms of proteasome inhibitors or MM disease progression. In conclusion, our method allows for identification of gene expression signatures that can aid in treatment decisions for MM patients and provide insight into the biological mechanism behind treatment benefit.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015024v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015024v1.full.pdf","2019-12-19","Oncology

By investigating the relationship between gut health, well-being and nutrient intake we aim to recognize areas through which health might be promoted.
Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was performed enrolling 229 older adults (=65 years). Validated questionnaires were used to assess gut health, nutrient intake and well-being. 
Results: 65% of the participant experienced gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms significantly correlated to anxiety, stress and decreased quality of life. Dyspepsia correlated to a lower energy percentage of protein. An intake below the nutritional recommendations was found for protein, fibre, fat (monounsaturated/polyunsaturated), while an intake above the recommendations was found for saturated fats and alcohol
Discussion: A majority of the community-dwelling older adults experienced gastrointestinal symptoms and had an imbalanced macronutrient intake.

"DRUG-INDUCED DECREASED URINE OUTPUT PREDICTS PDA CLOSURE IN PRETERM NEONATES","Objective
Prostaglandin inhibitors (PGI) are used to treat patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) of prematurity. PGIs often cause decrease in urine output (UO), the mechanism of which is like that of PDA closure. We hypothesized that PGI-induced decrease in UO predicts PDA closure. 
Design
Prospective, cohort
Setting
Level III NICU
Methods
We prospectively enrolled 40 preterm neonates (less than or equal to 34 weeks gestation) with clinical and/or echocardiographic hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA), being treated with Ibuprofen or Paracetamol. We measured UO, weight, total fluid intake (TFI) at baseline and daily until 72 h. We performed echocardiogram at baseline and daily until PDA closure or end of treatment. We compared PDA-closed and PDA-open groups for change in UO, weight and TFI from baseline.
Results
PDA-closed and PDA-open groups had 28 and 12 neonates respectively. Median (Q1, Q3) percent decrease in UO was greater in PDA-closed vs PDA-open group: from baseline to 0-24 h [-44.87% (-54.79%, +0.04%) vs -15.03% (-27.91%, +49.11%)]; to 24-48 hours                  [-40.85% (-52.81%, +14.45%) vs. -2.57% (-24.82%, +61.73%) and to 48-72 hours [-32.77% (-49.4%, +32.22%) vs. +20.74% (-6.88%, +98.39%). PDA closed group had significantly greater percent decrease in weight by 72-h. Mixed linear model showed that group and time were independently associated with UO; but group*time interaction and covariates (echocardiographic hsPDA, weight, gestation, postnatal age) were not. Decrease in UO of 27% and 17% by 24-48 h and 48-72 h respectively, best predicted PDA closure.
Conclusions
Transient decrease in UO after treating hsPDA with a PGI may predict successful closure of PDA.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.15.19014993v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.15.19014993v1.full.pdf","2019-12-19","Pediatrics

"Public Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in Medicine","Objective: To understand better the public perception and comprehension with medical technology such as artificial intelligence and robotic surgery. Additionally, to identify sensitivity to, and comfort with, the use of AI and robotics in medicine a in order to ensure acceptability and quality of counseling and to guide future development.

Subjects and Methods: A survey was conducted on a convenience sample of visitors to the Minnesota State Fair (n = 264). The survey investigated participant beliefs on the capabilities of AI and robotics in medicine and their comfort with such technology. Participants were randomized to receive one of two similar surveys. In the first a diagnosis was made by a physician and in the second by an AI application in order to compare confidence in human and computer-based diagnosis.

Results: The median age of participants was 45 (IQR 28-59), 58% were female (n=154) vs. 42% male (n=110), 69% had completed at least a bachelor's degree, 88% were Caucasian (n=233) vs. 12% ethnic minorities (n=31) and were from 12 states in the US with most from the Upper Midwest. Participants had nearly equal trust in AI vs. physician diagnoses, however, they were significantly more likely to trust an AI diagnosis of cancer over a doctor's diagnosis when responding to the version of the survey that suggested an AI could make medical diagnosis (p = 9.32e-06). Though 55% of respondents (n=145) reported they were uncomfortable with automated robotic surgery the majority of the individuals surveyed (88%) mistakenly believed that partially autonomous surgery was already being performed. Almost all (94%) stated they would be willing to pay for an AI to review their medical imaging, if available.

Conclusion: Most participants express confidence in AI providing medical diagnoses, sometimes even over human physicians. Participants generally expressed concern with surgical AI, but mistakenly believe it is already happening. As AI applications make their way into medical practice, health care providers should be cognizant of patient misconceptions and the sensitivity that patients have to how such technology is represented.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.15.19014985v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.15.19014985v1.full.pdf","2019-12-19","Urology

"Machine learning applied to atopic dermatitis transcriptome reveals distinct therapy-dependent modification of the keratinocyte immunophenotype","Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) arises from a complex interaction between an impaired epidermal barrier, environmental exposures, and the infiltration of Th1/Th2/Th17/Th22 T cells. Transcriptomic analysis has advanced understanding of gene expression in cells and tissues. However, molecular quantitation of cytokine transcripts does not predict the importance of a specific pathway in AD or cellular responses to different inflammatory stimuli.
Objective: To understand changes in keratinocyte transcriptomic programmes in human cutaneous disease during development of inflammation and in response to treatment.
Methods: We performed in silico deconvolution of the whole-skin transcriptome. Using co-expression clustering and machine learning tools, we resolved the gene expression of bulk skin (n=7 datasets, n=406 samples), firstly, into unsupervised keratinocyte immune response phenotypes and, secondly, into 19 cutaneous cell signatures of purified populations from publicly available datasets.
Results: We identify three unique transcriptomic programmes in keratinocytes, KC1, KC2, KC17, characteristic to immune signalling from disease-associated helper T cells. We cross-validate those signatures across different skin inflammatory conditions and disease stages and demonstrate that the keratinocyte response during treatment is therapy dependent. Broad spectrum treatment with ciclosporin ameliorated the KC17 response in AD lesions to a non-lesional immunophenotype, without altering KC2. Conversely, the specific anti-Th2 therapy, dupilumab, reversed the KC2 immunophenotype.
Conclusion: Our analysis of transcriptomic signatures in cutaneous disease biopsies reveals the complexity of keratinocyte programming in skin inflammation and suggests that the perturbation of a single axis of immune signal alone may be insufficient to resolve keratinocyte immunophenotype abnormalities.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014977v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014977v1.full.pdf","2019-12-19","Dermatology

"Early screening of autism spectrum disorder using cry features","Due to the importance of automatic and early autism screening, in this paper, a cry-based screening approach for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is introduced. During the study, we realized that the ASD specific features are not necessarily observable among all ASD subjects and among all instances of each subject. Therefore, we proposed a new classification approach to be able to find such features and their correspondign instances. We tested the proposed approach and found two features that can be used to distinguish groups of children with ASD from Typically Developed (TD) children. In other words, these features are present in subsets of children with ASD not all of them. The approach has been tested on a dataset including 14 male and 7 female children with ASD and 14 male and 7 female TD children,  between 18 to 53 months of age. The sensitivity, specificity, and precision of the proposed approach for male subjects were 85.71%, 100%, and 92.85%, respectively. These measures were 71.42%, 100%, and 85.71% for feamale subjects, respectively.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016022v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016022v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Automatic detection of generalized paroxysmal fast activity in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome using a bi-modal EEG time-frequency feature","Objective: Mark-up of generalized interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) on EEG is an important step in the diagnosis and characterization of epilepsy. However, manual EEG mark-up is a time-consuming, subjective, and highly specialized task where the human reviewer needs to visually inspect a large amount of data to facilitate accurate clinical decisions. The objective of this study was to develop a framework for automated detection of generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA),  which is a characteristic type of generalized IED seen in scalp EEG recordings of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a severe form of drug-resistant generalized epilepsy.
Methods: We studied 13 children with LGS who had GPFA events in their interictal EEG recordings. Time-frequency information derived from manually marked IEDs across multiple EEG channels was used to automatically detect similar events in each patient's interictal EEG. We validated true positives and false positives of the proposed spike detection approach using both standalone scalp EEG and simultaneous EEG-functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) recordings.
Results: GPFA events displayed a consistent low-high frequency arrangement in the time-frequency domain. This bi-modal spectral feature was most prominent over frontal EEG channels. Our automatic detection approach using this feature identified likely epileptic events with similar time-frequency properties to the manually marked GPFAs. Brain maps of EEG-fMRI signal change during these automatically detected IEDs were comparable to the EEG-fMRI brain maps derived from manual IED mark-up. 
Conclusion: GPFA events have a characteristic bi-modal time-frequency feature that can be automatically detected from scalp EEG recordings in patients with LGS. Validity of this time-frequency feature is demonstrated by EEG-fMRI analysis of automatically detected events, which recapitulates the brain maps we have previously shown to underlie generalized IEDs in LGS.  
Significance: This study provides a novel methodology that paves the way for quick, automated, and objective inspection of generalized IEDs in LGS. The proposed framework may be extendable to a wider range of epilepsy syndromes in which monitoring the burden of epileptic activity can aid clinical decision-making. For example, automated quantification of generalized discharges may permit faster assessment of treatment response and estimation of future seizure risk.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016089v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016089v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Neurology

"Is e-cigarette use in non-smoking young adults associated with later smoking? A systematic review and meta-analysis","Objective: The aim of this review was to investigate whether e-cigarette use compared to non-use in young non-smokers is associated with subsequent cigarette smoking. 
Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Wiley Cochrane Library databases, and the 2018 Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco and Society for Behavioural Medicine conference abstracts. 
Study selection: All studies of young people (up to age 30 years) with a measure of e-cigarette use prior to smoking and an outcome measure of smoking where an odds ratio could be calculated were included (excluding reviews and animal studies). 
Data Extraction: Independent extraction was completed by multiple authors using a pre-prepared extraction form. 
Data synthesis: Of 9,199 results, 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. There was strong evidence for an association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and later smoking (OR 4.59, 95% CI 3.60 to 5.85) when the results were meta-analysed in a random effects model. However, there was high heterogeneity (I2 = 88%). 
Conclusions: Whilst the association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and subsequent smoking appears strong, the available evidence is limited by the reliance on self-report measures of smoking history without biochemical verification. None of the studies included negative controls which would provide stronger evidence for whether the association may be causal. Much of the evidence also failed to consider the nicotine content of e-liquids used by non-smokers meaning it is difficult to make conclusions about whether nicotine is the mechanism driving this association.","/content/10.1101/19007005v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007005v2.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Epidemiology

"A new incidence peak of childhood narcolepsy type 1 in 2013:a new perspective on the role of influenza virus?","Increased incidence rates of narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) after the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic (pH1N1) have been reported world-wide. While some European countries found an association between the NT1 increase and H1N1 vaccination Pandemrix, reports from Asian countries suggested the H1N1 virus rather than Pandemrix to be linked with the increase of new NT1 cases. We analyzed the number of de-novo NT1 cases in the last two decades until 2016 using the European Narcolepsy Network (EU-NN) database. Using robust data-driven modelling approaches we confirmed the peak of NT1 incidence in 2009-2010 pH1N1 and identified a new peak in 2013 that is age-specific for children/adolescents. Most of these de-novo cases showed a subacute disease onset consistent with an immune-mediated type of narcolepsy, which is most likely not related to Pandemrix vaccination that was used in 2009-2010, but may have been triggered by some new epidemiological event in Europe. Our finding of an unexpected peak in de-novo children narcolepsy in 2013 provides a unique opportunity to develop new hypotheses, such as considering other (influenza) viruses to further investigate the pathophysiology of immune-mediated narcolepsy.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016246v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016246v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Neurology

"A genomic epidemiology investigation of yaws re-emergence and bacterial drug resistance selection","Background: In a longitudinal study assessing the WHO strategy for yaws eradication using mass azithromycin treatment, we observed resurgence of yaws cases with dominance of a single JG8 sequence type and emergence of azithromycin-resistant Treponema pallidum. Here, we analyse genomic changes in the bacterial population using samples collected during the study.
Methods: We performed whole bacterial genome sequencing directly on DNA extracted from 37 lesion swabs collected from patients on Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, between 2013 and 2016. We produced phylogenies and correlated these with temporo-spatial information to investigate the source of new cases and the emergence of five macrolide-resistant cases. We used deep amplicon sequencing of surveillance samples to assess the presence of minority macrolide resistance populations.
Findings: We recovered 20 whole Treponema genomes, and phylogenetic analysis showed that the re-emerging JG8 sequence type was composed of three bacterial sub-lineages characterised by distinct temporo-spatial patterns. Of five patients with resistant Treponema, all epidemiologically linked, we recovered genomes from three and found no variants. Deep sequencing showed that pre-treatment, the index patient harboured fixed macrolide-sensitive Treponema, while the post-treatment sample harboured a fixed resistant genotype, as did three of four contact cases. We also found no evidence of pre-existing minority Treponema drug-resistance variants in the general population. 
Interpretation: In this study, re-emergence of yaws cases was polyphyletic, indicating multiple epidemiological sources. However, given the genomic and epidemiological linkage of resistant cases and the rarity of resistance alleles in the general population, it is likely that azithromycin resistance evolved only once in this study, followed by onward dissemination.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016220v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016220v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Epidemiology

"Galantamine alleviates oxidative stress alongside anti-inflammatory and cardio-metabolic effects in subjects with the metabolic syndrome in a randomized trial","Background: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an obesity-driven disorder with pandemic proportions and limited treatment options. Oxidative stress, low-grade inflammation and altered autonomic regulation, are important components of MetS pathophysiology. We recently reported that galantamine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and an FDA-approved drug (for Alzheimer's disease) alleviates the inflammatory state in MetS subjects. Here we examined the effects of galantamine on oxidative stress in parallel with inflammatory and cardio-metabolic parameters in subjects with MetS. 
Methods: The effects of galantamine treatment, 8 mg daily for 4 weeks, followed by 16 mg daily for 8 weeks or placebo were studied in randomly assigned subjects with MetS (n=22 per group) of both genders. Oxidative stress, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase activities, lipid and protein peroxidation, and nitrite levels were analyzed before and at the end of the treatment. In addition, plasma cytokine and adipokine levels, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and other relevant cardio-metabolic indices were analyzed. Autonomic regulation was also examined by heart rate variability (HRV) before treatment, and at every 4 weeks of treatment. 
Results: Galantamine treatment significantly increased antioxidant enzyme activities, including SOD (+1.65 USOD/mg protein, [95% CI 0.39 to 2.92], P=0.004) and CAT (+0.93 nmol/mg, [95% CI 0.34 to 1.51], P=0.011), decreased lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, -5.45 pmol/mg, [95% CI -10.97 to 0.067], P=0.053) and systemic nitrite levels (-0.05 nit/mg protein, [95% CI -0.21 to 0.10], P=0.038) compared with placebo. In addition, galantamine significantly alleviated the inflammatory state and insulin resistance, and decreased the low frequency/high frequency ratio of HRV, following 8 and 12 weeks of drug treatment.
Conclusion: Low-dose galantamine alleviates oxidative stress, alongside beneficial anti-inflammatory, and metabolic effects, and modulates autonomic regulation in subjects with MetS. These findings are of considerable interest for further studies with galantamine to ameliorate MetS pathophysiology.

"How to implement and use findings from patient experience surveys in Australian general practice: A qualitative expert consultation study","Objective
To identify barriers (patient, provider, practice, and system levels) to consider when implementing patient experience surveys in Australian general practice, and enablers of their systematic use to inform service improvement in clinical practice as well as the broader health system.
Methods and Analysis
An expert consultation and qualitative content analysis of cross-sectional, open-text survey data. Data was collected from key international and Australian experts in the areas of measurement and quality improvement in general practice.
Results
Participants discussed the importance of ensuring value and relevance of surveys to stakeholders. Lack of resources, IT infrastructure, capacity building, and sustained funding were identified as barriers to implementing surveys. Participants discussed the importance of clearly defining and communicating the purpose of surveys and agreed on the value of using patient experience to inform reflective, team-based learning at the practice level. Opinions differed on the use of patient experience data at the system-level, with some questioning its utility or fairness for external performance reporting. Others recommended the aggregation and reporting of this data under certain conditions, including for the purpose of triangulation with other quality and outcome data. The study identified an evidence gap in the assessment and interpretation of patient experience data at all levels, including the analysis and contextualisation of survey findings at the system level. 
Conclusion
Patient experience surveys have potential for guiding practice level quality improvement but many barriers to their implementation remain. There is need for greater research and policy efforts to understand how this information can be used at the system level for improving Australian primary care.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.19016121v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.19016121v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Primary Care Research

"Interprofessional Learning in Immediate Life Support training improves simulated patient related outcomes.","Aim of the study:
To assess team performance in implementing time critical key interventions during a simulated resuscitation after participating in either an interprofessional-learning (IPL) or uniprofessional-learning (UPL) Immediate Life Support training course (ILS).
Introduction:
Much of the published work on team-based simulation training has measured the lower levels of Kirkpatricks hierarchy of evidence and effectiveness. This study aimed to ascertain if interprofessional team training could improve a higher level of outcome such as behaviour and patient outcomes.
Methods: 
A retrospective quantitative analysis of time critical points in a simulated cardiac arrest resuscitation, from a previous randomised study on the effects of Interprofessional Learning in ILS. The video recordings from the original study consisting of medical (n=48) and nursing (n=48) were analysed to mark when either the IPL or UPL team performed a time critical intervention. 
Results:
Five time-critical points for interventions were identified; confirmation of cardiac arrest, commencement of initial CPR, rhythm check, time to 1st shock and delay in restarting CPR. Parametric testing of each of these time-based criteria were subjected to an independent sample t-test with statistically significant findings in three of the five criteria in favour of those who had undertaken the interprofessional learning.
Conclusion: 
Our results demonstrate that through an IPL approach in ILS there was a statistically different improvement in mean times to performing time-critical interventions, which if transferred to the clinical environment could improve and impact on both change of behaviour and patient outcomes in Kirkpatricks higher levels of evidence and effectiveness.
Though this study shows that team behaviour and performing time-critical interventions can improve in the short-term, we acknowledge that further longitudinal studies are required to ascertain the effect of such improvement over time. So that both as researchers and educators we can make healthcare teams work safer and more efficiently to improve patient outcomes.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016170v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016170v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Medical Education

"Evaluating the performance of the WHO international reference standard for osteoporosis diagnosis in postmenopausal women of varied polygenic score and race","Background: Whether the bone mineral density (BMD) T-score performs differently in osteoporosis classification in women of different genetic profiling and race background remains unclear. Methods: The genomic data in the Women's Health Initiative study was analyzed (n=2,417). The polygenic score (PGS) was calculated from 63 BMD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each participant. The World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of osteoporosis (BMD T-score=-2.5) was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of fracture. Results: T-score classification significantly underestimated the risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) in the WHI study. An enormous underestimation was observed in African American women (POR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.30-0.83) and in women with low PGS (predicted/observed ratio [POR]: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.28-0.64). Compared to Caucasian women, African American, African Indian, and Hispanic women respectively had a 59%, 41%, and 55% lower hazard of MOF after the T-score was adjusted for. The results were similar when used for any fractures. Conclusions: Our study suggested the BMD T-score performance varies significantly by race in postmenopausal women.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.19016154v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.19016154v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Epidemiology

"Neuromagnetic speech discrimination responses are associated with reading-related skills in dyslexic and typical readers","Dyslexia is currently thought to be based on poor phonological processing. We investigated neural speech-sound discrimination in adults with or without dyslexia by recording mismatch fields (MMF) with magnetoencephalogram (MEG) and by determining their association with reading-related skills. We expected weak and atypically lateralized MMFs in dyslexics, and associations between reading-related skills and MMF strength. Responses were recorded to a repeating pseudoword /ta-ta/ with occasional changes in vowel identity, vowel duration, or syllable frequency from 43 adults, 21 with confirmed dyslexia. Phonological processing, reading, working memory, and IQ were additionally assessed. Speech-sound changes elicited MMFs and late MMFs in bilateral auditory cortices, with no group differences in source strengths. MMFs and/or late MMFs to vowel identity and duration changes were left-lateralized. Better verbal working memory was associated with stronger left-hemispheric MMF sources across groups, suggesting the relevance of verbal working memory for speech processing. Faster and more accurate technical reading was associated with stronger right-hemispheric MMF sources in dyslexics, which might suggest a right-hemispheric compensatory mechanism for language processing. In conclusion, contrary to prior work, our results did not support deficient speech-sound processing in dyslexia. However, in line with previous studies, we showed left-lateralized MMFs to speech sound changes and their association with reading-related skills, promoting the use of MMFs in investigating reading-related brain processes.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.29.19016113v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.29.19016113v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Neurology

"Classification of glomerular pathological findings using deep learning and nephrologist-AI collective intelligence approach","Background:
Automated classification of glomerular pathological findings is potentially beneficial in establishing an efficient and objective diagnosis in renal pathology. While previous studies have verified the artificial intelligence (AI) models for the classification of global sclerosis and glomerular cell proliferation, there are several other glomerular pathological findings required for diagnosis, and the comprehensive models for the classification of these major findings have not yet been reported. Whether the cooperation between these AI models and clinicians improves diagnostic performance also remains unknown. Here, we developed AI models to classify glomerular images for major findings required for pathological diagnosis and investigated whether those models could improve the diagnostic performance of nephrologists. 
Methods:
We used a dataset of 283 kidney biopsy cases comprising 15888 glomerular images that were annotated by a total of 25 nephrologists. AI models to classify seven pathological findings: global sclerosis, segmental sclerosis, endocapillary proliferation, mesangial matrix accumulation, mesangial cell proliferation, crescent, and basement membrane structural changes, were constructed using deep learning by fine-tuning of InceptionV3 convolutional neural network. Subsequently, we compared the agreement to truth labels between majority decision among nephrologists with or without the AI model as a voter.
Results:
Our model for global sclerosis showed high performance (area under the curve: periodic acid-Schiff, 0.986; periodic acid methenamine silver, 0.983); the models for the other findings also showed performance close to those of nephrologists. By adding the AI model output to majority decision among nephrologists, the sensitivity and specificity were significantly improved in 9 of 14 constructed models compared to those of nephrologists alone.
Conclusion:
Our study showed a proof-of-concept for the classification of multiple glomerular findings in a comprehensive method of deep learning and suggested its potential effectiveness in improving diagnostic accuracy of clinicians.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.19016162v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.19016162v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Pathology

"A Preoperative Estimate of Central Venous Pressure Is Associated with Early Fontan Failure","Objective 
Early Fontan Failure (EFF) is a serious complication following total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC), characterised by high central venous pressure (CVP), low cardiac output and resistance to medical therapy. This study aimed to estimate post-operative CVP in TCPC patients (CVPTCPC) using data routinely collected during pre-operative assessment. We sought to determine if this metric correlated with measured post-operative CVP and if it was associated with EFF.

Methods 
In this retrospective study, CVPTCPC was estimated in 131 patients undergoing pre-TCPC assessment by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and CVP measurement under general anaesthesia. Post-operative CVP during the first 24hours in ICU was collected from electronic patient records in a subset of patients. EFF was defined as death, transplantation, TCPC takedown or emergency fenestration within the first 30days.

Results
Estimated CVPTCPC correlated significantly with CVPICU (r=0.26, p=0.03), particularly in patients without a fenestration (r=0.45, p=0.01). CVPTCPC was significantly associated with EFF (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.12 (1.02-1.24), p=0.02). A threshold of CVPTCPC  =33mmHg was found to have the highest specificity (90%) and sensitivity (67%) for identifying EFF (area under receiver operating curve, AUC = 0.79), OR 18.8 (3.1-114), p=0.001. This association was stronger in patients with single SVCs.

Conclusions
Estimated CVPTCPC is an easily calculated metric combining pre-operative pressure and flow data. Higher CVPTCPC is associated with an increased risk of EFF and is correlated with directly measured post-TCPC pressure. Identification of patients at risk of EFF has the potential to guide risk mitigation strategies.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016048v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016048v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Everolimus improves the efficacy of dasatinib in the treatment of PDGFRA-driven glioma","Background: Pediatric and adult high-grade glioma (HGG) frequently harbor PDGFRA alterations. Treatment of PDGFRA-driven HGG with targeted agents, such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib, has failed in the clinic. We hypothesized that co-treatment with everolimus may improve the efficacy of dasatinib in PDGFRA-driven glioma through combinatorial synergism and increased tumor accumulation of dasatinib. 
Methods: Dose response, synergism studies, P-gp inhibition and pharmacokinetic studies were performed on in vitro and in vivo human and mouse models of HGG. De novo tumors were generated in mice using intra-uterine electroporation (IUE) by injecting PB plasmids of TP53 mutation, PDGFRA mutation and H3K27M mutation (PPK) in the lateral vertical of mice embryos. Two children with recurrent PDGFRA-driven HGG were treated with dasatinib and everolimus with correlate CSF analysis.
Results: Dasatinib effectively inhibited the proliferation of mouse and human primary HGG cells with a dose-dependent reduction of PDGFRA and pPDGFRA. Dasatinib exhibited synergy with everolimus in the treatment of HGG cells at low nanomolar concentrations of both agents. Prolonged exposure to everolimus significantly improved the CNS retention of dasatinib and extended survival of PPK tumor bearing mice. Two children with recurrent PDGFRA-driven HGG treated with dasatinib and everolimus survived six months and nine months after progression. A paired CSF sample from the patient with PDGFRA-amplified HGG showed 50% increase in CSF dasatinib levels after the addition of everolimus. 
Conclusion: Efficacy of dasatinib treatment of PDGFRA-driven HGG is improved with everolimus and suggests a promising route for improving targeted therapy for this patient population.

"Taxonomic Signatures of Long-Term Mortality Risk in Human Gut Microbiota","The collection of fecal material and developments in sequencing technologies have enabled cost-efficient, standardized, and non-invasive gut microbiome profiling. As a result, microbiome composition data from several large cohorts have been cross-sectionally linked to various lifestyle factors and diseases. In spite of these advances, prospective associations between microbiome composition and health have remained uncharacterized due to the lack of sufficiently large and representative population cohorts with comprehensive follow-up data. Here, we analyse the long-term association between gut microbiome variation and mortality in a large, well-phenotyped, and representative population cohort (n = 7211, FINRISK 2002; Finland). We report specific taxonomic and functional signatures related to the Enterobacteriaceae family in the human gut microbiome that predict mortality during a 15-year follow-up. These associations can be observed both in the Eastern and Western Finns who have differing genetic backgrounds, lifestyles, and mortality rates. Our results supplement previously reported cross-sectional associations, and help to establish a methodological and conceptual basis for examining long-term associations between human gut microbiome composition, incident outcomes, and general health status. These findings could serve as a solid framework for microbiome profiling in clinical risk prediction, paving the way towards clinical applications of human microbiome sequencing aimed at prediction, prevention, and treatment of disease.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.19015842v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.19015842v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Epidemiology

"Longitudinal characterization of Plasmodium inter-species interactions during a period of 1 increasing prevalence of Plasmodium ovale","Abstract (296 Words)
Background The epidemiology and severity of non-falciparum malaria in endemic settings has garnered limited attention. We aimed to characterize the prevalence, interaction, clinical risk factors and temporal trends of non-falciparum malaria in endemic settings of Kenya. 
Methods We diagnosed and analyzed infecting malaria species via PCR in 2027 clinical samples collected between 2008 and 2016. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence and distribution of Plasmodium species. A statistical model was designed and used for estimating the frequency of Plasmodium species and assessing inter-species interactions. Mixed effect linear regression models with random intercepts for each location was used to test for change in prevalence over time. 
Findings 72.5% of the samples were P. falciparum single species infections, 25.8% were mixed infections and only 1.7% occurred as single non-falciparum species infections. 23.1% were mixed infections containing P. ovale. A likelihood-based model calculation of the population frequency of each species estimated a significant within-host interference between P. falciparum and P. ovale curtisi. Mixed-effect logistic regression models identified a significant increase of P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi species over time with reciprocal decrease in P. falciparum single species and P. malariae. The risk of P. falciparum infections presenting with fever was 0.43 times less likely if co-infected with P. malariae. 
Interpretation Findings show higher prevalence of non-falciparum malaria than expected. The proportion of infections that were positive for infection by P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi was observed to significantly increase over the period of study which could be due to attenuated responsiveness to malaria drug treatment on these species. The increase in frequency of P. ovale spp in Kenya could threaten malaria control effort in Kenya and pose increased risk of malaria to travelers.

"Heterogeneity and heterotypic continuity of emotional and behavioral profiles across development","Objective: To identify profiles of emotional and behavioral symptoms from early childhood to adolescence, their stability across development and associated factors.
Method: Our sample included 17,216 children assessed at ages 3, 5, 7, 11, and 14 from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. We used latent profile and latent transition analysis to study their emotional and behavioral profiles from early childhood to adolescence. We included sociodemographic, family, and parenting variables to study the effect on the latent profile's membership and transitions.
Results: The number and specific profiles of emotional and behavioral symptoms change with the developmental stage. We found a higher number of profiles for ages 3, 5, and 14, which suggests greater heterogeneity in the presentation of emotional and behavioral symptoms for early childhood and adolescence compared to late childhood. There was greater heterotypic continuity between ages 3 and 5, particularly in transitions from higher to lower severity profiles. Children exposed to socioeconomic disadvantages were more likely to belong or transition to any moderate or high emotional and behavioral symptoms profiles. Maternal psychological distress and harsh parenting were associated with internalizing and externalizing profiles, respectively. Adolescents with high externalizing and internalizing symptoms had the greatest likelihood of reporting substance use, self-harm, and lower mental wellbeing.
Conclusion: Emotional and behavioral symptoms develop early in life, with levels of heterogeneity and heterotypic stability that change throughout development. These results call for interventions for the prevention and treatment of pediatric mental illness that can account for the heterogeneity and stability of symptoms across development.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015917v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015917v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"How comprehensive is the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for identifying clinical trial registration?: the protocol of a diagnostic study","Objectives. To evaluate whether or not systematic reviewers can use Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to identify ongoing and unpublished studies instead of searching International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov). 
Methods. This will be a diagnostic accuracy test study. We will collect a consecutive sample of ongoing or unpublished studies on Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSRs) during the last six months. We will use all of the records as our reference standard and evaluated whether they are part of the CENTRAL search presented in the CDSRs. 
The index test is the CENTRAL search using the search terms in the CDSRs, and the reference standard is the list of ongoing or unpublished studies registered on the ICTRP or CT.gov in the CDSRs. 
We will assess the sensitivity and number needed to read. 
Ethics & Dissemination. This study does not require ethics approval. We registered this study protocol. We will publish the findings in a peer-reviewed journal and may present them at conferences. 
Discussion. This study may lessen the burden of systematic reviewers if this study clarifies CENTRAL search can be used for screening in records about ongoing or unpublished studies.

"Temporal Relationship of Computed and Structured Diagnoses in Electronic Health Record Data","The electronic health record (EHR) holds the prospect of providing more complete and timely access to clinical information for studies, quality assessments, and quality improvement compared to other data sources, such as administrative claims. Our goal was to assess the completeness and timeliness of structured diagnoses in the EHR compared to computed diagnoses for hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). We determined the amount of time for a structured diagnosis to be recorded in the EHR from when an equivalent diagnosis could be computed from other structured data elements, such as vital signs and laboratory results. Using our local instance of EHR data in the PCORnet common data model (CDM) with encounters from January 1, 2012 through February 10, 2019, we identified patients with at least two observations above threshold separated by at least 30 days. The thresholds were outpatient blood pressure of = 140/90 mmHg, any low-density lipoprotein = 130 mg/dl, or any hemoglobin A1c = 7%, respectively. The primary measure was the length of time between the computed diagnosis and the time at which a structured diagnosis could be identified within the EHR history or problem list. We found that 39.8% of those with HTN, 21.6% with HLD, and 1.0% with DM did not receive a corresponding structured diagnosis recorded in the EHR. For those who received a structured diagnosis, a mean of 389, 198, and 106 days elapsed before the patient had the corresponding diagnosis of HTN, HLD, or DM, respectively, recorded in the EHR. We identified a marked temporal delay between when a diagnosis can be computed or inferred and when an equivalent structured diagnosis is recorded within the EHR. These findings demonstrate the continued need for additional study of the EHR to avoid bias when using observational data and reinforce the need for computational approaches to identify clinical phenotypes.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19015628v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19015628v1.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Health Informatics

"Germline mutation rates in young adults predict longevity and reproductive lifespan","BACKGROUND:
Analysis of sequenced genomes from large three-generation families allows de novo mutations identified in Generation II individuals to be attributed to each of their parents' germlines in Generation I. Because germline mutations increase with age, we hypothesized that they directly limit the duration of childbearing in women, and if correlated with mutation accumulation in somatic tissues, also reflect systemic aging in both sexes. Here we test whether the germline mutation rates of Generation I individuals when they were young adults predict their remaining survival, as well as the women's reproductive lifespans.

METHODS:
Germline autosomal mutation counts in 122 Generation I individuals (61 women, 61 men) from 41 three-generation Utah CEPH families were converted to germline mutation rates by normalizing each subject's number of mutations to the callable portion of their genome. Age at death, cause of death, all-site cancer incidence, and reproductive histories were provided by the Utah Population Database, Cancer Registry, and Utah Genetic Reference Project. Fertility analyses were restricted to the 53 women whose age at last birth (ALB) was at least 30 years, the approximate age when the decline in female fertility begins. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to test the association of age-adjusted mutation rates (AAMRs) with aging-related outcomes. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the age when adult germline mutation accumulation rates are established.

FINDINGS:
Quartiles of increasing AAMRs were associated with increasing all-cause mortality rates in both sexes combined (test for trend, p=0.009); subjects in the top quartile of AAMRs experienced more than twice the mortality of bottom quartile subjects (hazard ratio [HR], 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-3.56; p=0.008; median survival difference = 4.7 years). Women with higher AAMRs had significantly fewer live births and a younger ALB. The analyses also indicate that adult germline mutation accumulation rates are established in adolescence, and that later menarche in women may delay mutation accumulation.

INTERPRETATION:
Parental-age-adjusted germline mutation rates in healthy young adults may provide a measure of both reproductive and systemic aging. Puberty may induce the establishment of adult mutation accumulation rates, just when DNA repair genes' expression levels are known to begin their lifelong decline.","/content/10.1101/19004184v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004184v3.full.pdf","2020-01-02","Epidemiology

However, we note widespread occurrences of left-right orientation errors in MRI open database repositories where volumes have contained systematic left-right flips between subject EPIs and anatomicals, due to having incorrect or missing file header information. Here we present a simple method in AFNI for determining the consistency of left and right within a  pair of acquired volumes for a particular subject;  the presence of EPI-anatomical inconsistency, for example, is a sign that dataset header information likely requires correction.  The method contains both a quantitative evaluation as well as a visualizable verification. We test the functionality using publicly available datasets. Left-right flipping is not immediately obvious in most cases, so we also present visualization methods for looking at this problem (and other potential problems), using examples from both FMRI and DTI datasets.","/content/10.1101/19009787v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009787v2.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Radiology and Imaging

"A Systematic Review on Psychological and Biological Mediators Between Adversity and Psychosis: Potential Targets for Treatment","Various psychological and biological pathways have been proposed as mediators between childhood adverse events (CA) and psychosis. A systematic review of the evidence in this domain is needed. The aim of this work is to systematically review the evidence on psychological and biological mediators between CA and psychosis across the psychosis spectrum. This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (registration number: CRD42018100846). Articles published between 1979 and July 2019 were identified through a literature search in OVID (PsychINFO; Medline and Embase). The evidence by each analysis and each study results are presented by group of mediator categories found in the review. The percentage of total effect mediated was calculated. 47 studies were included, with a total of 79,668  from general population (GP) and 3,189 from clinical samples. The quality of studies was judged as 'fair'. Our results showed (i) solid evidence of mediation between CA and psychosis by negative cognitive schemas about the self, the world, and others (NS); by dissociation and other PTSD symptoms; (ii) evidence of al mediation through an affective pathway (affective dysregulation, anxiety, and depression) in GP; (iii)  lack of studies exploring biological mediators. To conclude, we found evidence suggesting that various overlapping and not competing pathways contribute partially to the link between adversity and psychosis. Experiences of adversity, along with relevant mediators such as PTSD and mood related symptoms and NS, should be routinely assessed in patients with psychosis. Targeting such mediators through cognitive behavioural aproaches using trauma-focused therapy and/or pharmacological means could be a useful addition to the traditional treatment of positive symptoms.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014506v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014506v2.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Multifocal breast cancers are more prevalent in BRCA2 versus BRCA1 mutation carriers","Multifocal breast cancer is generally considered to be where two or more breast tumours are present within the same breast, but are clearly separated with no intervening in situ or invasive disease. It is seen in ~10% of breast cancer cases. This study investigates multifocality prevalence in BRCA1/2 mutant patients via cross-sectional analysis. Data from 211 women with BRCA1/2 mutations (91 BRCA1), (120 BRCA2), with breast cancer were collected including age, tumour focality, size, type, grade, and receptor profile. The prevalence of multifocality within this group was 25%, but within subgroups, prevalence amongst BRCA2 carriers was more than double that of BRCA1 carriers (p=0.001). Women affected by multifocal tumours had proportionately higher oestrogen receptor positivity (p=0.001), lower triple negativity (p=0.004), and were more likely to be younger at diagnosis compared with those with unifocal tumours (p=0.039). Odds of a BRCA2 carrier developing multifocal cancer were almost four-fold higher than a BRCA1 carrier (OR: 3.71, CI: 1.77 to 7.78, p=0.001). BRCA2 carriers show much greater multifocality than those carrying BRCA1. Multifocal tumours are strongly associated with being both BRCA2 mutant and oestrogen receptor positive.","/content/10.1101/19006478v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006478v2.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Surgery

"Accurate and reproducible prediction of ICU readmissions","Readmission in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with poor clinical outcomes and high costs. Traditional scoring methods to help clinicians deciding whether a patient is ready for discharge have failed to meet expectations, paving the way for machine learning based approaches. Freely available datasets such as MIMIC-III have served as benchmarking media to compare such tools. We used the OMOP-CDM version of MIMIC-III (MIMIC-OMOP) to train and evaluate a lightweight tree boosting method to predict readmission in ICU at different time points after discharge (3, 7, 15 and 30 days), outperforming existing solutions with an AUROC of 0.802 (SD=0.011) and a recall of 0.837 (SD=0.016) for 3-days readmission.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015909v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015909v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine

"Radiomics Features of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron-Emission Tomography as a Novel Prognostic Signature in Colorectal Cancer","Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of radiomics signatures derived from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). 
Methods: From April 2008 to Jan 2014, we identified CRC patients who underwent 18F-FDG-PET before starting any neoadjuvant treatments and surgery. Radiomics features were extracted from the primary lesions identified on 18F-FDG-PET. Patients were divided into a training and a validation set by random sampling. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model was applied for prognostic signature building with progression-free survival (PFS) using the training set. Using the calculated radiomics score, a nomogram was developed, and the clinical utility of this nomogram was assessed in the validation set. 
Results: Three-hundred-and-eight-one patients with surgically resected CRC patients (training set 228 vs. validation set 153) were included. In the training set, a radiomics signature called a rad_score was generated using two PET-derived features such as Gray Level Run Length Matrix_Long-Run Emphasis (GLRLM_LRE) and Grey-Level Zone Length Matrix_Short-Zone Low Gray-level Emphasis (GLZLM_SZLGE). Patients with a high-rad_score in the training and validation set had shorter PFS. Multivariable analysis revealed that the rad_score was an independent prognostic factor in both training and validation sets. A radiomics nomogram, developed using rad_score, nodal stage, and lymphovascular invasion, showed good performance in the calibration curve and comparable predictive power with the staging system in the validation set. 
Conclusion: Textural features derived from 18F-FDG-PET images may enable more detailed stratification of prognosis in patients with CRC.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.27.19015982v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.27.19015982v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Oncology

"To resect or not to resect? Unbiased performances of single and combined biomarkers in intra-operative corticography for tailoring during epilepsy surgery.","Objective: Signal analysis biomarkers, in an intra-operative setting, may be complementary tools to guide and tailor the resection in drug-resistant epilepsy patients. Unbiased assessment of biomarker performances are needed to evaluate their clinical usefulness and translation. We defined a realistic ground-truth scenario and compared the effectiveness of different biomarkers alone and combined to localize epileptogenic tissue. 
Methods: We investigated the performances of univariate, bivariate and multivariate signal biomarkers applied to 1 minute inter-ictal intra-operative electrocorticography to discriminate between electrodes covering normal or pathologic activity in 47 drug-resistant people with epilepsy (temporal and extra-temporal) who had been seizure-free one year after the operation. 
Results: The best result using a single biomarker was obtained using the phase-amplitude coupling measure for which the epileptogenic tissue was localized in 16 out of 47 patients. Combining the whole set of biomarkers provided an improvement of the performances: 20 out of 47 patients. Repeating the analysis only on the temporal-lobe resections we reached a sensitivity of 93% (28 out of 30) combining all the biomarkers.
Conclusion: We suggest that the assessment of biomarker performances on a ground-truth scenario is required to have a proper estimate on how biomarkers translate into clinical use. Phase-amplitude coupling seems the best performing single biomarker and combining biomarkers improves localization of epileptogenic tissue. However, sensitivity achieved is not adequate for the usage as a tool in the operation theater, but it can improve the understanding of pathophysiological process.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015883v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015883v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Neurology

"Statistical inference for association studies using electronic health records: handling both selection bias and outcome misclassification","Health research using electronic health records (EHR) has gained popularity, but misclassification of EHR-derived disease status and lack of representativeness of the study sample can result in substantial bias in effect estimates and can impact power and type I error. In this paper, we develop new strategies for handling disease status misclassification and selection bias in EHR-based association studies. We first focus on each type of bias separately. For misclassification, we propose three novel likelihood-based bias correction strategies. A distinguishing feature of the EHR setting is that misclassification may be related to patient-specific factors, and the proposed methods leverage data in the EHR to estimate misclassification rates without gold standard labels. For addressing selection bias, we describe how calibration and inverse probability weighting methods from the survey sampling literature can be extended and applied to the EHR setting. Addressing misclassification and selection biases simultaneously is a more challenging problem than dealing with each on its own, and we propose several new strategies to address this situation. For all methods proposed, we derive valid standard errors and provide software for implementation. We provide a new suite of statistical estimation and inference strategies for addressing misclassification and selection bias simultaneously that is tailored to problems arising in EHR data analysis. We apply these methods to data from The Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal EHR-linked biorepository.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015859v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015859v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Epidemiology

"Coagulation factor XII, XI, and VIII activity levels and secondary events after first ischemic stroke","Background and Purpose: Though risk for recurrent vascular events is high following ischemic stroke, little is known about risk factors for secondary events post-stroke. The coagulation factors XII, XI, and VII (FXII, FXI, and FVIII) have already been implicated in first thrombotic events, and our aim was to estimate their effects on vascular outcomes within 3 years after first stroke.
Methods: In the PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke Berlin (PROSCIS-B) study, we followed participants aged 18 and older for three years after first mild to moderate ischemic stroke event or until occurrence of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction or all-cause mortality (combined endpoint). High coagulation factor activity levels were compared to normal and low levels, and activities were also analyzed as continuous variables. We used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the combined endpoint.
Results: In total, 92 events occurred in 570 included participants, resulting in an absolute rate of 6.6 events per 100 person-years. After confounding adjustment, high FVIII activity showed the strongest relationship with the combined endpoint (HR=2.05, 95%CI 1.28-3.29). High FXI activity was also associated with an increased risk (HR=1.80, 95%CI 1.09-2.98). Contrarily, high FXII activity was not associated with the combined endpoint (HR=0.86, 95%CI 0.49-1.51). Continuous analyses per standard deviation of each biomarker yielded similar results.
Conclusions: In our study of mild to moderate ischemic stroke patients, high activity levels of FXI and FVIII but not FXII were associated with worse vascular outcomes in the three-year period after first ischemic stroke. This is of special interest in light of the ongoing trials of antithrombotic treatments targeting FXI.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015818v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015818v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Neurology

"Diabetes mellitus, glycemic traits, and cerebrovascular disease: a Mendelian randomization study","Rationale: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is an established risk factor for cerebrovascular disease but the mechanisms underlying this association remain elusive. Disentangling the causal effects of T2D, hyperglycemia, and pre-diabetic phenotypes (insulin resistance, -cell dysfunction) on major etiological stroke subtypes (ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke subtypes) could inform the development of preventive strategies.

Objective: We employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the effects of genetic predisposition to T2D, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and -cell dysfunction on risk of stroke subtypes and related cerebrovascular phenotypes.

Methods and Results: We selected instruments for genetic predisposition to T2D, HbA1c levels, fasting glucose levels, insulin resistance, and -cell dysfunction (proxied by pro-insulin levels) based on published genome-wide association studies (up to 898,130 individuals). Applying two-sample MR, we examined associations with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke subtypes (large artery, cardioembolic, small vessel stroke; up to 60,341 cases and 454,450 controls). We further explored associations with the related phenotypes of carotid atherosclerosis, imaging markers of cerebral white matter integrity, and brain atrophy. Genetic predisposition to T2D and elevated HbA1c levels in the pre-diabetic range were associated with higher risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, carotid plaque and small vessel stroke. Independently of HbA1c levels, we further found genetic predisposition to insulin resistance to be associated with large artery and small vessel stroke, whereas predisposition to -cell dysfunction was associated with small vessel stroke. Predisposition to -cell dysfunction was further associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, lower grey matter volume, and total brain volume.

Conclusions: This study supports causal effects of T2D and hyperglycemia on large artery and small vessel stroke. We show differential effects of genetically determined insulin resistance and -cell dysfunction on large artery and small vessel stroke that might have implications for anti-diabetic treatments targeting these mechanisms.

"Surgical site infection and its associated factors in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Despite being a preventable complication of surgical procedures surgical site infections (SSIs) continue to threaten public health with significant impacts on the patients and the health-care human and financial resources. With millions affected globally,there issignificant variation in the primary studies on the prevalence of SSIs in Ethiopia.  Therefore this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of SSI and its associated factors among postoperative patients in Ethiopia.   
Methods: PubMed Scopus Psyinfo African Journals Online and Google Scholar were searched for studies that looked at SSI in postoperative patients. A funnel plot and Egger s regression test were used to determine publication bias. The I2 statistic was used to check heterogeneity between the studies. DerSimonian and Laird random effects model was applied to estimate the pooled effect size, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence interval (CIs) across studies. The subgroup analysis was conducted by region, sample size, and year of publication.  Sensitivity analysis was deployed to determine  the effect of a single study on the overall estimation. Analysis was done using STATA Version 14 software.
Result: A  total  of  24  studies  with  13,136  study  participants  were  included  in  this  study. The estimated pooled prevalence of SSI in Ethiopia was 12.3% (95% CI: 10.19, 14.42). Duration of surgery > 1 hour (AOR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.08 2.94), diabetes mellitus (AOR = 3.25; 95% CI: 1.51 6.99) American Society of Anaesthesiologists score >1 (AOR = 2.51; 95% CI: 1.07 5.91), previous surgery (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.77 3.53), clean-contaminated wound (AOR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.52 3.04), and preoperative hospital stay > 7 day (AOR = 5.76; 95% CI: 1.15 28.86) were significantly  associated with SSI. 
Conclusion: The prevalence of SSI among postoperative patients in Ethiopia remains high with a pooled prevalence of 12.3% in 24 extracted studies. Therefore situation based interventions and region context-specific preventive strategies should be developed to reduce the prevalence of SSI among postoperative patients.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.25.19015792v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.25.19015792v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Surgery

"Emergence of mcr-9.1 in ESBL-producing Clinical Enterobacteriaceae in Pretoria, South Africa: Global Evolutionary Phylogenomics, Resistome and Mobilome.","Background. Extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are critical-priority pathogens that cause substantial fatalities. With the emergence of mobile mcr genes mediating resistance to colistin in Enterobacteriaceae, clinicians are now left with little therapeutic options. 
Methods. Eleven clinical Enterobacteriaceae strains with resistance to cephems and/or colistin were genomically analysed to determine their resistome, mobilome, and evolutionary relationship to global strains. The global phylogenomics of mcr-9.1-bearing genomes were further analysed.  
Results & conclusion. Ten isolates were ESBL positive. The isolates were multidrug-resistant and phylogenetically related to global clones, but distant from local strains. Multiple resistance genes, including blaCTX-M-15 blaTEM-1 and mcr-9.1 were found in single isolates; ISEc9, IS19, and Tn3 transposons bracketed blaCTX-M-15 and blaTEM-1. Common plasmid types included IncF, IncH and ColRNAI. Genomes bearing mcr-9.1 clustered into six main phyletic groups (A-F), with those of this study belonging to clade B. Enterobacter sp. and Salmonella sp. are the main hosts of mcr-9.1 globally, albeit diverse promiscuous plasmids disseminate mcr-9.1 across different bacterial species. Emergence of mcr-9.1 in ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in South Africa is worrying due to the restricted therapeutic options. Intensive One Health molecular surveillance might discover other mcr alleles and inform infection management and antibiotic choices.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.24.19015784v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.24.19015784v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Pathology

"Global Trends of Seroprevalence and Universal Screening Policy for Chagas Disease in Donors: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Screening for Trypanosoma cruzi among blood and organ donors is essential to reduce Chagas disease transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) has prioritised curtailing transmission in blood banks (BBs) and transplantation centres (TCs) by 50% by 2025 and 100% by 2030. This study aims to update the situation on T. cruzi screening strategies in BBs and TCs to evaluate the evolution of seroprevalence and the achievement of screening milestones globally. 

Methods: We used published articles and government reports on seroprevalence data and screening policies in BBs and TCs across the world.  We conducted meta-analyses of T. cruzi seroprevalence estimates by who region, endemicity status, and country, and used meta-regression to identify the covariates influencing the estimates. Publication bias and sensitivity analyses were also conducted. 

Results: Based on 99 studies and reports and found a global pattern of increased universal screening policies (USPs) in BBs from 1990 to 2018. We found information for 50 countries, of which 44 (88%) have implemented USPs and 21 (42%) achieved 100% coverage by 2015. Out of the 21 Chagas-disease endemic countries, 20 are in advanced USP stages, and 18 achieved 100% coverage by 2015. Latin America (LA) was the first region to start USP since the 1990s and 19 countries are in advanced stages of implementation and by 2015 there is evidence of 100% coverage in 15 LA countries. In the Caribbean Region, USPs are still in early implementation stages and by 2015 only five out of 24 countries have achieved 100% coverage. Outside Latin America and the Caribbean, there are USPs only in the USA, which initiated in 2007 and with 100% coverage in 2016. In Europe, there are no USPs, but some countries have implemented selective screening of at-risk donors in the UK, Spain, France and Switzerland. Whereas Sweden and Italy have implemented a deferral system. For TCs, national guidelines have been produced in some European countries since the 2000s; in the USA, USPs started since 2002, but 100% coverage is yet to be achieved.  There is a global decrease in T. cruzi seroprevalence among blood donors from the 1970s to 2010s, particularly in endemic countries, where the T. cruzi pooled seroprevalence decreased from 2.42% (95% CI 0.75%-7.53%) in the 1970s to 0.38% (95% CI 0.30%-0.60%) in the 2010s. Seroprevalence in non-endemic countries has remained relatively stable between 1990s and 2010s around 0.01% (95% CI 0.01%-0.03%). Country and decade were identified as the two major predictors of seroprevalence in BBs. Data on TCs was scarce.

Interpretation: Despite global progress in T. cruzi screening policies, both USPs and 100% coverage are yet to be achieved. Seroprevalence in BBs have decreased in endemic countries, likely due to a combination of vector control, increased USPs and voluntary donation, and improved diagnosis. To achieve the proposed WHO goals by 2025 and 2030, USPs in TCs must become available in all endemic countries. In BBs, USPs should be a priority in the Caribbean region as well as non-endemic countries where migration from endemic countries is important.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.25.19015776v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.25.19015776v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Epidemiology

"Genetics of Height and Risk of Atrial Fibrillation: A Mendelian Randomization Study","Objective: To determine whether height has a causal effect on risk of atrial fibrillation
Design: Mendelian randomization study
Setting: Genome-wide association studies of height and atrial fibrillation; Penn Medicine Biobank
Participants: Multiethnic (predominantly European ancestry) participants in genome-wide association studies of height (693,529 individuals) and atrial fibrillation (65,446 cases and 522,744 controls); 7,023 Penn Medicine Biobank participants of European ancestry 
Exposures: Height, cardiometabolic risk factors for atrial fibrillation, and randomly allocated genetic variants strongly associated with these traits
Main outcome measure: Risk of atrial fibrillation (measured in odds ratio)
Results: At the population level, a 1 standard deviation increase in genetically-predicted height was associated with increased odds of AF (Odds ratio [OR] 1.34; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.29 to 1.40; p = 5x10-42). These findings remained consistent in sensitivity analyses that were robust to the presence of pleiotropic variants. Results from analyses considering individual-participant data were similar, even after adjustment for clinical covariates, including left atrial size.
Conclusions: Genetically predicted height is a positive causal risk factor for AF. This finding raises the possibility of investigating height/growth-related pathways as a means for gaining novel mechanistic insights to atrial fibrillation, as well as incorporating height into population screening strategies for atrial fibrillation.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.23.19015743v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.23.19015743v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Hospital admission with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with increased all-cause mortality independent of cardiovascular risk factors","Background:
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common and strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome. Though NAFLD may progress to end-stage liver disease, the top cause of mortality in NAFLD is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most of the data on liver-related mortality in NAFLD derives from specialist liver centres. We aimed to assess mortality in NAFLD when adjusting for CVD in a real world cohort of inpatients.

Methods:
Retrospective study of hospitalised patients with 14-years follow-up. NAFL (non-alcoholic fatty liver), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and NAFLD-cirrhosis groups were defined by ICD-10 codes using ACALM methodology. Cases were age-/sex-matched 1:10 with non-NAFLD hospitalised patients from the ACALM registry. All-cause mortality was compared between groups using cox regression adjusted for CVD and metabolic syndrome risk factors.

Results:
We identified 1238 patients with NAFL, 105 with NASH and 1235 with NAFLD-cirrhosis. There was an increasing burden of cardiovascular disease with progression from NAFL to NASH to cirrhosis. After adjustment for demographics, metabolic syndrome components and cardiovascular disease, patients with NAFL, NASH, and cirrhosis all had increased all-cause mortality (HR 1.3 (CI 1.1-1.5), HR 1.5 (CI 1.0-2.3) and HR 3.5 (CI 3.3-3.9), respectively). Hepatic decompensation (NAFL HR 8.0 (CI 6.1-10.4), NASH HR 6.5 (2.7-15.4) and cirrhosis HR 85.8 (CI 72-104)), and hepatocellular carcinoma were increased in all NAFLD groups. 

Conclusion:
There is a high burden of cardiovascular disease in NAFLD-cirrhosis patients. From a large real-life non-specialist registry of hospitalized patients, NAFLD patients have increased overall mortality and rate of liver-related complications compared to controls after adjusting for cardiovascular disease.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.24.19015750v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.24.19015750v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Gastroenterology

"Home Use of a Wireless Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface by Individuals With Tetraplegia","Individuals with neurological disease or injury such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury or stroke may become tetraplegic, unable to speak or even locked-in. For people with these conditions, current assistive technologies are often ineffective. Brain-computer interfaces are being developed to enhance independence and restore communication in the absence of physical movement. Over the past decade, individuals with tetraplegia have achieved rapid on-screen typing and point-and-click control of tablet apps using intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) that decode intended arm and hand movements from neural signals recorded by implanted microelectrode arrays. However, cables used to convey neural signals from the brain tether participants to amplifiers and decoding computers and require expert oversight during use, severely limiting when and where iBCIs could be available for use. Here, we demonstrate the first human use of a wireless broadband iBCI. Based on a prototype system previously used in pre-clinical research, we replaced the external cables of a 192-electrode iBCI with wireless transmitters and achieved high-resolution recording and decoding of broadband field potentials and spiking activity from people with paralysis. Two participants in an ongoing pilot clinical trial performed on-screen item selection tasks to assess iBCI-enabled cursor control. Communication bitrates were equivalent between cabled and wireless configurations. Participants also used the wireless iBCI to control a standard commercial tablet computer to browse the web and use several mobile applications. Within-day comparison of cabled and wireless interfaces evaluated bit error rate, packet loss, and the recovery of spike rates and spike waveforms from the recorded neural signals. In a representative use case, the wireless system recorded intracortical signals from two arrays in one participant continuously through a 24-hour period at home. Wireless multi-electrode recording of broadband neural signals over extended periods introduces a valuable tool for human neuroscience research and is an important step toward practical deployment of iBCI technology for independent use by individuals with paralysis. On-demand access to high-performance iBCI technology in the home promises to enhance independence and restore communication and mobility for individuals with severe motor impairment.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.27.19015727v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.27.19015727v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Neurology

"Undetectable free aromatic amino acids in nails of breast carcinoma: Biomarkers discovery by a novel metabolite purification VTGE system","BACKGROUND: Metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer is depicted as a crucial change in the tumor microenvironment. Besides the molecular understanding of metabolic heterogeneity, appreciable attentions are drawn to characterize metabolite profiles in tumor tissue and derived biological fluids and tissue materials. Several findings reported on the metabolic alterations of free aromatic amino acids (FAAAs) and other metabolites in biological fluids. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in the development of a suitable method for the purification and analysis of metabolite biomarkers in nails of cancer patients. 

METHODS: To address the metabolite alterations specifically FAAAs level in nails, fingernail clippings of breast cancer patients (N=10), and healthy subjects (N-12) were used for extraction and purification of metabolites. Here, we report a novel and specifically designed vertical tube gel electrophoresis (VTGE) system that helped for the purification of metabolites in the range of (100-1000 Da) from nail materials. The claimed VTGE system uses 15% polyacrylamide under non-denaturing and non-reducing conditions that makes eluted metabolites directly compatible with LC-HRMS and other analytical techniques. Qualitative and quantitative determination of FAAAs in nail lysates were done by positive ESI mode of Agilent LC-HRMS platform. 

RESULTS: 
The analysis on collected data of nail metabolites clearly suggests that FAAAs including tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine and histidine are undetectable in nail lysates of breast cancer over healthy subjects. This is a first report that shows the highly reduced levels of FAAAs in nails of breast cancer. Furthermore, present observation is in consonance with previous findings that support that breast cancer patients show cancer cachexia, high amino acid catabolism that drive metabolite driven cancer growth and proliferation. 

CONCLUSION: This paper provides a proof of concept for a novel and specifically developed VTGE process that assisted to show the first evidence on undetectable level of FAAAs in nails of breast cancer patients as metabolite biomarkers. Here, the authors propose the potential use of VTGE assisted process to achieve metabolomic discovery in nails of breast cancer and other tumor types.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.22.19015669v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.22.19015669v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Oncology

"Timing and nature of palliative care discussions are patient-specific according to clinicians: a qualitative study","Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with an unpredictable and complex disease trajectory. Consequently, most patients are not involved in advance care planning and do not receive palliative care until the end of life.
Aim: To explore clinicians experiences, opinions and recommendations for the timing and nature of palliative care discussions in COPD. 
Design: Qualitative interviews with nurses and doctors that provide direct care to COPD patients.
Setting/Participants: 14 clinicians working across primary and secondary care in the UK were interviewed.
Results: Participants suggested that those with the appropriate expertise and an established relationship with patients were best placed to initiate discussions about palliative and future care. Early, gradual and informed palliative and future care discussions were considered best practice, however they uncommon occurrence due to service, patient and clinician-related barriers. The unpredictable disease trajectory and fine balance between providing acute care and discussing palliative care options were suggested as key greatest barriers for discussions. However, damaging patient hope was a concern for clinicians and reduced their inclination to discuss palliative care. Clinicians did not seem to think that patients were ready for discussions, therefore they avoided broaching the subject leading early in the disease trajectory. 
Conclusion: Stand-alone conversations about and near the end of life was described as current usual practice by clinicians, however individualised early, regular and gradual discussions with patients about immediate and long-term future plans may make such discussions feel less negative and ordinary for patients and clinicians.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19013417v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19013417v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Palliative Medicine

"Prospective assessment of DCE-MRI parameters associated with advanced mandibular osteoradionecrosis after IMRT for head and neck cancer","Purpose:
We aim to characterize the quantitative DCE-MRI parameters associated with advanced mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) compared to the contralateral normal mandible. 
Methods:
Patients with the diagnosis of advanced ORN after curative-intent radiation treatment of head and neck cancer were prospectively enrolled after institutional-review board approval and study-specific informed consent. Eligibility criteria included; age>18 years, pathological evidence of head and neck malignancy with history of curative-intent external beam radiotherapy; patients with clinically confirmed high-grade ORN requiring surgical intervention; and no contraindications to MRI. The DCE-MRI acquisition consisted of a variable flip angle T1 mapping sequence and a multi-phase 3D FSPGR sequence. Quantitative maps generated with the Tofts and extended Tofts pharmacokinetic model were used for analysis. Motion correction was applied. Manual segmentation of advanced ORN 3-D volume was done using anatomical sequences (T1, T2, and T1+contrast) to create ORN volumes of interest (ORN-VOIs). Subsequently, normal mandibular VOIs were segmented on the contralateral healthy mandible of similar volume and anatomical location (i.e., mirror image) to create self-control VOIs. Finally, anatomical sequences were co-registered to DCE sequences, and contours were propagated to the respective quantitative parameter maps.
Results:
Thirty patients were included. Median age at diagnosis was 58 years (range 19-78), and 83% were men. The site of tumor origin was in the oropharynx, oral cavity, salivary glands, and nasopharynx in 13, 9, 6, and 2 patients, respectively. The median time to ORN development after completion of IMRT was 38 months (range 6-184). There were statistically significant higher Ktrans and Ve values in ORN-VOIs compared with controls (0.23 vs. 0.07 min-1, and 0.34 vs. 0.15, p <0.0001 for both) using matched pairs analysis. The average relative increase of Ktrans in ORN-VOIs was 3.2 folds healthy mandibular control VOIs. Moreover, the corresponding rise of Ve in ORN-VOIs was 2.7 folds higher than the controls. Using combined Ktrans and Ve parameters, 27 patients (90%) had at least a 200% increase of either of the studied parameters in the ORN-VOIs compared with their healthy mandible control VOIs.  
Conclusion:
Our results confirm there is a quantitatively significant higher degree of leakiness in the mandibular vasculature as measured using DCE-MRI parameters of areas affected with an advanced grade of ORN versus healthy mandible. We were able to measure significant increases in quantitative metrics compared to values from the non-ORN mandibular bone. Further efforts are ongoing to validate these findings to enable the use of these DCE-MRI parameter thresholds for the early detection of subclinical cases of ORN.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.23.19015651v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.23.19015651v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Oncology

"Use of mobile health apps in low-income populations: a prospective study of facilitators and barriers","Background: Mobile applications (apps) are increasingly popular in healthcare. For low-income populations, barriers exist, yet limited data are available about the challenges and catalysts for adoption.
Methods and Results: We partnered with a primary care center and a community organization and recruited patients to use a health app. A community health worker (CHW) consented participants, downloaded the app and instructed on its use, and provided ongoing technical support. Bi-weekly surveys for three months were sent via email/text to assess participant experiences and perceptions.
The majority (81 of 108 [75.0%] English language-preferred and 50 of 52 [96.2%] Spanish language-preferred) of patients approached were enrolled. Common reasons for declining were: did not own a smartphone (13.8%), did not have email (20.7%), and not interested (58.6%). Enrollment challenges included: insufficient storage, unfamiliarity with downloading apps, forgotten passwords to email accounts, and slow/absent WiFi connection - which the CHW and the app company were able to address. Most participants, English and Spanish language-preferred respectively, were interested in monitoring their health through an app (74.4%; 70.4%), connecting devices such as FitBits and blood pressure cuffs (78.9%; 50.0%), and being the owner of their health records (83.6%; 95.6%). There were concerns about sharing health information with research teams (66.7%; 51.9%), and data being sold (83.0%; 70.4%). However, many (58.6%; 87.2%) reported being likely to share health data with a trusted research team. Compared with before the study, most felt more comfortable using health apps (67.4%; 82.1%) and more likely to participate in research using apps (76.2%; 72.4%).
Conclusions: The assistance of a CHW facilitated the enrollment of low-income individuals in a mobile health app by fostering trust and sustained engagement. Participants were interested in having several app features. Despite concerns about data privacy, they demonstrated greater interest in mobile health app use and research participation at study conclusion.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.22.19015636v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.22.19015636v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Health Systems and Quality Improvement

"Identifying groups of people with similar sociobehavioural characteristics in Malawi to inform HIV interventions: a Latent Class Analysis","Background: Within many sub-Saharan African countries including Malawi, HIV prevalence varies widely between regions. This variability may be related to the distribution of population groups with specific sociobehavioural characteristics that influence the transmission of HIV and the uptake of prevention. In this study, we intended to identify groups of people in Malawi with similar risk profiles.

Methods:  We used data from the Demographic and Health Survey in Malawi from 2016, and stratified the analysis by sex. We considered demographic, socio-behavioural and HIV-related variables. Using Latent Class Analysis (LCA), we identified clusters of people sharing common sociobehavioural characteristics. The optimal number of clusters was selected based on the Bayesian information criterion. We compared the proportions of individuals belonging to the different clusters across the three regions and 28 districts of Malawi.

Results:  We found nine clusters of women and six clusters of men. Most women in the clusters with highest risk of being HIV infected were living in female-headed households and were formerly married or in a union. Among men, older men had the highest risk of being HIV infected, followed by young (20-25) single men. Generally, low HIV testing uptake correlated with lower risk of having HIV. However, rural adolescent girls had a low probability of being tested (48.7%) despite a relatively high HIV prevalence. Urban districts and Southern region had a higher percentage of high-prevalence and less tested clusters of individuals than other areas.

Conclusions: LCA is an efficient method to find clusters of people sharing common HIV risk profiles, identify particularly vulnerable population groups, and plan targeted interventions focusing on these groups. Tailored support, prevention and HIV testing programmes should focus particularly on female household heads, adolescent girls living in rural areas, older married men, and young men who have never been married.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015560v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015560v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Public and Global Health

"Bone changes assessed with High-Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) in early inflammatory arthritis: a 12-month cohort study","Objectives: We sought to determine the sensitivity of high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to detect change and identify erosions in comparison with conventional radiography (CR) in early inflammatory arthritis patients. We also explored which prognostic factors contribute to bone damage assessed by HR-pQCT in the first year of diagnosis.
Methods: 46 patients with arthritic symptoms less than one year, and a clinical diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis were prospectively imaged at baseline and 12-months. HR-pQCT scans of the 2nd and 3rd MCP joints and CR of the hands and feet were performed. Joint space width (JSW), total bone mineral density (Tt.BMD), erosion presence and volume were assessed with HR-pQCT. Scan-rescan precision was assessed to define an individual-level least significant change (LSC) criterion. Regression analyses explored prognostic factors for bone damage progression.
Results: We observed no significant group-level changes in JSW, Tt.BMD or erosion volume. 20% or fewer joints demonstrated individual-level changes greater than the LSC criterion for mean JSW, Tt.BMD and erosion volume. HR-pQCT detected more erosions than CR in the 2nd and 3rd MCP. Increased symptom duration at diagnosis was associated (p < 0.10) with lower JSW minimum and higher JSW standard deviation. 
Conclusions: We have demonstrated stability in erosion, bone density and JSW over 12-months in most patients receiving treatment for inflammatory arthritis using a LSC criterion, although patients with longer symptom duration prior to treatment initiation had demonstrable negative effects on JSW estimates. HR-pQCT captures bone damage and progression undetectable by CR in the imaged joints.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.19015537v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.19015537v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Rheumatology

"Stroke Volume Reserve is an Independent Predictor of Survival and Need for Advanced Therapies in Systolic Heart Failure Patients","Background: We investigated whether stroke volume reserve (STVR) would predict one year mortality and the need for advanced therapies in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients.
Methods and Results: 
We retrospectively studied 104 ambulatory patients with HFrEF (59.2 + 10.2 years, 89% male) referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). At 1 year, 39 outcomes were observed: 16 heart transplants (HTx), 8 left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), and 15 deaths. Stroke volume (SV) was determined by the Fick principle with established values for C[a v]O2 at rest and anaerobic threshold (AT). STVR was calculated by SVAT/SVrest. Multi-predictor regression showed a correlation of STVR<1.3 (OR 7.92, p=0.002), cardiac index by right heart catheterization<2 (OR 3.07, p=0.049), and peak VO2 below the ISHLT cut off (OR 4.09, p=0.011). HFrEF patients with a peak VO2 above the ISHLT cut off but STVR<1.3 showed similar survival as patients with low peak VO2 less than the ISHLT cut off. A scoring system was developed: STVR<1.3:2 points, peak VO2 below the ISHLT cut off:1 point, and cardiac index<2: 1 point. A score of >3 demonstrated a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 79% for 1 year events. 
Conclusions: STVR is a novel parameter that may better predict 1 year outcomes than peak VO2 in HFrEF patients.

"Host biomarkers to predict the severity of acute febrile illness: A scoping review","Background: Acute febrile illness (AFI) ranges from mild to mortal, yet severity is difficult to assess. Host biomarkers may identify patients with AFI who require a higher level of care; choosing appropriate biomarkers for this role among an expanding pool of candidates is challenging. We performed a scoping review to evaluate the performance of novel host biomarkers to predict AFI severity.
Methods: PubMed was systematically searched for manuscripts published January 1, 2013 to February 10, 2018 for studies reporting the association of host biomarker levels and a measure of disease severity among patients with a suspected or diagnosed cause of AFI. Identified abstracts and full text manuscripts were reviewed for eligibility by 2 reviewers. Biomarker performance was evaluated primarily by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic to distinguish severe disease. We aggregated data describing biomarker performance by AUC using weighted mean, fixed effects meta-analyses, and random effects meta-analyses.
Results: Among 2,303 manuscripts identified, 281 manuscripts met criteria for analysis. Data was extracted for 278 biomarkers evaluated in 45,737 participants. Among 89 biomarkers evaluated by =2 studies, there were 6 biomarkers (proadrenomedullin, copeptin, pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, serum triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1, chitinase-3-like protein-1, and the pediatric sepsis biomarker risk model), that showed a weighted mean AUC >0.75 (range 0.75-0.84) in >500 patients over >2 studies.
Conclusions: Although several biomarkers show promise in predicting AFI severity across multiple studies, their test characteristics do not suggest that they may be used alone to determine AFI prognosis.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.21.19014753v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.21.19014753v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Genetic-Ancestry Analysis on >93,000 Individuals Undergoing Expanded Carrier Screening Reveals Limitations of Ethnicity-Based Medical Guidelines","Purpose: Despite strong association between genetic ancestry and carrier status, current carrier-screening guidelines recommend testing for a limited set of conditions based on patient self-reported ethnicity, which conflates genetic and cultural factors.
Materials and Methods: For 93,419 individuals undergoing a 96-gene expanded carrier screen (ECS), correspondence was assessed among carrier status, self-reported ethnicity, and a dual-component genetic ancestry (e.g., 75% African/25% European) calculated from sequencing data. 
Results: Self-reported ethnicity was an imperfect indicator of genetic ancestry, with 9% of individuals having >50% genetic ancestry from a lineage inconsistent with self-reported ethnicity. Self-reported ethnicity-based carrier-screening guidelines are incomplete, as several conditions not included in guidelines had similarly strong correlation between carrier rate and genetic ancestry as conditions included in screening guidelines. Limitations of self-reported ethnicity led to missed carriers in at-risk populations: for 10 ECS conditions, patients with intermediate genetic ancestry backgrounds (who did not self-report the associated ethnicity) had significantly elevated carrier risk. Finally, for seven of the 16 conditions included in current screening guidelines, most carriers were not from the population the guideline aimed to serve.
Conclusion: To provide equitable reproductive care, guidelines should discontinue the use of ethnicity as a basis for determining which patients are appropriate for carrier screening and instead recommend pan-ethnic ECS.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.21.19015578v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.21.19015578v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Metagenomic Study Revealed the Potential Role of the Gut Microbiome in Gout","Emerging evidence has indicated an association between the gut microbiome and arthritis diseases including gout. This metagenomic study aims to investigate the possible role of gut microbiota in the development of gout. The results exhibit gout patients have higher abundance of Prevotella, Fusobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp., whereas healthy controls have higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae spp., butyrate-producing species, including Roseburia spp., Butyrivibrio spp. and Coprococcus spp. and anti-inflammatory Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Functional analysis shows gut microbiome of gout patients have higher potential for fructose, mannose metabolism and lipid A biosynthesis, but lower potential for urate degradation and SCFAs production. Enterobacteriaceae spp. may contribute to urate degradation and provide immunostimulatory effect in healthy controls. A disease classifier based on gut microbiota shows positive performance in the discovery and validation cohorts (93.03% and 89.13% accuracy, respectively). The effect of uric-acid-lowering and anti-inflammatory drugs on the gut microbiome is mild. Integrative analyses of four additional diseases (obesity, type 2 diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis) indicates gout seems to be more similar to autoimmune diseases than metabolic diseases. This work demonstrates an altered gut microbiota might influence the development of gout and provides new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.21.19014142v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.21.19014142v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Rheumatology

"Pilot assessment of low NK cell-mediated ADCC and FCGR3A genetics in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS): Based on inclusion of family members without ME/CFS as controls, low ADCC is unsuitable as a diagnostic biomarker","ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) is dependent on the varying capacity of NK cells to kill, the affinities of FCGR3A-encoded CD16A receptors for antibody, and the presence of antigen-specific antibodies.  In vivo ADCC depends on the number of CD16A receptor-positive NK cells in blood. We hypothesized that low ADCC cell function or low effector cell numbers could be biomarkers or risk factors for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). We measured NK cell ADCC lytic capacity and antibody recognition, CD16Apositive NK cells/ul blood, and FCGR3A homozygosity for the F allele that encodes low affinity CD16A antibody receptors. ME/CFS patients met the Fukuda 1994 diagnostic criteria. In this pilot report, we examined 5 families, each with 2 to 5 ME/CFS patients, and compared 11 patients, 22 family members without ME/CFS, and 16 unrelated healthy controls. ADCC was measured as CX1:1 cytotoxic capacity (the percentage of 51Cr-Daudi tumors with obinutuzumab anti-CD20 antibody that were killed at a 1:1 ratio of CD16Apos NKs to Daudis) and CX-slope. Individual CX1:1 capacities varied from 16.2% to 81.8% and were comparable between patients and unaffected family members, while the ADCC of both family groups was lower than the unrelated healthy controls. The lack of difference between patients and their unaffected family members indicates that low ADCC is unsuitable as a diagnostic biomarker for ME/CFS. Familial CD16Apos NK blood cell counts were lower than unrelated healthy controls. The potential for synergistic effects of combined low CX1:1 and low effector cell counts occurring in the same individual was 24-fold greater for CFS family members than for unrelated controls. FCGR3A of the families was predominantly F/F homozygous, correlating with the observed low EC50 for NK recognition of target cell-bound antibody. In summary, low ADCC is unsuitable as a biomarker, but could be a familial risk factor, for ME/CFS.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.19015438v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.19015438v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Allergy and Immunology

"Machine learning suggests polygenic contribution to cognitive dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multi-system disorder characterized by progressive muscular weakness and, in addition, cognitive/behavioral dysfunction in nearly 50% of patients. The mechanisms underlying risk for cognitive dysfunction, however, remain elusive. Using sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA), an unsupervised machine-learning technique, we observed that 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms collectively associate with baseline cognitive performance in 330 ALS patients from the multicenter Clinical Research in ALS and Related Disorders for Therapeutic Development (CReATe) consortium. We demonstrate that a polygenic risk score derived from sCCA relates to longitudinal cognitive decline in the same cohort, and also to in vivo cortical thinning (N=80) and post mortem burden of TDP-43 pathology in the middle frontal and motor cortices (N=55) in independent validation cohorts of patients with sporadic ALS. Our findings suggest that common genetic polymorphisms contribute to the manifestation of cognitive dysfunction and disease vulnerability in a polygenic manner in ALS.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.23.19014407v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.23.19014407v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Neurology

"Use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in applied health research: review and recommendations","BACKGROUND: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are an increasingly popular approach for identifying confounding variables that require adjustment when estimating causal effects. This review examined the use of DAGs in applied health research to inform recommendations for improving their transparency and utility in future research.

METHODS: Original health research articles published during 1999-2017 mentioning ""directed acyclic graphs"" or similar or citing DAGitty were identified from Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, and Embase. Data were extracted on the reporting of: estimands, DAGs, and adjustment sets, alongside the characteristics of each article's largest DAG.

RESULTS: A total of 234 articles were identified that reported using DAGs. A fifth (n=48, 21%) reported their target estimand(s) and half (n=115, 48%) reported the adjustment set(s) implied by their DAG(s). Two-thirds of the articles (n=144, 62%) made at least one DAG available. Diagrams varied in size but averaged 12 nodes (IQR: 9-16, range: 3-28) and 29 arcs (IQR: 19-42, range: 3-99). The median saturation (i.e. percentage of total possible arcs) was 46% (IQR: 31-67, range: 12-100). 37% (n=53) of the DAGs included unobserved variables, 17% (n=25) included super-nodes (i.e. nodes containing more than one variable, and a 34% (n=49) were arranged so the constituent arcs flowed in a consistent direction.

CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variation in the use and reporting of DAGs in applied health research. Although this partly reflects their flexibility, it also highlight some potential areas for improvement. This review hence offers several recommendations to improve the reporting and use of DAGs in future research.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.19015511v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.19015511v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Epidemiology

"The association of neurofibromatosis and autism symptomatology is confounded by behavioral problems","Aim: to evaluate if autism symptoms and diagnoses are raised in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), to which levels, and to determine if co-occurring symptomatology accounts for this elevation. Method: We interrogated our hospital electronic medical records. We collected parental reports of autism symptomatology, adaptive behavior, and co-occurring behavioral and emotional problems on a subsample of 45 children (9 years 2 months, 49% male). Age- and sex-matched controls with (N=180) or without ASD (N=180) were drawn from the Simons Simplex Collection and compared cross-sectionally to participants with NF1. Results Diagnoses of ADHD (8.8%), not of ASD (2.1%), were raised among 968 children with NF1 identified through electronic search. Mean Social Responsiveness Score (55.9) was below the cut-off of 60 for significant autism symptoms. Participants with NF1 had significantly more autism and behavioral symptoms than typically developing (TD) controls, and significantly less than controls with autism, with one exception: ADHD symptom levels were similar to those of autistic controls.  When emotional, ADHD, and communication scores were covaried, the difference between participants with NF1 and TD controls disappeared almost entirely. Interpretation: Our results do not support an association between NF1 and autism, both at the symptom and disorder levels.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.19015420v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.19015420v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Travel time to health facilities as a marker of geographical accessibility across heterogeneous land coverage in Peru","The geographical accessibility to health facilities is conditioned by the topography and environmental conditions overlapped with different transport facilities between rural and urban areas. To better estimate the travel time to the most proximate health facility infrastructure and determine the differences across heterogeneous land coverage types, this study explored the use of a novel cloud-based geospatial modeling approach and use as a case study the unique geographical and ecological diversity in the Peruvian territory. Geospatial data of 145,134 cities and villages and 8,067 health facilities in Peru were gathered with land coverage types, roads infrastructure, navigable river networks, and digital elevation data to produce high-resolution (30 m) estimates of travel time to the most proximate health facility across the country. This study estimated important variations in travel time between urban and rural settings across the 16 major land coverage types in Peru, that in turn, overlaps with socio-economic profiles of the villages. The median travel time to primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare facilities was 1.9, 2.3, and 2.2 folds higher in rural than urban settings, respectively. Also, higher travel time values were observed in areas with a high proportion of the population with unsatisfied basic needs. In so doing, this study provides a new methodology to estimate travel time to health facilities as a tool to enhance the understanding and characterization of the profiles of accessibility to health facilities in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), calling for a service delivery redesign to maximize high quality of care.","/content/10.1101/19007856v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007856v2.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Public and Global Health

"Dengue Epidemiology in a Brazilian Community","Dengue is a major vector-borne disease and has motivated health surveillance systems to implement various measures to control it. The epidemiological characterization of dengue occurrence in a community is an important step to foster control activities. We carried out an epidemiological study of the notified and confirmed cases of dengue, from 2000 to 2005, in Guarulhos, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A statistical analysis was performed to test the differences, by sex and age, between the database and the individuals of the population. We also performed a time series analysis of the cases from 2000 to 2007. No statistically significant differences (P>0.05) were observed between the proportions for each sex in the data base and in the city population, and in the categories of 15-19 years, 20-24 years, 25-29 years, 55-59 years, 60-64 years and 70-74 years when compared with the corresponding age intervals in the population. In the other age intervals, statistically significant differences were observed (P<0.05). We observed a cyclic variation in the dengue incidence, between 2000 and 2007, with an alternation of two years with a smaller number of cases (2000-2001 and 2004-2005) and two years with a larger number of cases (2002-2003 and 2006-2007). In the seasonality analysis, the number of cases between February and May was higher than the monthly average. Analyzing the spatial distribution of the cases, we observed the process of increasing endemicity of dengue.","/content/10.1101/19011965v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011965v2.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Epidemiology

"Impact of a pilot community pharmacy system redesign on reducing over-the-counter medication misuse in older adults","Objectives: This pilot study examines effectiveness of an innovative pharmacy design change on over-the-counter (OTC) medication misuse in older adults (ages over 64).  Few interventions have attempted to decrease older adult OTC misuse, and none have addressed system barriers.  A structural redesign of the pharmacy (the Senior Section) was conceptualized to increase awareness of higher-risk OTC medications.  The Senior Section contains a curated selection of OTC medications (for pain, cough/cold, allergy, sleep) and is close to the prescription department to facilitate pharmacy staff/patient engagement to reduce misuse.

Methods: A pre-/post-implementation design was used to recruit 87 older adults from three pharmacies.  Using a hypothetical scenario, participants selected an OTC medication, which was compared to their medication list and health conditions, and their reported use was compared against the product labeling.  Four misuse outcomes were determined: (1) Drug/Drug, (2) Drug/Disease, (3) Drug/Age, and (4) Drug/Label with five sub-types.  Patient characteristics were collected and compiled into a propensity-score matching logistic regression model to estimate their effects on the Senior Section's association with misuse outcomes at pre-/post-implementation.

Results: Patient characteristic were uniform between pre-/post-implementation and, once entered into a propensity-score matching model, Drug/Disease Misuse significantly lessened over time (z=-2.09, p=0.037).  The Senior Section reduced Drug/Drug Misuse, but not significantly.  Drug/Label Misuse varied according to the sub-type, with reduced Daily-Dosage (z=-2.42, p=0.016) and Single-Dosage misuse (z=-5.82, p=0.001); however, Timing/Frequency misuse increased (z=2.16, p=0.031).

Conclusions: These nascent outcomes support a well-conceived pharmacy-based OTC aisles redesign as valuable for reducing older adult OTC medication misuse.  The Senior Section, when broadly implemented, would create new permanent structures and processes to assist older adults in accessing risk information for confidently selecting safer OTC medications.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19014886v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19014886v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Geriatric Medicine

"Cannabidivarin for the treatment of HIV-associated neuropathic pain: a randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trial","Background: HIV remains a major burden to the health care system and neuropathic pain is the most common neurological complication of HIV-infection. Since current treatment strategies often lack satisfying pain relief, cannabinoids are discussed as a new option. We investigated Cannabidivarin as treatment for HIV-associated neuropathic pain. 
Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Patients underwent two successive treatment phases (4 weeks each) and were treated with Cannabidivarin (400mg/d) or placebo in a randomized order. A 3-week wash-out phase was designed to eliminate potential carry-overeffects and patients were followed up for 3 weeks after the end of the second treatment phase. The primary endpoint was pain intensity on an 11-point numeric rating scale and was recorded in a diary. Secondary endpoints were additional pain medication, pain characteristics and quality of life. 
Results: We included 32 (31 male) patients. The mean pain intensity under Cannabidivarin was by 0.62 points higher compared to placebo (p=0.16; 95% CI -0.27 to 1.51). Cannabidivarin did not influence the amount of additional pain medication, pain characteristics or quality of life. No suspected unexpected adverse reactions occurred during the trial. 
Discussion: Cannabidivarin was safe but failed to reduce neuropathic pain intensity in HIV-patients. This may be explained by a lack of cannabinoid receptor activation, as indicated by preclinical experiments. Further studies on larger sample sizes are needed.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.19015495v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.19015495v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Pain Medicine

"Forecasting Cycles of Seizure Likelihood","Objective: Seizure unpredictability is rated as one of the most challenging aspects of living with epilepsy. Seizure likelihood can be influenced by a range of environmental and physiological factors that are difficult to measure and quantify. However, some generalizable patterns have been demonstrated in seizure onset. A majority of people with epilepsy exhibit circadian rhythms in their seizure times and many also show slower, multiday patterns. Seizure cycles can be measured using a range of recording modalities, including self-reported electronic seizure diaries. This study aimed to develop personalized forecasts from a mobile seizure diary app.
Methods:  Forecasts based on circadian and multiday seizure cycles were tested pseudo-prospectively using data from 33 app users (mean of 103 seizures per subject). Individual's strongest cycles were estimated from their reported seizure times and used to derive the likelihood of future seizures. The forecasting approach was validated using self-reported events and electrographic seizures from the Neurovista dataset, an existing database of long-term electroencephalography that has been widely used to develop forecasting algorithms.
Results: The validation dataset showed that forecasts of seizure likelihood based on self-reported cycles were predictive of electrographic seizures. Forecasts using only mobile app diaries allowed users to spend an average of 62.8% of their time in a low-risk state, with 16.6% of their time in a high-risk warning state. On average, 64.5% of seizures occurred during high-risk states and less than 10% of seizures occurred in low-risk states. 
Significance: Seizure diary apps can provide personalized forecasts of seizure likelihood that are accurate and clinically relevant for electrographic seizures. These results have immediate potential for translation to a prospective seizure forecasting trial using a mobile diary app. It is our hope that  seizure forecasting apps will one day give people with epilepsy greater confidence in managing their daily activities.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015453v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015453v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Neurology

"A public health approach to cervical cancer screening in Africa through community-based self-administered HPV testing and mobile treatment provision","Background: Sub-Saharan Africa bears the world's highest incidence of cervical cancer.  To address the lack of widespread screening and treatment that contributes to this burden, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that low-resource countries adopt simplified protocols for screening directly coupled with treatment.  The WHO recommendations present an opportunity -- akin to what has been done for HIV care in Africa -- for a true public health approach to cervical cancer control in resource-poor settings.  We evaluated the feasibility of such a public health approach to cervical cancer that features community-based self-administered HPV screening and mobile treatment provision. 

Methods: In two rural districts of western Uganda, we first trained Village Health Team members (VHTs, also known as Community Health Workers) in a one-day session in the fundamental aspects of cervical cancer and its prevention.  We then provided guidance to the VHTs to mobilize adult women from different communities within the district to attend a one-day HPV screening fair at a central location in their respective community.  On the day of the fair, the study team and VHTs provided educational talks and instructions for self-collection of a vaginal sample.  The samples were subsequently tested for high risk HPV (hrHPV) E6/E7 mRNA using the APTIMA platform.  Women who tested positive for hrHPV were re-contacted and referred for treatment with cryotherapy at a mobile treatment unit in their community.  Visual assessment with acetic acid was used to guide suitability for cryotherapy in the mobile treatment unit versus further referral to a larger facility for a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).  

Results: Between March and November 2016, 2,142 women attended a health fair in one of 24 communities in rural Western Uganda and expressed interest in being screened for cervical cancer; 1902 were eligible for cervical cancer screening of which 1,892 (99.5%) provided a self-collected vaginal sample.  The median age of those screened was 34 years (IQR: 28-40), HIV prevalence was 11%, and most (95%) had not been previously screened.  Almost all women stated that they would perform the self-collection again and recommend it to a friend.  Prevalence of any hrHPV mRNA was 21% (HPV-16, 6%; HPV-18/45, 1.9%).  Among the 393 women with detectable hrHPV mRNA, 89% had their results transmitted to them, of whom 86% returned to the mobile treatment unit.  At the mobile treatment, 85% of women underwent ablative therapy, with the remainder deferred either because of pregnancy (9.0%), need for LEEP (2.6%) or other reasons (3.3%).  

Conclusion:  A public health approach to cervical cancer screening, featuring community-based self-administered HPV testing and mobile treatment, was feasible and readily accepted by community women.  The process is termed a ""public health approach"" because -- as is the case for HIV care in the region -- it explicitly concedes perfection at the individual level in deference to reaching a larger fraction of the population.  The findings support further optimization and evaluation of this approach as a means of scaling up cervical cancer control in low resource settings.  If resources for cancer control remain limited in sub-Saharan Africa, this public approach may offer one of the most efficient solutions for stemming the incessant tide of cervical cancer in the region.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015446v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015446v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Oncology

"An integrative machine learning approach to discovering multi-level molecular mechanisms of obesity using data from monozygotic twin pairs","We combined clinical, cytokine, genomic, methylation and dietary data from 43 young adult monozygotic twin pairs (aged 22  36, 53% female), where 25 of the twin pairs were substantially weight discordant (delta BMI > 3kg/ m2). These measurements were originally taken as part of the TwinFat study, a substudy of The Finnish Twin Cohort study. These five large multivariate data sets (comprising 42, 71, 1587, 1605 and 63 variables, respectively) were jointly analysed using an integrative machine learning method called Group Factor Analysis (GFA) to offer new hypotheses into the multi-molecular-level interactions associated with the development of obesity. New potential links between cytokines and weight gain are identified, as well as associations between dietary, inflammatory and epigenetic factors. This encouraging case study aims to enthuse the research community to boldly attempt new machine learning approaches which have the potential to yield novel and unintuitive hypotheses.

"Immunologic and epidemiologic drivers of norovirus transmission in daycare and school outbreaks","Background: Norovirus outbreaks are notoriously explosive, with dramatic symptomology and rapid disease spread. Children are particularly vulnerable to infection and drive norovirus transmission due to their high contact rates with each other and the environment. Despite the explosive nature of norovirus outbreaks, attack rates in schools and daycares remain low with the majority of students not reporting symptoms. 
Methods: We explore immunologic and epidemiologic mechanisms that may underlie epidemic norovirus transmission dynamics using a disease transmission model. Towards this end, we compared different model scenarios, including innate resistance and acquired immunity (collectively denoted 'immunity'), stochastic extinction, and an individual exclusion intervention. We calibrated our model to daycare and school outbreaks from national surveillance data.
Results: Recreating the low attack rates observed in daycare and school outbreaks required a model with immunity. However, immunity alone resulted in shorter duration outbreaks than what was observed. The addition of individual exclusion (to the immunity model) extended outbreak durations by reducing the amount of time that symptomatic people contribute to transmission. Including both immunity and individual exclusion mechanisms resulted in simulations where both attack rates and outbreak durations were consistent with surveillance data.
Conclusions: The epidemiology of norovirus outbreaks in daycare and school settings cannot be well described by a simple transmission model in which all individuals start as fully susceptible. Interventions should leverage population immunity and encourage more rigorous individual exclusion to improve venue-level control measures.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015396v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015396v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Epidemiology

"The effects of polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders and smoking behaviour on psychotic experiences in UK Biobank","While psychotic experiences are core symptoms of mental health disorders like schizophrenia, they are also reported by 5-10% of the population. Both smoking behaviour and genetic risk for psychiatric disorders have been associated with psychotic experiences, but the interplay between these factors remains poorly understood. We tested whether smoking status, maternal smoking around birth, and number of packs smoked/year were associated with lifetime occurrence of three psychotic experiences phenotypes: delusions (n=2067), hallucinations (n=6689), and any psychotic experience (delusions or hallucinations; n=7803) in 144818 UK Biobank participants. We next calculated polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia (PRSSCZ), major depression (PRSDEP) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (PRSADHD) in the UK Biobank participants to assess whether association between smoking and psychotic experiences was attenuated after adjustment of diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and the PRSs. Finally, we investigated whether smoking exacerbates the effects of genetic predisposition on the psychotic phenotypes in gene-environment interaction models. Smoking status, maternal smoking, and number of packs smoked/year were significantly associated with psychotic experiences (p<1.77x10-5). Except for packs smoked/year, effects were attenuated but remained significant after adjustment for diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and PRSs (p<1.99x10-3). Gene-environment interaction models showed the effects of PRSDEP and PRSADHD (but not PRSSCZ) on delusions (but not hallucinations) were significantly greater in current smokers compared to never smokers (p<0.0028). There were no significant gene-environment interactions for maternal smoking nor for number of packs smoked/year. Our results suggest that both genetic risk of psychiatric disorders and smoking status may have independent and synergistic effects on specific types of psychotic experiences.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015339v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015339v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Estimation of Quasi-Continuous Blood Pressure based on Harmonic Phase-Shifts in Signals using Non-Invasive Photoplethysmographic Measurements","According to the guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol revision 2010, the requirements for long time blood pressure measurement (BPM) are: simple handling, robustness against movements, accuracy of better than 5 mmHg, and, above all, that the patient's motion should not be restricted during measurement. These requirements are in particular important for a reliable interpretation of the blood pressure (BP) of hypertensive patients, because such a diagnosis will usually be confirmed by long-term measurement. Moreover, to be able to correlate the patient's BP with his normal daily activity, non-obstructive non-invasive methods are desired to reduce the patient's load. The main concern of this paper is to present a novel method for estimating non-invasive continuous blood pressure (CBP) from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. In contrast to the pulse transit time (PTT) method, our approach is based on the assumption that the phase-velocities of the fundamental and higher harmonics depend on the (non-linear) elastic properties of the arteries. Consequently, phase velocity varies as a function of a vessel's instantaneous dilation and can be effectively utilised for CBP estimation. In addition to its numerous advantages for a simplified measurement setup, we could show that the method achieves a high degree of correlation for a reliable BP estimation from PPG data. Comparison with state-of-the-art PTT methods was carried out using a dataset from the PhysioBank Database comprising a reference invasive blood pressure (IBP) signal measured at the radial artery, a PPG signal measured at the fingertip and a standard ECG signal. The correlation values obtained from the long-time estimation of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) were as high as r = 0.8945, while the value for the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was found to be r = 0.9082 and the correlation of the mean blood pressure (MBP) was r = 0.9322. These results were achieved by analysing the dataset in a beat-to-beat manner and regarding several post-processing procedures like coherent averaging (CA) and zero padding with quasi-continuous frequency domain estimation and artificially refined frequency resolution.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015321v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015321v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Health Informatics

"Seroprevalence of the hepatitis E virus among blood donors in the Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia","The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV), a major public health issue worldwide with the potential for transmission via blood transfusion, in blood donors in the Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia. Serum samples (n = 1,078) were collected from volunteer blood donors from January to April 2019 and tested for the presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Overall, the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM among blood donors was 5.7% and 1.3%, respectively. Additionally, the seropositive rates of anti-HEV IgG and IgM were significantly higher in non-Saudi donors (22.1% and 7.8%) than in Saudi donors (3% and 0.2%). The seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG increased with age; however, there was no correlation between gender and anti-HEV IgG and/or IgM. The seroprevalence of HEV among blood donors in the Qassim Region was lower than previous estimates for other regions of the country. Further studies covering a wider geographical area are needed to validate and expand the findings and to determine the importance of HEV screening in the region.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015412v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015412v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Socioeconomic inequalities in blood pressure: co-ordinated analysis of 147,775 participants from repeated birth cohort and cross-sectional datasets, 1989 to 2016","Objective: To evaluate whether socioeconomic inequalities in blood pressure (BP) have changed from 1989 to 2016 - a period in which average BP levels declined and the detection and treatment of high BP increased. 
Design Repeated observational studies.
Setting: 3 nationally representative British birth cohort studies - born in 1946, 1958, and 1970 - and 21 nationally representative cross-sectional studies (Health Survey for England 1994 to 2016, HSE).
Participants: 147,775 participants with BP outcomes at age 42-46 years (cohorts) or 25 years and over (HSE).
Main outcome measure: Absolute differences in systolic BP (SBP) by educational attainment (cohorts and HSE) and early life social class (cohorts).
Results: In both datasets, lower education was associated with higher SBP, with similar absolute magnitudes of inequality across the studied period. Differences in SBP by education (Slope Index of Inequality) based on HSE data were 3.0mmHg (95% CI: 1.8, 4.2) in 1994 and 4.3mmHg (2.3, 6.3) in 2016. Findings were similar for diastolic BP (DBP) and survey-defined hypertension. Cohort data suggested that disadvantage in early and adult life had cumulative independent associations with BP: cohort-pooled differences in SBP were 4.9mmHg (3.7, 6.1) in a score combining early life social class and own education, yet were 3.4mmHg (2.4, 4.4) for education alone. In both datasets, inequalities were found across the SBP distribution - below and above hypertension thresholds - yet were larger at the upper tail; in HSE, median SBP differences were 2.8mmHg (1.7, 3.9) yet 5.6mmHg (4.9, 6.4) at the 90th quantile. 
Conclusion: Socioeconomic inequalities in BP have persisted from 1989 to 2016, despite improved detection and treatment of high BP. To achieve future reductions in BP inequalities, policies addressing the wider structural determinants of high BP levels are likely required - targeting detection and treatment alone is unlikely to be sufficient.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015313v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015313v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Epidemiology

"An integrated deep mutational scanning approach provides clinical insights on PTEN genotype-phenotype relationships","Germline variation in PTEN results in variable clinical presentations, including benign and malignant neoplasia and neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite decades of research, it remains unclear how PTEN genotype is related to clinical outcomes. In this study, we combined two recent deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets probing the effects of single-amino acid variation on enzyme activity and steady-state cellular abundance with the largest well-curated clinical cohort of PTEN-variant carriers. We sought to connect variant-specific molecular phenotypes to the clinical outcomes of individuals with PTEN variants. We found that DMS data partially explain quantitative clinical traits, including head circumference and Cleveland Clinic (CC) score, which is a semi-quantitative surrogate of disease burden. We built a logistic regression model using DMS and CADD scores to separate clinical PTEN variation from gnomAD control-only variation with high accuracy (AUC = 0.892). Using a survival-like analysis, we identified molecular phenotype groups with differential risk of early-onset as well as lifetime risk of cancer. Finally, we identified classes of DMS-defined variants with significantly different risk levels for classical hamartoma-related features (odds ratios range of 4.1-102.9). In stark contrast, the risk for developing autism or developmental delay does not significantly change across variant classes (odds ratios range of 5.4-12.4). Together, these findings highlight the potential impact of combining DMS datasets with rich clinical data, and provide new insights that may guide personalized clinical decisions for PTEN-variant carriers.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19015297v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19015297v1.full.pdf","2019-01-02","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Alterations in Brain Morphology by MRI in Adults with NF1","Objective: 

To explore and characterize alterations in brain morphology by MRI in adults with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). 

Methods: 

MRI measurements of 29 intracranial structures were obtained for 389 adults with NF1 and 112 age- and sex-matched unaffected control subjects. A subset of NF1 patients (n = 70) was also assessed for clinical severity of NF1 features and neurological problems and received psychometric testing for attention deficiencies and IQ. Brain morphological measurements were compared between NF1 and control subjects, and correlation analyses were performed between principal components of the intracranial measurements and clinical and psychometric features. 

Results:

Four of nine corpus callosum measurements were significantly greater in adults with NF1 than in sex- and age-matched controls. All seven brainstem measurements were significantly greater in adults with NF1 than in controls. No robust correlations were observed between the size of these structures and clinical or neuropsychometric assessments.

Conclusions:

Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dysregulation of brain myelin production is an important manifestation of NF1 in adults.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015255v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015255v1.full.pdf","2019-12-31","Neurology

Data on pneumococcal carriage in different age groups, along with data on serotype-specific invasiveness, could help to explain these age-related patterns and their implications for vaccination.

Methods: Using pneumococcal carriage and disease data from Israel, we evaluated the association between serotype-specific IPD in adults and serotype-specific carriage prevalence among children in different age categories, while adjusting for serotype-specific invasiveness. We used a sliding window approach to estimate carriage prevalence using different age groupings. Deviance Information Criterion was used to determine which age groupings of carriage data best fit the adult IPD data. Serotype-specific disease patterns were further evaluated by stratifying IPD data by comorbidity status. 

Results: The relative frequency of serotypes causing IPD differed between adults and children, and also differed between older and younger adults and between adults with and without comorbidities. Serotypes over-represented as causes of IPD in adults were more commonly carried in older children as compared to younger children. In line with this, the serotype-specific frequency of carriage in older children (aged 36-59 months), rather than infants, best correlated with serotype-specific IPD in adults. 

Conclusions: These analyses suggest that older children, rather than infants, are the main drivers of disease patterns in adults. These insights could help in optimizing vaccination strategies to reduce disease burden across all ages.

"Cost of hypertension illness and associated factors among patients attending hospitals in Southwest Shewa Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia.","Background: Hypertension is a common vascular disease and the main risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The impact of hypertension is on the rise in Ethiopia, so that, it is predictable that the cost of healthcare services will further increase in the future. We aimed to estimate the total cost of hypertension illness among patients attending hospitals in Southwest Shewa zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia.
Patients and methods: Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 1-30, 2018. All hypertensive patients who were on treatment and whose age was greater than eighteen years old were eligible for this study. The total cost of hypertension illness was estimated by summing up the direct and indirect costs. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with hypertension costs of illness. 
Results:  Overall, the mean monthly total cost of hypertension illness was US $ 22.3 (95% CI, 21.3-23.3). Direct and indirect costs share 51% and 49% of the total cost, respectively. The mean total direct cost of hypertension illness per patient per month was US $11.39(95% CI, 10.6-12.1). Out of these, drugs accounted of a higher cost (31%) followed by food (25%). The mean total indirect cost per patient per month was US $10.89(95% CI, 10.4-11.4). Educational status, distance from hospital, the presence of companion and the stage of hypertension were predictors of the cost of illness of hypertension. 
Conclusion: The cost of hypertension illness was very high when compared with the mean monthly income of the patients letting patients to catastrophic costs. Therefore, due attention should be given by the government to protect patients from financial hardships.

"National Institute for Health Research Health Informatics Collaborative (NIHR HIC): Development of a Pipeline to Collate Electronic Clinical Data for Viral Hepatitis Research","The National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Informatics Collaborative (HIC) is a programme of infrastructure development across NIHR Biomedical Research Centres (BRCs) in the UK. The aim of the NIHR HIC is to improve the quality and availability of routinely collected clinical data for collaborative, cross-centre research. This is demonstrated through research collaborations in selected therapeutic areas, one of which is viral hepatitis.  
The collaboration in viral hepatitis identified a rich set of data fields, including information on clinical assessment, antiviral treatment, laboratory test results, and health outcomes. Clinical data from different centres were standardised and combined to produce a research-ready dataset; this was used to generate insights regarding disease prevalence and treatment response.  
A comprehensive database and governance framework has been developed for potential viral hepatitis research interests, with a corresponding data dictionary for researchers across the centres. Data for an initial cohort of 960 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections and 1404 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections has been collected. 
For the first time, large prospective cohorts are being formed within NHS secondary care services that will allow research questions to be rapidly addressed using real world data. Interactions with industry partners will help to shape future research and will inform patient-stratified clinical practice. An emphasis on NHS-wide systems interoperability, and the increased utilisation of structured and unstructured data solutions for electronic patient records, is improving access to data for research, service improvement and the reduction of clinical data gaps.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015065v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015065v1.full.pdf","2019-12-30","Health Informatics

"Assessing the effectiveness of a pediatrician-led newborn parenting class on maternal newborn-care knowledge, confidence and anxiety: A nonrandomized controlled trial","Background: The postpartum hospital stay is a unique opportunity for clinicians to educate parents on the importance of promoting early child development. Pediatricians are well positioned to address both medical and developmental concerns during critical periods of development, yet very few parenting interventions are led by pediatricians. Aims: To assess the impact of a novel one-hour long pediatrician-led Newborn Class on maternal knowledge, confidence, and anxiety. Methods: We conducted a nonrandomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the Newborn Class. First-time mothers who delivered a full-term singleton vaginally with no major complications and attended the class were recruited. Mothers who expressed a desire to attend the class but were discharged before a class was offered served as controls. Outcome measures: Maternal self-perceived anxiety and confidence were measured using standardized scales (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults and Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale). Knowledge on newborn care was assessed using a novel scale. Results: A total of 84 participants (intervention n=36, control n=48) were included in the study. Mothers who attended class showed significantly higher levels of knowledge compared to the control group as well as significantly higher parenting confidence levels. No change was observed in the overall level of anxiety. Conclusions: A short pediatrician-led parenting intervention can be an effective tool in improving maternal confidence and newborn care knowledge. Given the importance of the newborn period in establishing healthy developmental trajectories, this cost- and time-effective intervention could be widely implemented to promote early strong mother-infant relationships that foster healthy development.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19014936v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19014936v1.full.pdf","2019-12-30","Pediatrics

"The causes and consequences of Alzheimer's disease: A Mendelian randomization analysis","Objective: To identify causal risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and clarify which may instead be modified by emerging Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.
Method: We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of a polygenic risk score (5x10-8) for Alzheimer's disease with a wide range of phenotypes in the UK Biobank, stratified by age tertiles. We also investigated the association between the polygenic risk score for Alzheimer's disease and previously implicated risk factors. Using two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization, we then estimated the size of causal effects of both previously implicated risk factors and those identified by the PheWAS on the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
Results: Genetic liability for Alzheimer's disease was associated with red blood cell indices and cognitive measures in the youngest age tertile. In the middle and older age tertiles, higher genetic liability for Alzheimer's disease was associated with medical history (e.g. atherosclerosis, use of cholesterol-lowering medications), physical measures (e.g. body fat measures), blood cell indices (e.g. erythrocyte distribution width), cognition (e.g. fluid intelligence score) and lifestyle (e.g. self-reported moderate activity and daytime napping). In follow-up analyses using Mendelian randomization, we replicated established risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (e.g. fluid intelligence score, education) and identified several novel risk factors (e.g. forced vital capacity, self-reported moderate physical activity and daytime napping). 
Conclusion: Genetic liability for Alzheimer's disease is associated with over 160 phenotypes. However, findings from Mendelian randomization analyses imply that most of these associations are likely to be caused by increased genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease or selection, rather than a cause of the disease.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19013847v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19013847v1.full.pdf","2019-12-30","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Changes in dental care behaviour between 2002 and 2012 and its association with complete dentition in men and women in Switzerland","Background: In industrialized countries, the awareness of oral hygiene measures has increased and the number of missing teeth has been decreasing. A higher number of missing teeth was reported by women despite their more intense oral hygiene. The aim of this study was to compare oral hygiene and its association to oral health with a complete dentition in women and men in Switzerland between 2002 and 2012.

Methods: Weighted data from the Swiss-Health-Surveys in 2002 and 2012 were used to quantify the number of missing teeth, the prevalence of prosthetic dental restorations, dental visits and tooth brushing. Sex-stratified logistic regression analysis was performed for subjects aged =65-yrs to assess associations between a complete or functional dentition and dental visits, frequency of tooth brushing and socio-demographic factors. 

Results: In all age groups, the prevalence of dental visits and frequent tooth brushing increased and the prevalence of missing teeth decreased between 2002 and 2012. In 2012, the prevalence of a complete dentition was 87% in men and 85.3% women aged <25-yrs and 8.2% or 15.6% in the =85-yrs old. Prevalence of dental visits varied between 45.2% in the =85-yrs in 2002 and 73.1% in the 55-65-yrs old in 2012 in women and between 26.0% in the =85-yrs in 2002 and 68.1% in the 55-65-yrs old in 2012 in men. Frequent tooth brushing was more often reported by women (87.7%/81.4%) than men (73.5%/65.5%) in 2012 and 2002. Subjects aged =65-yrs, who visited their dentist within the last year, were twice as likely to have a functional dentition compared to subjects not having visited their dentist in the last year (men: 2.10, 1.68-2.63; women: 2.16, 1.73-2.70) in 2012, in 2002 this association was even stronger. A complete dentition was also associated with high income, higher education and non-smoking in 2012 in men and women. 

Conclusion: In women and men, oral hygiene practices improved and the mean number of missing teeth substantially decreased between 2002 and 2012. Although women followed oral hygiene recommendations more closely than men, they still do not have a higher prevalence of a complete dentition, except in the oldest age groups.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014878v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014878v1.full.pdf","2019-12-30","Dentistry and Oral Medicine

"Influence of socioeconomic factors on cancer incidence and stage of melanoma in China","Background: Although a high socioeconomic status (SES) was considered as an established risk factor for melanoma in western countries and areas, there was limited evidence of the association between SES and melanoma in China. 
Methods: We studied prospectively enrolled primary melanoma patients at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University over a period of 5 years between January 2013 to December 2017. The clinical stage at diagnosis was categorized according to Guidelines of Chinese Society Oncology, Melanoma. SES data were estimated using data from Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the People's Republic of China and National Healthcare Security Administration.
Results: Of 122 patients with pathologic melanoma diagnosed enrolled in this study. 58 (48%) were male and 64 (52%) were female, the mean age was 59.239.91 years and median age was 60.5 years. Patients in 45-59 age group and 60-73 age group tend to have higher cancer incidence compared with other age groups. The acral lentiginous melanoma (48%) was the most common subtype. Patients with low education level (middle school and below) and low monthly household income (<3000CNY) were associated with a greater risk of melanoma. Similar results were indicated for the patients who were unemployed. There were remarkable more patients who had medical insurance diagnosed with melanoma in this study. There was no significant difference on melanoma stage for patients with higher compared to lower education level (p=0.153). For monthly household income, the Fish's exact test indicated no significant difference in melanoma stage with p=0.507. No staging difference was observed between unemployed patients and employed patients (p=0.687). Finally, statistically significant differences in melanoma staging were not indicated by a patient's insurance status (p=0.537).  
Conclusions: For patients enrolled in our study, disadvantaged SES did not substantially lead to an increasing risk of melanoma incidence, and the effect of socioeconomic factors seemed uninfluenced the stage of melanoma.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19013706v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19013706v1.full.pdf","2019-12-30","Oncology

"The Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT): Scientific Context, Study Design, and Progress towards Biomarker Qualification","Clinical research in neurodevelopmental disorders remains reliant upon clinician and caregiver measures. Limitations of these approaches indicate a need for objective, quantitative, and reliable biomarkers to advance clinical research. Extant research suggests the potential utility of multiple candidate biomarkers; however, effective application of these markers in trials requires additional understanding of replicability, individual differences, and intra-individual stability over time. The Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is a multi-site study designed to investigate a battery of electrophysiological (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) indices as candidate biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study complements published biomarker research through: inclusion of large, deeply phenotyped cohorts of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typical development; a longitudinal design; a focus on well-evidenced candidate biomarkers harmonized with an independent sample; high levels of clinical, regulatory, technical, and statistical rigor; adoption of a governance structure incorporating diverse expertise in the ASD biomarker discovery and qualification process; prioritization of open science, including creation of a repository containing biomarker, clinical, and genetic data; and use of economical and scalable technologies that are applicable in developmental populations and those with special needs. The ABC-CT approach has yielded encouraging results, with one measure accepted into the FDA Biomarker Qualification Program to date. Through these advances, the ABC-CT and other biomarker studies in progress hold promise to deliver novel tools to improve clinical trials research in ASD.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19014548v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19014548v1.full.pdf","2019-12-30","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"The relationship between antihypertensive medications and mood disorders: analysis of linked healthcare data for 1.8 million patients.","Background: Recent work suggests that antihypertensive medications may be useful as repurposed treatments for mood disorders. Using large-scale linked healthcare data we investigated whether certain classes of antihypertensive, such as angiotensin antagonists and calcium channel blockers, were associated with reduced risk of new-onset Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder.

Method: Two cohorts of patients treated with antihypertensives were identified from Scottish prescribing (2009-2016) and hospital admission (1981-2016) records. Eligibility for cohort membership was determined by receipt of a minimum of four prescriptions for antihypertensives within a 12-month window. One treatment cohort (n=538,730) included patients with no previous history of mood disorder, whereas the other (n=262,278) included those who did. Both cohorts were matched by age, sex and area deprivation to untreated comparators. Associations between antihypertensive treatment and new-onset MDD or bipolar episodes were investigated using Cox regression.

Results: For patients without a history of mood disorder, antihypertensives were associated with increased risk of new-onset MDD. For angiotensin antagonist monotherapy, the hazard ratio (HR) for new-onset MDD was 1.17 (95%CI 1.04-1.31). Beta blockers' association was stronger (HR 2.68; 95%CI 2.45-2.92), possibly indicating pre-existing anxiety. Some classes of antihypertensive were associated with protection against bipolar disorder, particularly angiotensin antagonists (HR 0.46; 95%CI 0.30-0.70). For patients with a past history of mood disorders, all classes of antihypertensives were associated with increased risk of future episodes of MDD.

Conclusions: There was no evidence that antihypertensive medications prevented new episodes of MDD but angiotensin antagonists may represent a novel treatment avenue for bipolar disorder.","/content/10.1101/19001719v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001719v2.full.pdf","2019-12-30","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"All-cause mortality and causes of death in the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study","Background & Aims: With the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA), mortality rates and causes of death among persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are likely to change over time. However, the emergence of such trends may be delayed by the relatively slow progression of chronic hepatitis C. To date, detailed analyses of cause-specific mortality among HCV-infected persons over time remain limited.

Methods: We evaluated changes in causes of death among the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS) participants, from 2008 to 2016. We analysed risk factors for all-cause and cause-specific mortality, accounting for changes in treatment, fibrosis stage and use of injectable drugs over time. Mortality ascertainment was completed by linking lost-to-follow-up participants to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (SFSO) death registry.

Results: We included 4,700 SCCS participants, of whom 478 died between 2008 and 2016. Linkage to the SFSO death registry substantially improved the information on causes of death (from 42% of deaths with unknown cause to 10% after linkage). Leading causes of death were liver failure (crude death rate 4.4/1000 person-years), liver cancer (3.4/1000 p-yrs) and non-liver cancer (2.8/1000 p-yrs), with an increasing proportion of cancer-related deaths over time. Cause-specific analysis showed that persons with sustained virologic response (SVR) were less at risk for liver-related mortality than those never treated or treated unsuccessfully.

Conclusions: Although the expected decrease in mortality is not yet observable, causes of death among HCV-infected persons evolved over time. With the progressive widening of guidelines for DAA use, liver-related mortality is expected to decline in the future. Continued monitoring of cause-specific mortality will remain important to assess the long-term effect of DAA and to design effective interventions.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014837v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014837v2.full.pdf","2019-12-30","Epidemiology

"Heterogeneity and heterotypic continuity of emotional and behavioral profiles across development","Objective: To identify profiles of emotional and behavioral symptoms from early childhood to adolescence, their stability across development and associated factors.
Method: Our sample included 17,216 children assessed at ages 3, 5, 7, 11, and 14 from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. We used latent profile and latent transition analysis to study their emotional and behavioral profiles from early childhood to adolescence. We included sociodemographic, family, and parenting variables to study the effect on the latent profile's membership and transitions.
Results: The number and specific profiles of emotional and behavioral symptoms change with the developmental stage. We found a higher number of profiles for ages 3, 5, and 14, which suggests greater heterogeneity in the presentation of emotional and behavioral symptoms for early childhood and adolescence compared to late childhood. There was greater heterotypic continuity between ages 3 and 5, particularly in transitions from higher to lower severity profiles. Children exposed to socioeconomic disadvantages were more likely to belong or transition to any moderate or high emotional and behavioral symptoms profiles. Maternal psychological distress and harsh parenting were associated with internalizing and externalizing profiles, respectively. Adolescents with high externalizing and internalizing symptoms had the greatest likelihood of reporting substance use, self-harm, and lower mental wellbeing.
Conclusion: Emotional and behavioral symptoms develop early in life, with levels of heterogeneity and heterotypic stability that change throughout development. These results call for interventions for the prevention and treatment of pediatric mental illness that can account for the heterogeneity and stability of symptoms across development.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015917v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015917v2.full.pdf","2020-01-03","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"ULCERATIVE COLITIS-DERIVED COLONOID CULTURE: A Multi-Mineral-Approach to Improve Barrier Protein Expression","Background: Recent studies demonstrated that Aquamin, a calcium-, magnesium-, and multiple trace element-rich natural product, improves barrier structure and function in colonoids obtained from the tissue of healthy subjects.  The goal of the present study was to determine if the colonic barrier could be improved in tissue from subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC).  
Methods: Colonoid cultures were established with tissue from 9 individuals with UC.  The colonoids were then incubated for a 2-week period under control conditions (i.e., in culture medium with a final calcium concentration of 0.25 mM) or in the same medium supplemented with Aquamin to provide 1.5 - 4.5 mM calcium.  Effects on differentiation and barrier protein expression were determined using several approaches: phase-contrast & scanning electron microscopy, quantitative histology & immunohistology, mass spectrometry-based proteome assessment and transmission electron microscopy. 
Results: Aquamin-treated colonoids demonstrated a modest up-regulation of tight junctional proteins but stronger induction of adherens junction proteins and desmosomal proteins.  Increased desmosomes were seen at the ultrastructural level.  Proteomic analysis also demonstrated increased expression of basement membrane proteins and hemidesmosomal components.  Proteins expressed at the apical surface (mucins and trefoils) were also increased as were several additional proteins with anti-microbial activity or that modulate inflammation.  Conclusion: A majority of individuals including patients with UC do not reach the recommended daily intake for calcium and other minerals.  The findings presented here suggest that adequate mineral intake might improve the colonic barrier.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014662v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014662v2.full.pdf","2020-01-03","Gastroenterology

"Pain Reduction by Inducing Sensory-Motor Adaptation in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS PRISMA): Protocol for a Double-blind Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) presents as chronic, continuous pain and sensory, autonomic, and motor abnormalities affecting one or more extremities. People with CRPS can also show changes in their perception of and attention to the affected body part and sensory information in the affected side of space. Prism Adaptation (PA) is a behavioural intervention targeted at reducing attention deficits in post-stroke hemispatial neglect. PA also appears to reduce pain and other CRPS symptoms; however, these therapeutic effects have been demonstrated only in small unblinded studies. This paper describes the protocol for an ongoing double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of PA treatment for CRPS. The secondary aims of the study are to examine the relationships between neuropsychological changes (such as spatial attention, space and body representation, and motor spatial performance) and clinical manifestations of CRPS, as well as symptom improvement. Methods: Forty-two participants with upper-limb CRPS type I will undergo two weeks of twice-daily PA treatment or sham treatment. The primary outcome measures are current pain intensity and CRPS severity score, measured immediately before and after the treatment period. Secondary outcome measures include the results of self-report questionnaires about pain, movement, symptoms interference, and body representation; clinical assessments of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions; and computer-based psychophysical tests of neuropsychological functions. Data are collected in four research visits: four weeks and one day before treatment, and one day and four weeks after the end of treatment. Additional follow-up through postal questionnaires is conducted three and six months post-treatment. Discussion: It is hypothesised that participants undergoing PA treatment, compared to those receiving sham treatment, will show greater reduction in pain and CRPS severity score, and improvements on other clinical and neuropsychological measures. Also, more pronounced neuropsychological symptoms are predicted to correlate with more severe clinical CRPS symptoms. This study will provide the first randomized double-blind evaluation of the therapeutic effects of PA that could be implemented as a rehabilitation method for CRPS, and will contribute to the understanding of how neuropsychological changes in body representation and attention pertain to the manifestation and treatment of CRPS.","/content/10.1101/19000653v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000653v2.full.pdf","2020-01-03","Pain Medicine

"An Efficient and Robust Approach to Detect Auditory Evoked Brainstem Responses using Adaptive Averaging","Objective: Auditory brainstem response (ABR) is widely employed to evaluate auditory function of patients and lab animals. Despite attempts in automation, hearing threshold estimation still relies on professional inspection of audiograms. The aim of this study is to develop an automated procedure to detect the hearing threshold.
Study Sample: ABR tests were performed on eight mice and four human participants.
Design: Adaptive averaging strategy was proposed. It models the number of sweeps for averaging that leads to a detectable ABR at progressively reduced loudness level.
Results: Noise-overwhelmed responses at threshold levels lead to an exponential increase in this number, allowing automated threshold estimation with high precision. Furthermore, up to 70% sweeps were saved by stopping ongoing averaging upon detected responses.
Conclusion: Implementation of this method in commercial devices will automate the ABR test in a more reliable and cost-effective fashion. ","/content/10.1101/19003301v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003301v2.full.pdf","2020-01-03","Otolaryngology

"The role of Body Mass Index in high and low velocity trauma causing knee injury associated to popliteal artery lesions.","Background: Osteoarticular traumas are particularly dangerous among arterial traumas, those associated with the popliteal artery are associated with a high amputation rate. Despite representing a minority of arterial traumas, with an incidence that considerably varies by population and geographic location, traumatic lesions of the popliteal artery are a challenge. This study aimed to verify the impact of BMI on arterial trauma damage and outcome.
Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from the emergency and operating rooms electronic medical reports at  our Institution between 1 January 2005 and 1 May 2018 of all osteoarticular and vascular associated lesion. 41 pts presented with lower limb arterial trauma (43.2%), and popliteal artery lesions occurred in 11 (26.8%). 11 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. In addition, the lesion mechanism was dislocation by high-velocity trauma in 9 cases and by low-velocity trauma in 3. All 7 males (63.6%) were affected by high-velocity trauma, and 2 of the 3 females by low-velocity trauma. Only one patient had an isolated popliteal artery lesion associated with fractures in the leg or in contralateral limb. Patients with low-velocity traumas were older than 54 years while those with high-velocity were aged from 22 to 71 years.
Results: The lesion mechanism was dislocation due to high-velocity trauma in eight patients and due to low-velocity trauma in three. In 10/11 patients (90.9%)  revascularization was performed after osteoarticular stabilization. after reduction of the dislocation or fracture. Intraoperative angiography was selectively used. Two patients required above-knee amputation after the procedure: one due to infection of the surgical access and the other due to severe soft tissue injury.

"Dissecting the mechanisms of a 5-year decline in antibiotic prescribing","Importance: The mechanisms driving the recent decline in outpatient antibiotic prescribing are unknown.

Objective: To estimate the extent to which reductions in the number of antibiotic prescriptions filled per outpatient visit (stewardship) and reductions in the monthly rate of outpatient visits (observed disease) for infectious disease conditions each contributed to the decline in annual outpatient antibiotic prescribing rate in Massachusetts between 2011 and 2015.

Design: Outpatient medical and pharmacy claims from the Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Database were used to estimate rates of antibiotic prescribing and outpatient visits for 20 medical conditions and their contributions to the overall decline in antibiotic prescribing. Trends were compared to those in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS).

Setting: Outpatient visits in Massachusetts between January 2011 and September 2015. Participants: 5,075,908 individuals with commercial health insurance or Medicaid in Massachusetts under the age of 65 and 495,515 patients included in NAMCS.

Main outcomes and measures: The number of antibiotic prescriptions avoided through reductions in observed disease and reductions in per-visit prescribing rate per medical condition.

Results: Between 2011 and 2015, the January antibiotic prescribing rate per 1,000 individuals in Massachusetts declined by 18.9% and the July antibiotic prescribing rate declined by 13.6%. The mean prescribing rate for children under 5 declined by 42.8% (95% CI 21.7%, 59.4%), principally reflecting reduced wintertime prescribing. The monthly rate of outpatient visits per 1,000 individuals in Massachusetts declined (p < 0.05) for respiratory infections and urinary tract infections. Nationally, visits for medical conditions that merit an antibiotic prescription also declined between 2010 and 2015. Of the estimated 358 antibiotic prescriptions per 1,000 individuals avoided over the study period in Massachusetts, 59% (95% CI 54%, 63%) were attributable to reductions in observed disease and 41% (95% CI 37%, 46%) to reductions in prescribing per outpatient visit.

Conclusions and relevance: The decline in antibiotic prescribing in Massachusetts was driven by a decline in observed disease and improved antibiotic stewardship, with a contemporaneous reduction in visits for conditions prompting antibiotics observed nationally. A focus on infectious disease prevention should be considered alongside antibiotic stewardship as a means to reduce antibiotic prescribing.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.02.20016329v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.02.20016329v1.full.pdf","2020-01-03","Epidemiology

"Exploiting the Reverse Vaccinology Approach to Design Novel Subunit Vaccine against Ebola Virus","Ebola virus is a highly pathogenic RNA virus that causes haemorrhagic fever in human. With very high mortality rate, Ebola virus is considered as one of the dangerous viruses in the world. Although, the Ebola outbreaks claimed many lives in the past, no satisfactory treatment or vaccine have been discovered yet to fight against Ebola. For this reason, in this study, various tools of bioinformatics and immunoinformatics were used to design possible vaccines against Zaire Ebola virus strain Mayinga-76. To construct the vaccine, three potential antigenic proteins of the virus, matrix protein VP40, envelope glycoprotein and nucleoprotein were selected against which the vaccines would be designed. The MHC class-I, MHC class-II and B-cell epitopes were determined and after robust analysis through various tools and molecular docking analysis, three vaccine candidates, designated as EV-1, EV-2 and EV-3, were constructed. Since the highly conserved epitopes were used for vaccine construction, these vaccine constructs are also expected to be effective on other strains of Ebola virus like strain Gabon-94 and Kikwit-95. Next, the molecular docking study on these vaccine constructs were analyzed by molecular docking study and EV-1 emerged as the best vaccine construct. Later, molecular dynamics simulation study revealed the good performances as well as good stability of the vaccine protein. Finally, codon adaptation and in silico cloning were conducted to design a possible plasmid (pET-19b plasmid vector was used) for large scale, industrial production of the EV-1 vaccine.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.02.20016311v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.02.20016311v1.full.pdf","2020-01-03","Allergy and Immunology

"Surgical candidacy and treatment uptake among women with cervical cancer at public referral hospitals in Kampala, Uganda","Purpose: Cervical cancer is the most common malignancy among women in Uganda. Most present with advanced disease, when hysterectomy is not possible and cure is less likely. This study reports the proportion recommended for hysterectomy and associated factors, recommended treatments by stage, and treatment uptake. 
Methods: We conducted a prospective study among patients seeking care for cervical cancer at public referral hospitals in Uganda. In-person surveys were followed by a phone call. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses examined associations between predictors and outcomes.
Results: Among 268 participants, 76% were diagnosed at an advanced stage (IIB-IVB). In total, 12% were recommended for hysterectomy. In adjusted analysis, living within 15 kilometers of Kampala (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.20-8.03) and prior screening (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.22-6.83) were significantly associated with surgical candidacy. Radiotherapy availability was not significantly associated with treatment recommendations for early-stage (IA-IIA) disease, but was associated with recommended treatment modality (chemo-radiation versus primary chemotherapy) for locally advanced stage (IIB-IIIB). Most (67%) had started treatment. No demographic or health factor, treatment recommendation, or radiation availability was associated with treatment initiation. Among those recommended for hysterectomy, 55% underwent surgery. Among those who had initiated treatment, 82% started the modality that was actually recommended. 
Conclusion: Women presented to public referral centers in Kampala with mostly advanced-stage cervical cancer and few were recommended for surgery. Lack of access to radiation did not significantly increase the proportion of early-stage cancers recommended for hysterectomy.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016279v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016279v1.full.pdf","2020-01-03","Oncology

"Sensitive detection of tumor mutations from blood and its application to immunotherapy prognosis","Liquid biopsy using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is attractive for a wide range of clinical applications, including cancer detection, locating, and monitoring. However, developing these applications requires precise and sensitive calling of somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) from cfDNA sequencing data. To date, no SNV caller addresses all the special challenges of cfDNA to provide reliable results. Here we present cfSNV, a revolutionary somatic SNV caller with five innovative techniques to overcome and exploit the unique properties of cfDNA. cfSNV provides hierarchical mutation profiling, thanks to complete coverage of the clonal landscape by cfSNV, and multi-layer error suppression. In both simulated datasets and real patient data, we demonstrate that cfSNV is superior to existing tools, especially for low-frequency somatic SNVs. We also show how the five novel techniques contribute to its performance. Further, we demonstrate a clinical application using cfSNV to select non-small-cell lung cancer patients for immunotherapy treatment.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016253v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016253v1.full.pdf","2020-01-03","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Prevalence, Characteristics, and Associated Factors of Workplace Violence Against Healthcare Professionals in India: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Background: Workplace violence (WPV) against doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals is a growing public health concern affecting health systems in low- and middle-income countries. In India, incidents of WPV against health workforce have become common in recent years. However, there is no synthesized evidence on the nationwide burden of WPV in healthcare. This study aims to systematically evaluate the current evidence on the prevalence, characteristics, and associated factors of WPV against healthcare professionals in India.

Methods: We systematically searched seven major databases and additional sources to retrieved published literature on WPV in India. We included empirical studies without any time restriction, which reported the prevalence of WPV against healthcare professionals in India. Following data extraction, we estimated the pooled prevalence of WPV using random-effects model in meta-analysis. The characteristics and associated factors of WPV were narratively synthesized from these empirical studies.

Results: Among 1065 articles retrieved from multiple sources, 15 studies met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of WPV among 2849 participants in those 15 studies was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54%-72%). In the subgroup analyses, the pooled prevalence for male and female was 64% (95% CI, 51%-78%) and 54% (95% CI, 47%-62%) respectively. Moreover, pooled prevalence in 12-months and lifetime was 55% (95% CI, 43%-67%) and 69% (95% CI, 61%-78%) respectively. Among the participants, the prevalence of verbal violence (52%; 95% CI, 45%-60%) was higher than physical violence (8%; 95% CI, 5%-11%). The emergency department was a common location of WPV, whereas the patients' attendants were perpetrators in most studies. Major factors associated with WPV included ineffective patient-provider communication, less experience of the healthcare professionals, overcrowding, shortage of resources, long waiting hours, lack of security measures, dissatisfaction about health services, high cost of care, the negative role of media, and other socio-behavioral problems among the patients and healthcare professionals. 

Conclusion: WPV is highly prevalent among healthcare professionals in India. Critical challenges within the healthcare and social context necessitate further research, better policymaking, and multipronged interventions to address the same and prevent WPV against healthcare professionals in India.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.01.20016295v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.01.20016295v1.full.pdf","2020-01-03","Public and Global Health

"Novel FARS2 mutations in patients with non-fatal early onset encephalopathy with or without epilepsy","Mitochondrial translation is essential for the biogenesis of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) that synthesizes the bulk of ATP for the cell. Mutations in either mitochondrial DNA or in nuclear genes that encode mitochondrial translation factors can result in impaired OXPHOS biogenesis and mitochondrial diseases with variable clinical presentations.
Mutations in the FARS2 gene encoding the mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase are commonly linked to either early-onset epileptic mitochondrial encephalopathy or spastic paraplegia. Here, we expand the genetic spectrum of FARS2-linked disease with three patients carrying novel compound heterozygous variants in the FARS2 gene and presenting with spastic tetraparesis, axial hypotonia and myoclonic epilepsy in two cases.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.19016139v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.19016139v1.full.pdf","2020-01-03","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Polygenic Risk for Depression is Associated with the Severity and Rate of Change in Depressive Symptoms Across Adolescence","Background: Adolescence marks a period where depression will commonly onset and previous research using twin studies has suggested that genetic influences play a role in how depression develops and changes across adolescence. Recent genome-wide association studies have also shown that common genetic variants  which can be brought together as polygenic risk scores (PRS)  are also implicated in depression. However, the role of PRS in adolescent depression and changes in adolescent depression is not yet understood. The aim of this study was to examine the association between a PRS for depressive symptoms and depressive symptoms across adolescence and young adulthood, and how polygenic risk is associated with changes in depressive symptoms using two methods: cross-sectional analysis and multilevel growth curve modelling to examine the rate of change over time. 
Methods: Using data from over 6000 participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) we examined associations between genetic liability to depressive symptoms (polygenic risk score (PRS) for depressive symptoms) and self-reported depressive symptoms (short mood and feelings questionnaire over 9 occasions from 10-24 years). We examined cross-sectional associations at each age and trajectories of depressive symptoms in a repeated measures framework using growth curve analysis. 
Results: The PRS was associated with depressive symptoms throughout adolescence and young adulthood in both cross-sectional and growth curve analyses, though associations were stronger in the latter analyses. Growth curve analyses also provided additional insights, demonstrating that individuals with a higher PRS had steeper trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence with a greater increasing rate of change.
Conclusions: In a longitudinal study spanning adolescence to early adult life, these results show that common genetics variants as indexed by a PRS for depressive symptoms influence both the severity of rate of change in adolescent depressive symptoms. Longitudinal data that make use of repeated measures designs have the potential to provide insights into the factors that influence the onset and persistence of adolescent depression.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016212v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016212v1.full.pdf","2020-01-03","Epidemiology

"A Systematic Review on Psychological and Biological Mediators Between Adversity and Psychosis: Potential Targets for Treatment","Various psychological and biological pathways have been proposed as mediators between childhood adverse events (CA) and psychosis. A systematic review of the evidence in this domain is needed. The aim of this work is to systematically review the evidence on psychological and biological mediators between CA and psychosis across the psychosis spectrum. This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (registration number: CRD42018100846). Articles published between 1979 and July 2019 were identified through a literature search in OVID (PsychINFO; Medline and Embase). The evidence by each analysis and each study results are presented by group of mediator categories found in the review. The percentage of total effect mediated was calculated. 47 studies were included, with a total of 79,668  from general population (GP) and 3,189 from clinical samples. The quality of studies was judged as 'fair'. Our results showed (i) solid evidence of mediation between CA and psychosis by negative cognitive schemas about the self, the world, and others (NS); by dissociation and other PTSD symptoms; (ii) evidence of al mediation through an affective pathway (affective dysregulation, anxiety, and depression) in GP; (iii)  lack of studies exploring biological mediators. To conclude, we found evidence suggesting that various overlapping and not competing pathways contribute partially to the link between adversity and psychosis. Experiences of adversity, along with relevant mediators such as PTSD and mood related symptoms and NS, should be routinely assessed in patients with psychosis. Targeting such mediators through cognitive behavioural aproaches using trauma-focused therapy and/or pharmacological means could be a useful addition to the traditional treatment of positive symptoms.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014506v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014506v3.full.pdf","2020-01-06","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Malignant pleural effusions as an alternative to biopsies for the detection of EGFR TKI sensitizing mutations","Lung cancer is the cause of a fourth of all cancer-related deaths. About a third of all lung adenocarcinoma tumours harbour mutations on exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Detection of these mutations must be both accurate and timely as patients with certain EGFR mutations have better clinical outcomes when treated with EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In our study, we utilized malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) as liquid biopsies to detect EGFR mutations when tissue biopsies were unavailable. First,  a direct sequencing approach was attempted leading to the detection of a common exon 19 deletion. We then tested the sensitivity of this method by sequencing the mutant DNA sample diluted with wildtype DNA. Signatures of this large deletion were detectable even in a 1 part mutant and 99 part wildtype mixture but with poor base-call confidence. MPEs consist of both wildtype inflammatory cells as well as mutant metastatic cells suggesting that this sequencing-based approach was going to limit our ability to detect single base-pair mutations. To mitigate this limitation of sequencing, an EGFR mutant-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay was used on a further n=10 pleural effusion samples (1 non-malignant pleural effusion as an internal negative control). 5/9 (55.55%) samples harboured EGFR mutations with 2/9 (22.22%) being exon 19 deletions and 3/9 (33.33%) had the S768I exon 20 mutation. These data suggest MPEs may be utilized to detect mutations even before a biopsy is made available. The high frequency of S768I mutations seen in our study suggests that cancer cells harbouring these mutations may be superior in their ability to migrate, home or reside in pleural fluid.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.08.19014167v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.08.19014167v2.full.pdf","2020-01-06","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Comparison of first trimester dating methods for gestational age estimation and their implication on preterm birth classification in a North Indian cohort","Background 
Different methods and formulae have been developed for different populations for estimation of GA in the first trimester of pregnancy. In this study, we develop an Indian population-specific GA dating formula and compare its performance with the previously published formulae. Finally, we evaluate the implications of the choice of dating method on preterm birth (PTB) rate. The data for this study was from the GARBH-Ini cohort, an ongoing (2015-2019) longitudinal pregnancy cohort of North Indian women to study PTB. 
Methods
Comparisons between USG (Hadlock) and LMP-based dating methods were made by studying the distribution of their differences by BA analysis. Population-specific dating formula for the first trimester of pregnancy (Garbhini-1 formula) was developed by constructing a regression model for GA as a non-linear function of CRL, which was then compared with published formulae by BA analysis. The PTB rate was estimated by using each of these methods and expressed as prevalence and 95% CI.
Results
LMP-based method overestimates GA by three days as compared to USG (Hadlock) method with limits of agreement between -4.39 and 3.51 weeks (95% CI). CRL is the most critical parameter in estimating GA in the first trimester. No other clinical or socioeconomic parameter enumerated in the GARBH-Ini cohort study contributes to GA estimation. The GA estimated by all the formulae compared showed an agreement within a week with the uppermost and the lowermost limits of agreement (LOA) being -0.46,0.96 weeks. The estimated PTB rate across all the formulae ranged between 12.12 and 16.85% with Garbhini-1 formula estimating the least rate.
Conclusions 
Our study reinforces the fact that CRL-based USG method is best for estimation of GA in the first trimester and addition of clinical and demographic features does not improve its accuracy. Garbhini-1 formula developed from our population data performs at par with the existing formulae but estimates the lowest PTB rate with better precision than other formulae. The applicability of Garbhini-1 formulae for the rest of the Indian population needs to be validated in subsequent studies.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.27.19016006v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.27.19016006v1.full.pdf","2020-01-06","Obstetrics and Gynecology

"Childhood vaccination coverage and equity impact in Ethiopia by socioeconomic, geographic, maternal and child characteristics","Background: Ethiopia is a priority country of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to improve vaccination coverage and equitable uptake. The Ethiopian National Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) and the Global Vaccine Action Plan set coverage goals of 90% at national level and 80% at district level by 2020. This study aims to analyse basic vaccination coverage among children in Ethiopia and to estimate the equity impact by socioeconomic, geographic, maternal and child characteristics based on data from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2016.
Methods: Basic vaccination coverage (1-dose BCG, 3-doses DPT-HepB-Hib, 3-doses polio, 1-dose measles vaccine) of 2,004 children aged 12-23 months was analysed. Mean coverage was disaggregated by socioeconomic (household wealth, religion, ethnicity), geographic (area of residence, region), maternal (maternal age at birth, maternal education, maternal marital status, sex of household head) and child (sex of child, birth order) characteristics. Concentration indices assessed wealth and education-related inequalities. Multiple logistic regression estimated associations between basic vaccination coverage and socioeconomic, maternal and child characteristics.
Results: National coverage for basic vaccinations was 39.7% in 2016. Single vaccination coverage ranged between between 53.2% (DTP3) and 69.2% (BCG). Wealth and maternal education related inequities were present for all vaccines. Children from richer households, urban regions, primary maternal education and male headed households were associated with higher vaccination coverage. The Ethiopia Mini Demographic and Health Survey 2019 reports national coverage for basic vaccinations at 43.3% with single vaccination coverage ranging between 57.8% (measles) and 74.2% (BCG).
Conclusions: Vaccination coverage has improved from 2016 to 2019, but remains below the coverage goals of the EPI. Low vaccination coverage is associated with poorer households, rural regions of Afar and Somali, no maternal education and female headed households. Targeted approaches are necessary to improve vaccination coverage among these population subgroups and equitable uptake of vaccines in Ethiopia.

"Prevalence of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Mexican Older Adults: Data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS)","INTRODUCTION: We estimated the prevalence and risk factors for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its subtypes in Mexican population using the cognitive aging ancillary study of the Mexican Health and Aging Study. 
METHODS: Using a robust norms approach and comprehensive neuropsychological criteria, we determined MCI in a sample of adult Mexicans (N=1,807;55-97years). Additionally, we determined prevalence rates using traditional criteria.
RESULTS: Prevalence of amnestic MCI was 5.9%. Other MCI subtypes ranged 4.3% to 7.7%. MCI with and without memory impairment was associated with older age and rurality. Depression, diabetes and low educational attainment were associated with MCI without memory impairment. Using traditional criteria, prevalence of MCI was lower (2.2% amnestic MCI, other subtypes ranged 1.3%-2.4%). 
DISCUSSION: Older age, depression, low education, diabetes, and rurality were associated with increased risk of MCI among older adults in Mexico. Our findings suggest that the causes of cognitive impairment are likely multifactorial and may vary by MCI subtype.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016345v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016345v1.full.pdf","2020-01-06","Neurology

"Performance of FRAX in predicting fracture in the US postmenopausal women with varied race and genetic profiles",": Background: Whether the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) performed differently in estimating the 10-year fracture probability in women of different genetic profiling and race remained unclear. Methods: The genomic data in the Women's Health Initiative study was analyzed (n=23,981). the genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated from 14 fracture-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each participant. FRAX without bone mineral density (BMD) was used to estimate fracture probability. Results: FRAX significantly overestimated the risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) in the WHI study. The most enormous overestimation was observed in women with low GRS (predicted/observed ratio [POR]: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.45-1.79), in Asian women (POR: 3.5, 95% CI 2.48-4.81), and in African American women (POR: 2.59, 95% CI: 2.33-2.87). Compared to the low GRS group, the 10-year probability of MOF adjusted for the FRAX score was 21% and 30% higher in median GRS group and high GRS group, respectively. Asian, African American, and Hispanic women respectively had a 78%, 76%, and 56% lower hazard than Caucasian women after the FRAX score was adjusted for. The results were similar when for hip fractures. Conclusions: Our study suggested the FRAX performance varies significantly by both genetic profiling and race in postmenopausal women.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016444v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016444v1.full.pdf","2020-01-06","Epidemiology

"Serum metabolite profiles are associated with the presence of advanced liver fibrosis in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B viral infection","Background & Aims: Accurate and noninvasive diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis is essential for effective clinical management of chronic liver disease (CLD). We aimed to identify serum metabolite markers that reliably predict the stage of fibrosis in CLD patients. Methods: We quantitatively profiled serum metabolites of participants in 2 independent cohorts. Based on the metabolomics data from Cohort 1 (504 HBV associated liver fibrosis patients and 502 normal controls, NC), we selected a panel of 4 predictive metabolite markers. Consequently, we constructed 3 machine learning models with the 4 metabolite markers using random forest (RF), to differentiate CLD patients from normal controls (NC), to differentiate cirrhosis patients from fibrosis patients, and to differentiate advanced fibrosis from early fibrosis, respectively. 
Results: The panel of 4 metabolite markers consisted of taurocholate, tyrosine, valine, and linoelaidic acid. The RF models of the metabolite panel demonstrated the strongest stratification ability in Cohort 1 to diagnose CLD patients from NC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.997 and the precision-recall curve (AUPR) = 0.994), to differentiate fibrosis from cirrhosis (0.941, 0.870), and to stage liver fibrosis (0.918, 0.892). The diagnostic accuracy of the models was further validated in an independent Cohort 2 consisting of 300 CLD patients with chronic HBV infection and 90 NC. The AUCs of the models were consistently higher than APRI, FIB-4 and AST/ALT ratio, with both greater sensitivity and specificity. 
Conclusion: Our study showed that this 4-metabolite panel has potential usefulness in clinical assessments of CLD progression.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.02.20016352v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.02.20016352v1.full.pdf","2020-01-06","Gastroenterology

"The genetic architecture of left ventricular non-compaction reveals both substantial overlap with other cardiomyopathies and a distinct aetiology in a subset of cases","Rationale: Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a condition characterised by trabeculations in the myocardial wall and is the subject of considerable conjecture as to whether it represents a distinct pathology or a secondary phenotype associated with other cardiac diseases, particularly cardiomyopathies.
Objective: To investigate the genetic architecture of LVNC by identifying genes and variant classes robustly associated with disease and comparing these to other genetically characterised cardiomyopathies.
Methods and Results: We performed rare variant association analysis using six different LVNC cohorts comprising 840 cases together with 125,748 gnomAD population controls and compared results to similar analyses with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cases. We observed substantial overlap in genes and variant classes enriched in LVNC and DCM/HCM, indicating that in many cases LVNC belongs to a spectrum of more established cardiomyopathies, with non-compaction representing a phenotypic variation in patients with DCM- or HCM-causing variants. In contrast, five variant classes were uniquely enriched in LVNC cases, of which truncating variants in MYH7, ACTN2 and PRDM16 may represent a distinct LVNC aetiology. MYH7 truncating variants are generally considered as non-pathogenic but were detected in 2% of LVNC cases compared to 0.1% of controls, including a cluster of variants around a single splice region. Additionally, structural variants (exon deletions) in RYR2 and missense variants in the transmembrane region of HCN4 were enriched in LVNC cases, confirming prior reports regarding the association of these variant classes with combined LVNC and arrhythmia phenotypes.
Conclusions: We demonstrated that genetic association analysis can clarify the relationship between LVNC and established cardiomyopathies, highlighted substantial overlap with DCM/HCM but also identified variant classes associated with distinct LVNC and with joint LVNC/arrhythmia phenotypes. These results underline the complex genetic landscape of LVNC and inform how genetic testing in LVNC cases should be pursued and interpreted.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.19015602v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.19015602v1.full.pdf","2020-01-06","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"A novel art of continuous non-invasive blood pressure measurement","Wearable sensors to continuously measure blood pressure (BP) and derived cardiovascular variables have the potential to revolutionize patient monitoring. Current wearable methods analyzing time components (e.g., pulse transit time) still lack clinical accuracy, whereas existing technologies for direct BP measurement are too bulky. Here we present a new art of continuous non-invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring (CNAP2GO). It directly measures BP by using a new ""volume control technique"" and could be used for small wearable sensors integrated in a finger ring. As a software prototype, CNAP2GO showed excellent BP measurement performance in comparison with invasive BP in 46 patients having surgery. The resulting pulsatile BP signal carries information to derive cardiac output and other hemodynamic variables. We show that CNAP2GO can be miniaturized for wearable approaches. CNAP2GO potentially constitutes the breakthrough for wearable sensors for blood pressure and flow monitoring in both ambulatory and in-hospital clinical settings.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19013938v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19013938v2.full.pdf","2020-01-07","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Identification of de novo mutations in prenatal neurodevelopment-associated genes in schizophrenia in two Han Chinese patient-sibling family-based cohorts","Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. High heritability of SCZ suggests a major role for transmitted genetic variants. Furthermore, SCZ is also associated with a marked reduction in fecundity, leading to the hypothesis that alleles with large effects on risk might often occur de novo. In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing for 23 families from two cohorts with matched unaffected siblings and parents. Two nonsense de novo mutations (DNMs) in GJC1 and HIST1H2AD were identified in SCZ patients. Ten genes (DPYSL2, NBPF1, SDK1, ZNF595, ZNF718, GCNT2, SNX9, AACS, KCNQ1 and MSI2) were found to carry more DNMs in SCZ patients than their unaffected siblings by burden test. Expression analyses indicated that these DNM implicated genes showed significantly higher expression in prefrontal cortex in prenatal stage. The DNM in the GJC1 gene is highly likely a loss function mutation (pLI = 0.94), leading to the dysregulation of ion channel in the glutamatergic excitatory neurons. Analysis of rare variants in independent exome sequencing dataset indicates that GJC1 has significantly more rare variants in SCZ patients than in unaffected controls. Data from genome-wide association studies suggested that common variants in the GJC1 gene may be associated with SCZ and SCZ-related traits. Genes co-expressed with GJC1 are involved in SCZ, SCZ-associated pathways and drug targets. These evidence suggest that GJC1 may be a risk gene for SCZ and its function may be involved in prenatal and early neurodevelopment, a vulnerable period for developmental disorders such as SCZ.","/content/10.1101/19011007v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011007v3.full.pdf","2020-01-07","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"High occurrence of transportation and logistics occupations among vascular dementia patients: an observational study","Background
Growing evidence suggests a role of occupation in the emergence and manifestation of dementia. Occupations are often defined by complexity level, although working environments and activities differ in several other important ways. We aimed to capture the multi-faceted nature of occupation through its measurement as a qualitative (instead of a quantitative) variable and explored its relationship with different types of dementia.

Methods
We collected occupational information of 2121 dementia patients with various suspected etiologies from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (age M=67, SD=8; 57% male; MMSE M=21, SD=5). Our final sample included individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia (n=1467), frontotemporal dementia (n=281), vascular dementia (n=98), Lewy body disease (n=174), and progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration (n=101). Within the AD group, we used neuropsychological data to further characterize patients by clinical phenotypes. All participants were categorized into 1 of 11 occupational classes, across which we evaluated the distribution of dementia (sub)types with Chi2 analyses. We gained further insight into occupation-dementia relationships through post hoc logistic regressions that included various demographic and health characteristics as explanatory variables.

Results
There were significant differences in the distribution of dementia types across occupation groups (Chi2=85.87, p<.001). Vascular dementia was relatively common in the Transportation/Logistics sector, and higher vascular risk factors partly explained this relationship. AD occurred less in Transportation/Logistics and more in Health Care/Welfare occupations, which related to a higher/lower percentage of males. We found no relationships between occupational classes and clinical phenotypes of AD (Chi2=53.65, n.s.).

Conclusions
Relationships between occupation and dementia seem to exist beyond the complexity level, which offers new opportunities for disease prevention and improvement of occupational health policy.","/content/10.1101/19005512v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005512v2.full.pdf","2020-01-08","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Automated interpretation of the coronary angioscopy with deep convolutional neural networks","Background: Coronary angioscopy (CAS) is a useful modality to assess atherosclerotic changes, but interpretation of the images requires expert knowledge. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) can be used for diagnostic prediction and image synthesis.
Methods: 107 images from 47 patients, who underwent coronary angioscopy in our hospital between 2014 and 2017, and 864 images, selected from 142 MEDLINE-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2019, were analyzed. First, we developed a prediction model for the angioscopic findings. Next, we made a generative adversarial networks (GAN) model to simulate the CAS images. Finally, we tried to control the output images according to the angioscopic findings with conditional GAN architecture.
Results: For both yellow color (YC) grade and neointimal coverage (NC) grade, we could observe strong correlations between the true grades and the predicted values (YC grade, average r value = 0.80  0.02, p-value <0.001; NC grade, average r value = 0.73  0.02, p < 0.001). The binary classification model for the red thrombus yielded 0.71  0.03 F1- score and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.91  0.02. The standard GAN model could generate realistic CAS images (average Inception score = 3.57  0.06). GAN-based data augmentation improved the performance of the prediction models. In the conditional GAN model, there were significant correlations between given values and expert's diagnosis in YC grade but not in NC grade.
Conclusion: DCNN is useful in both predictive and generative modeling that can help develop the diagnostic support system for CAS.","/content/10.1101/19001693v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001693v3.full.pdf","2020-01-08","Cardiovascular Medicine

"At what geographic scales does agricultural alienation amplify foodborne disease outbreaks? A statistical test for 25 U.S. states, 1970-2000","The modern economy is driving multiple environmental and social crises across the globe. Capital accumulation externalizes the myriad damage associated with commodity production to ecosystems, labor, public health, and governments across jurisdictions. A growing literature shows multinational agriculture, a major sector of the economy, plays a fundamental role in disrupting the ecological cycles upon which communities across the globe depend. We report here one of the first statistical tests of such an ecosocial rift. We used geometric morphometrics to characterize a parameter space in agricultural alienation across nature, human welfare, and industrial appropriation for 25 U.S. states, at five-year increments between 1970 and 2000. The first two relative warps of the analysis reproduce the long-documented shift in and out of the 1980s farming crisis. We found the crisis left the U.S. food system in a new configuration, with commodity crops replacing cropland pasture, greater farm debt load, overcapitalized inputs, and a relative decline in on-farm wages. To determine if such a shift had an epidemiological impact, we tested whether salmonellosis and shigellosis - two foodborne pathogens for which national incidence data across the study period were available - regressed against historical changes in this alienation space across geographic scale. The second relative warp for shigellosis showed a multivariate relationship with the alienation space, but significance failed to withstand a Bonferroni correction. The partial warps and Procrustes residuals of temporal trends in the alienation space likewise exhibited limited predictive capacity for outbreak size. In part these results may reflect sampling artifacts. Data availability limits both the number of years sampled and the variety of diseases tested. Nevertheless, our analyses demonstrate that metabolic rifts associated with specific modes of production can be rigorously investigated.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014910v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014910v2.full.pdf","2020-01-08","Epidemiology

"Eating behavior trajectories in the first ten years of life and their relationship with BMI","Background: Child eating behaviors (EBs) are highly heterogeneous and their longitudinal impact on childhood weight is unclear. The objective of this study was to characterize EBs during the first ten years of life and evaluate associations with BMI at age 11 years.
Method: Data were parental reports of EBs from birth to age 10 years and standardized body mass index (zBMI) at age 11 years (n=12,048) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Latent class growth analysis was used to derive latent classes of over-, under-, and fussy eating. Linear regression models for zBMI at 11 years on each set of classes were fitted to assess associations with EBs trajectories. 
Results: We identified four classes of overeating; low stable (70%), low transient (15%), late increasing (11%), and early increasing (6%). The early increasing class was associated with higher zBMI (boys: =0.83, 95%CI:0.65, 1.02; girls: =1.1; 0.92, 1.28) compared to low stable. Six classes were found for undereating; low stable (25%), low transient (37%), low decreasing (21%), high transient (11%), high decreasing (4%), and high stable (2%). The latter was associated with lower zBMI (boys: =-0.79; -1.15, -0.42; girls: =-0.76; -1.06, -0.45). Six classes were found for fussy eating; low stable (23%), low transient (15%), low increasing (28%), high decreasing (14%), low increasing (13%), high stable (8%). The high stable class was associated with lower zBMI (boys:  =-0.49; -0.68 -0.30; girls:  =-0.35; -0.52, -0.18). 
Conclusions: Early increasing overeating during childhood is associated with higher zBMI at age 11. High persistent levels of undereating and fussy eating are associated with lower zBMI. Longitudinal trajectories of EBs may help identify children potentially at risk of adverse weight outcomes.","/content/10.1101/19003665v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003665v2.full.pdf","2020-01-09","Pediatrics

"Calibration of individual-based models to epidemiological data: a systematic review","Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread.
 
We identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter-search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation.

The PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy - either an optimisation algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles. 
 
Reporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.","/content/10.1101/19006056v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006056v2.full.pdf","2020-01-09","Epidemiology

"Insights into smouldering MS brain pathology with multimodal diffusion tensor and PET imaging","Objective: To evaluate in vivo the co-occurrence of microglial activation and microstructural white matter damage in multiple sclerosis (MS) brain, and to examine their association with clinical disability.
Methods: 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) brain PET imaging was performed for evaluation of microglial activation by using the radioligand [11C](R)-PK11195. TSPO-binding was evaluated as the distribution volume ratio (DVR) from dynamic PET images. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and conventional MRI were performed at the same time. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivities were calculated within the whole normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and segmented NAWM regions appearing normal in conventional MRI. 55 MS patients and 15 healthy controls were examined.
Results: Microstructural damage was observed in the NAWM of MS brain. DTI parameters of MS patients were significantly altered in the NAWM, when compared to an age- and sex-matched healthy control group: mean FA was decreased, and MD, AD and RD were increased. These structural abnormalities correlated with increased TSPO binding in the whole NAWM and in the temporal NAWM (p<0.05 for all correlations; p<0.01 for RD in the temporal NAWM). Both compromised WM integrity and increased microglial activation in the NAWM correlated significantly with higher clinical disability measured with expanded disability status scale (EDSS).
Conclusions: Widespread structural disruption in the NAWM is linked to neuroinflammation, and both phenomena associate with clinical disability. Multimodal PET and DTI imaging allows in vivo evaluation of widespread MS pathology not visible using conventional MRI.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017012v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017012v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Neurology

There are few refined descriptions of VL distribution in CHB, and limited understanding of the biology that underpins these patterns. We set out to describe the VL distribution in independent cohorts from the UK and South Africa, to identify associated host characteristics, and to compare with VL in HIV-1 and hepatitis C (HCV) infection. We show the presence of a 'set-point' in chronic HBV infection and report significant differences in the viral load distribution of HBV when compared to HIV and HCV including a bimodal distribution of viral loads and a much lower median HBV viral load.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.20016972v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.20016972v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Molecular Profiling of Breast Cancer Susceptibility of Obese or Insulin-Resistant and Pre-Diabetic Patients Using ITLN1 and CD295 SNPs","Mutations in cluster of differentiation (CD) 295 gene, encoding class I cytokine receptor, are associated with obesity and breast cancer (BC). SNPs in the adipocyte-inferred novel cytokine intelectin 1 (ITLN1) remain understudied in connection to CD295 polymorphisms and diabetes mellitus (DM) or a pre-diabetic state, as well as to DNA damage seen in BC. We will explore whether CD295 (ID rs6700896) and ITLN1 (rs rs952804) SNPs impact BC with or without DM, insulin resistance (IR) or obesity. Effects of ITLN1 or CD295 polymorphism(s) on DNA damage in BC were also examined. Blood samples from 170 women with BC (including 33 and 48 with DM and pre-diabetes, respectively) and from 108 age-matched women in the control group were collected. Plasma insulin, leptin, CD295, and ITLN1 levels were measured by ELISA. DNA damage was assessed using an alkaline comet assay. BC cases with clinical stage T II and positive LN as well as tumor histologic grade III, presence of obesity, pre-diabetic events, DM or IR were associated with CD295 rs6700986 mutant homozygous (CC) and heterozygous (CT) genotype and ITLN1 rs952804 mutant heterozygous genotype (CT) (P = 0.05). Tail DNA (%) and tail moment units were significantly associated with CD295 rs6700986 CT and ITLN1 rs952804 TT genotypes. C allele (CT+CC vs. TT) and T allele (TT+CT vs. CC) for CD295 rs6700986 and ITLN1 rs952804, respectively, were associated with BC risk (P = 0.05). ITLN1 (rs952804) and CD295 (rs6700986) SNPs should be considered as BC associated-susceptibility risk factors in obese, insulin resistant, or pre-diabetics.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.20016980v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.20016980v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Oncology

"Efficacy and Safety of PD-1/PD-L1 plus CTLA-4 antibodies +/- Other Therapies in Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have brought hope for patients with advanced lung cancer, among which PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors have achieved considerable results. This meta-analysis aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 combined with CTLA-4 antibodies in patients with advanced lung cancer.
Materials and Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) study of PD-1/PD-L1 combined with CTLA-4 inhibitors for advanced lung cancer was searched in the database for systematic review and meta-analysis.
Results: The meta-analysis finally included 4 trials (actually 3 trials), and the results showed that the overall response rate of PD-1/PD-L1 combined with CTLA-4 inhibitor was higher than that of the control group (ORR = 2.29 [95% CI 1.58 3.32], P <0.0001). PFS significantly improved compared with conventional treatment (HR = 0.69 [95% CI 0.56, 0.85], P = 0.0005), which was statistically significant. OS also improved but did not statistically significant (HR = 0.80 [95% CI 0.61, 1.05], P = 0.11). PD-1/PD-L1 combined with CTLA-4 inhibitors had a higher incidence of adverse reactions than conventional treatment (OR = 1.72 [95% CI 0.59, 5.09], P = 0.33), but the incidence of grade=3 AEs was lower than the control group (OR = 0.96 [95% CI 0.64, 1.44], P = 0.85).
Conclusion: Double checkpoint inhibitor PD-1/PD-L1 combined with CTLA-4 antibody has synergistic anti-cancer activity and improved ORR and PFS in lung cancer. Adverse reactions are more common than conventional treatment, but are generally controllable. Therefore, PD-1/PD-L1 combined with CTLA-4 inhibitors provides a beacon for the treatment of advanced lung cancer, which has guiding significance for the treatment selection in the future.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.20016915v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.20016915v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Oncology

"Identification of Blood-based Non-invasive Biomarkers and Therapeutic Agents against Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC): A Network-based Study","Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most demolishing form of pancreatic cancer with poor prognosis and rising incidence. Difficulties in the early detection and aggressive biological nature of this disease are responsible for most of the therapeutic failures. In this study publicly available microarray expression data of full RNA from peripheral blood of PDAC patient has been utilized via network-based approach in order to identify potential non-invasive biomarkers and drug targets for early diagnosis and treatment of PDAC. Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed their predominant involvement in translational process, apoptotic process, protein phosphorylation, immune responses, ATP binding, protein binding and signal transduction. Moreover, CREBBP, MAPK14, MAPK1, SMAD3, UBC, MAGOH, HSP90AB1, RPL23A, ACTB and STAT3 were identified as the best proteome signatures, GATA2, FOXC1, PPARG, E2F1, HINFP, USF2, MEF2A, FOXL1, YY1 and NFIC were identified as the best transcriptional regulatory signatures, and hsa-miR-93, hsa-miR-16, hsa-miR-195, hsa-miR-424, hsa-miR-506, hsa-miR-124, hsa-miR-590-3p, hsa-miR-1, hsa-miR-497 and hsa-miR-9 were identified as the best post-transcriptional regulatory signatures in PDAC patient.

"Population-based stroke surveillance using Big Data: epidemiological trends in admissions and mortality in Australia.","Background: Epidemiological trends for major causes of death and disability, such as stroke, may be monitored using administrative data to guide public health initiatives and service delivery. 
Methods: We calculated admissions rates for ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage or subarachnoid haemorrhage between January 1, 2005 and December 31st, 2013 and rates of 30-day mortality and 365-day mortality in 30-day survivors to December 31st 2014 for patients aged 15 years or older from New South Wales, Australia (population 7.99 million). Annual Average Percentage Change in rates was estimated using negative binomial regression.
Results: Of 81,703 eligible admissions, 64,047 (78.4%) were ischaemic strokes and 13,302 (16.3%) and 4,778 (5.8%) were intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhages, respectively. Intracerebral haemorrhage admissions significantly declined by an average of 2.2% annually (95% Confidence Interval=-3.5% to -0.9%) (p<0.001). Thirty-day mortality rates significantly declined for ischaemic stroke (Average Percentage Change -2.9%, 95% Confidence Interval=-5.2% to -1.0%) (p=0.004) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (Average Percentage Change=-2.6%, 95% Confidence Interval=-4.8% to -0.2%) (p=0.04). Mortality at 365-days amongst 30-day survivors of ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage was stable over time and increased in 30-day survivors of subarachnoid haemorrhage (Annual Percentage Change 6.2%, 95% Confidence Interval=-0.1% to 12.8%), although the increase was not statistically significant (p=0.05).
Conclusion: Improved prevention may have underpinned declining intracerebral haemorrhage rates while gains in survival suggest that innovations in stroke care are being successfully translated. Longer-term mortality in patients surviving the acute period is unchanged and may be increasing for subarachnoid haemorrhage warranting investment in post-discharge care and secondary prevention.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.20016899v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.20016899v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Epidemiology

Participants: A diverse sample of 13,888 psychiatric patients extracted from South London and Maudsley electronic health records database and 3,920 control participants extracted from National Health and Nutrition Survey (2015-2016) were included in the study.
Primary and secondary outcome measures: Primary: NLR levels in patients with mental health diagnoses, NLR between patients with different mental health diagnoses. Secondary: Relationship of NLR to length of hospitalisation and to mortality.
Results: NLR was elevated compared to controls in patients with diagnoses including dementia, alcohol dependence, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depression, non-phobic anxiety disorders, and mild mental retardation (p < 0.05). NLR also correlated with age, antipsychotic use and hypnotic use. NLR was found to be higher in individuals of White ethnicity and lower in individuals of Black ethnicity. Elevated NLR was associated with increased mortality ( = 0.103, p = 2.9e-08) but not with hospital admissions or face-to-face contacts.
Conclusions: Elevated NLR may reflect a transdiagnostic pathological process occurring in a subpopulation of psychiatric patients. NLR may be useful to identify and stratify patients who could benefit from adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016790v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016790v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Informative Frailty Indices from Binarized Biomarkers","Frailty indices (FI) based on continuous valued health data, such as obtained from blood and urine tests, have been shown to be predictive of adverse health outcomes. However, creating FI from such biomarker data requires a binarization treatment that is difficult to standardize across studies. In this work, we explore a ""quantile"" methodology for the generic treatment of biomarker data that allows us to construct an FI without preexisting medical knowledge (i.e. risk thresholds) of the included biomarkers. We show that our quantile approach performs as well as, or even slightly better than, established methods for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) data sets. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust to cohort effects within studies as compared to other data-based methods. The success of our binarization approaches provides insight into the robustness of the FI as a health measure, the upper limits of the FI observed in various data sets, and  highlights general difficulties in obtaining absolute scales for comparing FI between studies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016816v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016816v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Health Informatics

"High prevalence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) type 66 in low-grade cervical lesions of Mexican women","Background: HPV-16 infections constitute the highest risk for developing uterine cervix cancer. However, the role of other high-risk types is still controversial.  
Objective: To analyze HR-HPV prevalence and its possible associations between HPV and risk factors related to cervical lesions among Mexican women.
Methods:  Cross sectional study using 362 cervical samples collected between 2016 and 2017. Fourteen HR-HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68) were detected by highly sensitive PCR amplification followed by reverse hybridization. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the association between HPV types and risk factors among lesions.
Results: Most samples were HR-HPV positive (83.43%). HPV-16 was the most prevalent infection among negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy (78.6%), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (50%), and cervical cancer (58.2%). HPV-66 showed an unexpected high prevalence in atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (50%), low-grade squamous intraepithelial (45.7%), and only found in 3.6% of cervical cancers. HPV-16 was significantly prevalent among women between 30-39 years, whereas types 66 and 52 were significantly associated when previously sexually transmitted disease had occurred (p< 0.05).
Conclusions: HPV-66 either in single or co-infection with other HR-HPV types (excluding 16 and 18) might be indicative of non-progressive cancer lesions. HPV-66 prevalence was unusually high in low-grade cervical lesions, predominantly in co-infection with HPV-51, and very low among cervical cancer. This should be addressed to interpret results obtained by methods that group type 66 with other HR-types.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016857v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016857v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Obstetrics and Gynecology

"Clinical presentation and differential splicing of SRSF2, U2AF1 and SF3B1 mutations in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia","Previous studies have demonstrated that splicing factor mutations are recurrent events in hematopoietic malignancies. Their clinical characteristics and aberrant splicing patterns have been explored in myelodysplasia, however, their functional consequences in acute myeloid leukaemia are largely unknown. The aim of this study was the comprehensive clinical and functional analysis of mutations in the three most commonly afflicted splicing factor genes: SRSF2, U2AF1 and SF3B1. To this end, we examined the prognostic role of splicing factor mutations in two large independent cohorts, encompassing a total of 2678 acute myeloid leukaemia patients treated with intensive chemotherapy. The clinical analysis was complemented by RNA-sequencing of 246 patients to identify targets of splicing dysregulation. Results were validated in an additional RNA-sequencing dataset of 177 patients. Patients with splicing factor mutations show inferior relapse-free and overall survival, however, these mutations do not represent independent prognostic markers. Differential isoform expression analysis revealed a characteristic expression profile for each splicing factor mutation with a strong dysregulation of several isoforms. Furthermore, by establishing a custom differential splice junction usage pipeline we accurately detected aberrant splicing in splicing factor mutated samples. Mutated samples were characterized by predominantly decreased splice junction utilization of a large number of genes. A large proportion of differentially used spliced junctions were novel. Targets of splicing dysregulation included several genes with a known role in acute myeloid leukaemia. In SRSF2(P95H) mutants we further explored the possibility of a cascading effect through the dysregulation of the splicing pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that splicing factor mutations does not represent independent prognostic markers. However, they do have genome-wide consequences on gene splicing leading to dysregulated isoform expression of several genes.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016881v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016881v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Hematology

"High levels of mild to moderate depression among men who have sex with men and transgender women in Lima, Peru: implications for integrated depression and HIV care","Depression disproportionally affects people at risk of acquiring or living with HIV and is associated with worse health outcomes; however, depression care is not routinely integrated with HIV prevention and treatment services. Selection of the best depression intervention(s) for integration depends both on the prevalence and severity of depression among potential users. To inform depression care integration in a community-based setting in Lima, Peru, we retrospectively analyzed routinely collected depression screening data from men who have sex with men and transgender women seeking HIV prevention and care services (N=185). Depression was screened for using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Prevalence of any depression (PHQ-9 =5) was 42% and was significantly associated with the last sexual partner being casual (p=0.01). Most (81%) depressive symptoms were mild to moderate (=5 PHQ-9 =14). Integrating depression care with HIV prevention and treatment services in Peru should begin by implementing interventions targeting mild to moderate depression.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016808v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016808v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Virtual reality telerehabilitation for spatial neglect post-stroke: perspectives from stroke survivors, carers and clinicians","Spatial neglect is a common and severe cognitive consequence of stroke, yet there is currently no effective rehabilitation tool. Virtual Reality (VR) telerehabilitation tools have the potential to provide multisensory and enjoyable neuropsychological therapies and remotely monitor adherence without the presence of a therapist at all times. In order to inform the development of these tools researchers and industry need to better understand end-user perspectives about these technologies to ensure these are acceptable and user-friendly to ultimately optimize adherence and efficacy. Therefore, this study explored end-user perspectives on the use of self-administered VR telerehabilitation for spatial neglect. We used a mixed-method design including focus groups, self-administered questionnaires and individual interviews with stroke survivors (N = 7), their carers (N = 3) and stroke clinicians (N = 6). End-user perspectives identified clarity of instructions, equipment (cost, available resources) and for some, level of experience with technology as barriers of use. Perceived facilitators of use were performance feedback, engagement and enjoyment, and psychological benefits associated by self-administered VR telerehabilitation. Overall, end-users were positive and interested in using VR telerehabilitation for spatial neglect. These perspectives enabled us to produce practical recommendations to inform future development, enhance engagement and uptake of self-administered VR telerehabilitation.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016782v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016782v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Circulating tumor cell characterization of lung cancer brain metastasis in the cerebrospinal fluid through single-cell transcriptome analysis","Metastatic lung cancer accounts for about half of the brain metastases (BM). Development of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) are becoming increasingly common, and its prognosis is still poor despite the advances in systemic and local approaches. Until now, the cytology analysis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains the gold diagnostic standard. Although several previous studies performed in CSF have offered great promise for the diagnostics and therapeutics of LM, a comprehensive characterization of CTCs in CSF is still lacking. To fill this critical gap of lung adenocarcinoma leptomeningeal metastases (LUAD-LM), we analyzed the transcriptomes of 1,375 cells from 5 LUAD-LM patient and 3 control samples using single-cell RNA sequencing technology. We defined CSF-CTCs based on abundant expression of epithelial markers and genes with lung origin, as well as the enrichment of metabolic pathway and cell adhesion molecules, which are crucial for the survival and metastases of tumor cells. Elevated expression of CEACAM6 and SCGB3A2 was discovered in CSF-CTCs, which could serve as candidate biomarkers of LUAD-LM. We revealed substantial heterogeneity in CSF-CTCs among LUAD-LM patients and within patient among individual cells. Cell-cycle gene expression profiles and the proportion of CTCs displaying mesenchymal and cancer stem cell properties also vary among patients. In addition, CSF-CTC transcriptome profiling identified one LM case as cancer of unknown primary site (CUP). Our results will shed light on the mechanism of LUAD-LM and provide a new direction of diagnostic test of LUAD-LM and CUP cases from CSF samples.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016683v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016683v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Oncology

"Autoantibodies to the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor in Adolescents with Early Onset Psychosis and Healthy Controls","Background:  
Autoantibodies to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR-Abs) in autoimmune encephalitis have been associated with prominent psychiatric symptoms. The aims of the present study are to identify the prevalence of NMDAR-Abs in adolescents with early onset psychosis disorders (EOP) and healthy controls (HC) and examine its clinical significance.
Method: 
Plasma samples were acquired from 46 adolescent EOP patients and 69 age- and sex matched HC, and assessed for the presence of immunoglobulin G NMDAR-Abs. All participants underwent psychiatric evaluation, neurological examination and head magnetic resonance imaging.
Results: 
NMDAR-Abs were detected in three of 46 (6.5%) EOP patients and in two of 69 (2.9%) HC. One NMDAR-Abs EOP patient presented with unusual psychopathology and minor T1 weighted lesions of vasculopathological origin located bi-frontally and in the basal ganglia, and had a recent diagnosis of a separate autoimmune disease. One NMDAR-Abs HC displayed a T2 weighted FLAIR hyperintensity lesion in the left frontal lobe. The remaining three NMDAR-Abs participants were two EOP patients without neurological or radiological findings, and one HC without any clinical findings. 
Conclusions: 
We report the presence of NMDAR-Abs in both adolescent EOP patients and HC, similar to the incidence in other studies. This may support the hypothesis of an immunological disease component in a small proportion of adolescent psychosis, but the positive antibody tests must be carefully interpreted and reviewed within the individual clinical context.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016626v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016626v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"A Combined HLA Molecular Mismatch and Expression Analysis for Evaluating HLA-DPB1 de novo Donor-Specific Antibody Risk in Pediatric Solid Organ Transplantation: Implications for Solid Organ & Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation","Background. HLA molecular mismatch (MM) has been shown to be a risk factor for de novo donor-specific antibody (dnDSA) development in solid organ transplantation (SOT). HLA expression differences have also been associated with adverse outcomes in hematopoietic cell transplantation. We sought to study both MM and expression in assessing dnDSA risk.
Methods. One-hundred-and-three HLA-DP-mismatched SOT pairs were retrospectively analysed. MM was computed using amino acids (aa), eplets and, supplementarily, Grantham/Epstein scores. DPB1 alleles were classified as rs9277534-A (low-expression) or -G (high-expression) linked. To determine the associations between risk factors and dnDSA, logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and population-based analyses were performed.
Results. A high-risk AA:GX (recipient:donor) expression combination (X=A or G) demonstrated strong association with DP-dnDSA (p=0.001). MM was also associated with DP-dnDSA when evaluated by itself (eplet_p=0.007, aa_p=0.003, Grantham_p=0.005, Epstein_p=0.004). When attempting to determine the relative individual effects of the risk factors in multivariable analysis, only AA:GX expression status retained a strong association (RR=18.6, p=0.007 with eplet; RR=15.8, p=0.02 with aa), while MM was no longer significant (eplet_p=0.56, aa_p=0.51). Importantly, these risk factors are correlated, due to LD between the expression-tagging SNP and polymorphisms along HLA-DPB1.
Conclusions. The MM and expression risk factors each appear to be strong predictors of DP-dnDSA and to possess clinical utility; however, the two risk factors are closely correlated. These metrics may represent distinct ways of characterizing a common overlapping dnDSA risk profile, but they are not independent. Further, we demonstrate the importance and detailed implications of LD effects in risk assessment of dnDSA and possibly transplantation overall.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016709v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016709v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Transplantation

"Polygenic modelling of treatment effect heterogeneity","Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic variants to assess the effect of intervening on a risk factor using observational data. We consider the scenario in which there is a pharmacomimetic (that is, treatment-mimicking) genetic variant that can be used as a proxy for a particular pharmacological treatment that changes the level of the risk factor. If the association of the pharmacomimetic genetic variant with the risk factor is stronger in one subgroup of the population, then we may expect the effect of the treatment to be stronger in that subgroup. We test for gene--gene interactions in the associations of variants with a modifiable risk factor, where one genetic variant is treated as pharmacomimetic and the other as an effect modifier, to find genetic subgroups of the population with different predicted response to treatment. If individual genetic variants that are strong effect modifiers cannot be found, moderating variants can be combined using a random forest of interaction trees method into a polygenic response score, analogous to a polygenic risk score for risk prediction. We illustrate the application of the method to investigate effect heterogeneity in the effect of statins on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016618v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016618v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"A Cross-Sectional Survey on Smartphone Usage Pattern, the Level of Mobile Phone Dependence and Psychosocial Effects among Undergraduate Students in a Malaysian University.","Objective: Problematic smartphone use (PSU) is the development of pathological dependence at the expense of performing activities of daily living, thus having a negative health and psychosocial impact on the users. Previous PSU studies focused on medical students and little is known regarding its effect on students undergoing other fields of study. The objective of this study is to identify the pattern of smartphone usage and determine the psychosocial factors affecting PSU among undergraduate students in Malaysia and compare the pattern among different fields of study. Method: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted using validated Smartphone Addiction Scale -Malay version (SAS -M) questionnaire. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the correlation between the patterns of smartphone usage among the students categorised by their ethnic groups, hand dominance and by their field of study. MLR analysis was applied to predict PSU based on socio-demographic data, smartphone usage patterns, psychosocial factors and field of study. Results: A total of 1060 students completed the questionnaire. The majority of students had PSU (60.7%). Students used smartphones predominantly to access SNAs, namely Instagram. Longer duration on the smartphone per day (>9 hours), age at first using a smartphone and depression carried higher risk of developing PSU, whereas the field of study (science vs. arts based) did not contribute to an increased risk of developing PSU.Conclusion: Findings from this study can help better inform university administrators about atrisk groups of undergraduate students who may benefit from targeted intervention designed to re-duce their addictive behavior patterns.

"Potential Test-Negative Case-Control Study Bias in Outbreak Settings: Application to Ebola vaccination in Democratic Republic of Congo","Background:

Infectious disease outbreaks present unique challenges to study designs for vaccine evaluation. Test-negative case-control (TNCC) studies have been used to estimate vaccine efficacy previously, and have been proposed for Ebola virus disease (EVD) vaccines. However, there are key differences in how cases and controls are recruited during outbreaks that have implications for the reliability of vaccine efficacy estimates from these studies.

Methods:

We use a modelling approach to quantify TNCC bias for a prophylactic vaccine distributed across varying study and epidemiological scenarios. Our model accounts for vaccine distribution heterogeneity and for the two potential routes of recruitment: self-reporting and contact-tracing. We derive the TNCC estimator for this model and suggest ways to translate outbreak response data into the parameters of the model.

Result:

We found systematic biases in vaccine estimates from a TNCC study in our model of outbreak conditions. Biases are introduced due to differential recruitment from self-report and contact-tracing, and by clustering of participation in vaccination. We estimate the magnitude of these biases, and highlight options to manage them via restricted recruitment. For the motivating example of EVD, the absolute bias should be less 10%.

Conclusion:

A TNCC study may generate biased estimates of vaccine efficacy during outbreaks. Bias can be limited via recruitment that either minimizes heterogeneity in vaccination in the recruited population or excludes recruitment of contact-traced individuals. TNCC studies for outbreak infections should record the reason for testing to quantify potential bias in the vaccine efficacy estimate. Perfectly distinguishing the recruitment route may be difficult in practice, so it will be challenging to entirely remove this bias.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016576v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016576v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Epidemiology

"FDA orphan drug designations for lysosomal storage disorders - a cross sectional analysis","Purpose: To provide a quantitative clinical-regulatory insight into the status of FDA orphan drug designations for compounds intended to treat lysosomal storage disorders (LSD's).
Methods: Assessment of the drug pipeline through analysis of the FDA database for orphan drug designations with descriptive and comparative statistics.
Results: Between 1983 and 2019, 124 orphan drug designations were granted by the FDA for compounds intended to treat 28 lysosomal storage diseases. Orphan drug designations focused on Gaucher disease (N=16), Pompe disease (N=16), Fabry disease (N=10), MPS II (N=10), MPS I (N=9), and MPS IIIA (N=9), and included enzyme replacement therapies, gene therapies, and small molecules, and others. Twenty-three orphan drugs were approved for the treatment of 11 LSDs. Gaucher disease (N=6), cystinosis (N=5), Pompe disease (N=3), and Fabry disease (N=2) had multiple approvals, CLN2, LAL-D, MPS I, II, IVA, VI, and VII one approval each. This is an increase of nine more approved drugs and four more treatable LSD's (CLN2, MPS VII, LAL-D, and MPS IVA) since 2013. Mean time between orphan drug designation and FDA approval was 89.7 SD 55.00 (range 8-203, N=23) months.
Conclusions: The development pipeline is growing and evolving into diversified small molecules and gene therapy. CLN2 was the first and only LSD with an approved therapy directly targeted to the brain. Newly approved products included ""me-too"" - enzymes and innovative compounds such as the first pharmacological chaperone for the treatment of Fabry disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.05.20016568v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.05.20016568v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Psychiatric symptoms and syndromes transcending diagnostic boundaries in multiplex families","The Accelerator program for discovery in brain disorders using stem cells (ADBS) is an ongoing longitudinal study investigating the neurobiological aspects of five psychiatric disorders. This article explores the frequency of manifestations of different psychiatric symptoms and syndromes in the participants and their relatives from this multiplex family-based study.  Families with two or more first-degree relatives (FDRs) with either Alzheimer's dementia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder or schizophrenia were identified, and all those who consented to participate from these families were evaluated. We screened 3,583 families between August 2016 and October 2019 and enrolled 481 families (1406 participants; 773 affected with any of the 5 disorders, and relatives) in ADBS. The participants had a very high familial prevalence with nearly a third of FDRs affected. Though similar disorders aggregated within the families, the majority (61%) of the families had members with dissimilar diagnoses. Approximately 15% of affected participants had been diagnosed to have two or more co-occurring syndromes over their lifetime. Diverse cross-cutting symptoms, not restricted to the index syndrome, were observed in participants across diagnostic categories. The pattern and extent of co-occurrence validate the need for a transdiagnostic approach accounting for the presence of various psychiatric manifestations in the individuals and their families. The espoused cohort will be useful for genetics, molecular and neurobiological evaluation of neuropsychiatric conditions.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016543v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016543v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Insulin pricing and other major diabetes-related concerns in the USA: A study of 46,400 Tweets between 2017 and 2019","Objective
Little is known about the concerns of people living with diabetes. This study aims to identify key diabetes-related concerns in the USA and primary emotions associated with those concerns using information shared on Twitter.

Research Design and Methods
A total of 11.7 million diabetes-related tweets in English were collected between April 2017 and July 2019. Machine learning methods were used to filter tweets with personal content, to geolocate (to the US) and to identify clusters of tweets with emotional elements. A sentiment analysis was then applied to each cluster.

Results
We identified 46,400 tweets with emotional elements in the USA from which 30 clusters were identified; five clusters (18% of tweets) were related to insulin pricing with both positive emotions (joy, love) referring to advocacy for affordable insulin and sadness emotions related to the frustration of insulin prices, five clusters (12% of tweets) to solidarity and support with a majority of joy and love emotions expressed. The most negative topics (10% of tweets) were related to diabetes distress (24% sadness, 27% anger, 21% fear elements), to diabetic and insulin shocks (45% anger, 46% fear) and comorbidities (40% sadness).

Conclusions
Our work has enabled us to describe the main topics of interest about diabetes and their associated emotions. Insulin pricing is a central diabetes-related concern and is associated with feelings of sadness. Social media data are complementary to traditional diabetes epidemiology and can contribute to public decision making around key topics of interest around diabetes.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016527v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016527v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Epidemiology

"A Computational Approach for Exploring Herbal Inhibitors of Acetylcholinesterase in Alzheimer's Disease","Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of age related dementia. Many hypotheses shed light on several reasons that lead to AD development. The cholinergic hypothesis describes that destruction of an essential neurotransmitter, acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, leads to the AD onset. The hydrolysis of acetylcholine by excess amount of AChE decreases the amount of acetylcholine in the brain, thus interfering with the normal brain functions. Many anti- AChE agents can be used to treat AD by targeting AChE. In our study, 14 anti- AChE agents from plants: 1,8-cineol, berberine, carvacrol, cheilanthifoline, coptisine, estragole, harmaline, harmine, liriodenine, myrtenal, naringenin, protopine, scoulerine, stylopine were tested against AChE and compared with two controls: donepezil and galantamine, using different techniques of molecular docking. Molecular docking study was conducted for all the 14 selected ligands against AChE to identify the best three ligands among them. To determine the safety and efficacy of the three best ligands, a set of tests: the druglikeness property test, ADME/T test, PASS & P450 site of metabolism prediction, pharmacophore mapping and modelling and DFT calculations were performed. In our experiment, berberine, coptisine and naringenin were determined as the three ligands from the docking study. Further analysis of these 3 ligands showed coptisine as the most potent anti-AChE agent. The molecular dynamics simulation study showed quite results for the coptisine- AChE docked complex. Administration of berberine, coptisine and naringenin could be potential treatments for AD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016535v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016535v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Pharmacology and Therapeutics

We have developed a method called the signal intensity coefficient that uses echocardiographic texture analysis to quantify microstructural changes which may occur in at-risk patients prior to development of a clinical heart failure syndrome.
Methods: Participants from the Framingham Offspring Cohort study who attended the 8th visit and received screening echocardiography were included. Participants were followed for a mean of 7.4 years for incident congestive heart failure. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess the hazard ratio of signal intensity coefficient in the top quartile of values versus other quartiles in the total and sex-stratified population.
Results: 2511 participants with interpretable echocardiography and no history of congestive heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction were included in this study. The top quartile signal intensity coefficient had a hazard ratio of 1.83 (p=0.0048) for incident heart failure. When additional clinical risk factors were added to the model, this became non-significant. Within women, an elevated hazard ratio was significant in multiple models including age and hypertensive medication use. Models were not significant in men.
Conclusions: Elevated signal intensity coefficient is associated with an increased risk of incident congestive heart failure. This trend remains significant in women after inclusion of age and hypertensive medication use. The signal intensity coefficient may be able to identify patients at risk of developing congestive heart failure using echocardiographic texture analysis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016477v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016477v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Beyond T Staging in the Treat All Era: Capturing the Severity and Heterogeneity of Kaposi's Sarcoma in East Africa","Background: In the treat-all era of HIV, Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) remains one of the most incident cancers in sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of patients with KS are diagnosed at advanced disease stage in this setting. Staging systems for KS, specifically the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) system, were developed in the pre-ART era, were not meant to guide treatment, and may not fully capture the clinical heterogeneity of advanced disease. There is no international consensus on which KS patients need chemotherapy in addition to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Understanding KS severity of disease in the current era would help to inform prognosis and clarify treatment guidelines.
Methods: We performed rapid case ascertainment (RCA) on people living with HIV =18 years old newly diagnosed with biopsy-proven KS from 2016 to 2019 at three clinic sites in Kenya and Uganda. As close as possible to time of diagnosis, we performed a structured interview, physical examination, and collection of laboratory specimens. We reported KS severity using ACTG and WHO staging criteria, as well as detailed measurements not captured in current staging systems.
Results: We enrolled 264 adults newly diagnosed with KS. RCA was performed within 1 month of KS diagnosis for 62% of patients and within 6 months for 73% of patients.  Patients were 61% Kenyan, 69% male, and with a median age of 35. Median CD4 count was 239 (IQR 87 to 408), with 72% of patients initiating ART greater than 60 days prior to diagnosis. The majority of patients had advanced stage of disease, with 82% qualifying as ACTG T1 and 64% as WHO Severe/Symptomatic KS. There was marked heterogeneity within advanced KS, with 25% of patients having two ACTG qualifiers and 3% of patients had three or more ACTG qualifiers.
Conclusion: The majority of patients with KS in this study had advanced stage disease at time of diagnosis, highlighting the need to improve early diagnosis of KS. Within this group of advanced stage patients was large clinical heterogeneity, leading to questions about whether all patients with advanced KS require the same treatment strategy.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016519v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016519v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","HIV/AIDS

"Portable Objective Diagnostics using Visual Evoked Potentials for Age-related Macular Degeneration","Delayed Dark Adapted vision Recovery (DAR) is a biomarker for Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD); however, its measurement is burdensome for patients and examiners. We developed a portable, wireless, quick-setup system that employs a headset with a smartphone to deliver and analyze controlled dichoptic photobleach and pattern reversal stimuli, and with custom electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes, to measure objective Dark Adapted Visual Evoked Potentials (DAVEP) at multiple locations of the visual field in one comfortable 20-minute session, without requiring subject reporting. DAVEP responses post photobleach (up to 15 minutes), were measured concurrently in both eyes of 13 patients with AMD and 8 others not diagnosed with AMD. New unexpected features were observed in the DAVEP responses at high latencies to scotopic stimulus intensities. The amplitude recovery of the DAVEP response was significantly delayed in AMD patients compared with controls. We developed DAVEP1 scores, a simple metric for DAR, using it to successfully identify all 100% of AMD subjects and correctly classify 90% of subject eyes. Deficits in DAR in patients with AMD can be identified with this objective VEP based system using the DAVEP1 metric, a promising new objective biomarker for this disease that can be easily tested in a clinic.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016451v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016451v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Ophthalmology

"Genetic hearing impairment affects cochlear processing and, consequently, speech recognition in noise","The relation between speech recognition and hereditary hearing loss is not straightforward. Impaired cochlear processing of sound might be determined by underlying genetic defects. Data obtained in nine groups of patients with a specific type of genetic hearing loss were evaluated. For each group, the affected cochlear structure, or site-of-lesion, was determined based on previously published animal studies. Retrospectively obtained speech recognition scores in noise were related to several aspects of supra-threshold cochlear processing, as assessed by psychophysical measurements. The differences in speech perception in noise between these patient groups could be explained by these factors, and partially by the hypothesized affected structure of the cochlea, suggesting that speech recognition in noise was associated with genetics-related malfunctioning of the cochlea.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.19015826v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.19015826v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Otolaryngology

"A blood miRNA signature associates with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease diagnosis and rate of progression","Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) presents as a rapidly progressive dementia which is usually fatal within six months. No blood tests are currently available for diagnosis or disease monitoring. Here, we profile blood microRNA (miRNA) expression in sCJD. Small RNA-sequencing of 57 sCJD patients and 50 healthy controls reveals differential expression of hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, hsa-miR-106b-3p and hsa-let-7d-3p. Downregulation of hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p and hsa-miR-93-5p in sCJD replicates in an independent cohort using quantitative PCR, with concomitant upregulation of four of their mRNA targets. This miRNA signature discriminates patients with sCJD from Alzheimers disease patients. Finally, longitudinal monitoring of 15 sCJD patients shows that the rate of decline in miRNA expression significantly correlates with rate of disease progression. These findings highlight novel molecular alterations in human prion disease outside the central nervous system which can provide information about diagnosis, disease progression, and improve mechanistic understanding of sCJD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.19015214v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.19015214v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Neurology

"Impact of Nativity Status on Dietary Behavior and Obesity Among US Adults","Background/Objectives: Non-communicable diseases and chronic conditions such as obesity continue to emerge as public health crises in the United States (US) and globally. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate how U.S. immigrants compare to native-born adults regarding obesity-related behavior such as dietary intake. 

Subjects/Methods: The Health Information National Trends Survey was analyzed for this study. The survey was conducted between September and December 2013. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were utilized for covariates of interest.

Results: 3131 respondents were included in the analysis. Mean age was 54.68 years (SD +/- 16.5) with a female preponderance (61%). Majority were native-born (83%). About 25% of the immigrants were obese, compared to 34% of non-immigrants. After adjusting for gender, age group, race/ethnicity, level of education, marital status and income category, immigrants were more likely to take some quantity of fruit daily (aOR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.07 - 3.32; p = 0.0290); and less likely to consume soda every week (adjusted OR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55 - 0.98; p = 0.0383). Compared to Caucasians, Hispanics (aOR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.50 - 2.65; p <.0001) and Blacks (aOR = 2.76; 95% CI: 2.08 - 3.64; p <.0001) were more likely to consume soda on a weekly basis.

Conclusion: U.S. immigrants are less likely to be obese, and they have healthier dietary behavior compared to non-immigrants. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of various socio-economic, demographic and cultural factors that impact determinants of obesity.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.19015735v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.19015735v1.full.pdf","2020-01-10","Public and Global Health

"Taxonomic Signatures of Long-Term Mortality Risk in Human Gut Microbiota","The collection of fecal material and developments in sequencing technologies have enabled cost-efficient, standardized, and non-invasive gut microbiome profiling. As a result, microbiome composition data from several large cohorts have been cross-sectionally linked to various lifestyle factors and diseases. In spite of these advances, prospective associations between microbiome composition and health have remained uncharacterized due to the lack of sufficiently large and representative population cohorts with comprehensive follow-up data. Here, we analyse the long-term association between gut microbiome variation and mortality in a large, well-phenotyped, and representative population cohort (n = 7211, FINRISK 2002; Finland). We report specific taxonomic and functional signatures related to the Enterobacteriaceae family in the human gut microbiome that predict mortality during a 15-year follow-up. These associations can be observed both in the Eastern and Western Finns who have differing genetic backgrounds, lifestyles, and mortality rates. Our results supplement previously reported cross-sectional associations, and help to establish a methodological and conceptual basis for examining long-term associations between human gut microbiome composition, incident outcomes, and general health status. These findings could serve as a solid framework for microbiome profiling in clinical risk prediction, paving the way towards clinical applications of human microbiome sequencing aimed at prediction, prevention, and treatment of disease.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.19015842v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.19015842v2.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Epidemiology

"rs641738C>T near MBOAT7 promotes steatosis, NASH, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a meta-analysis","A common genetic variant near MBOAT7 (rs641738C>T) has been previously associated with hepatic fat and advanced histology in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), however, these findings have not been consistently replicated in the literature. Therefore, we aimed to establish whether rs641738 is a risk factor for NAFLD through meta-analysis. Data from 134,015 participants (7,692 with liver biopsies and 50,680 with imaging) was included in the meta-analysis. The minor T-allele of rs641738C>T was associated with higher liver fat on CT/MRI using an additive genetic model (+0.05 standard deviations [95% CI: 0.01 - 0.09], p=0.025), and with an increased risk of NAFLD (per-allele OR: 1.08 [95% CI: 1.01 - 1.15]), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (OR: 1.11 [95% CI: 1.02 - 1.21]), advanced fibrosis (OR: 1.14 [95% CI: 1.05 - 1.23]), and hepatocellular carcinoma (OR: 1.43 [95% CI: 1.22 - 1.67]) in adults with NAFLD. Sub-group analysis did not demonstrate a difference in Caucasians and non-Caucasians. Rs641738C>T was not associated with markers of insulin resistance but was associated with higher risk of stroke in the UK Biobank. These data validate rs641738C>T near MBOAT7 as a risk factor for the development, activity, and stage of NAFLD including hepatocellular carcinoma.","/content/10.1101/19013623v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013623v2.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Gastroenterology

"Pushing the limits of recovery in chronic stroke survivors: User perceptions of the Queen Square Upper Limb Neurorehabilitation Programme.","Introduction: The Queen Square Upper Limb (QSUL) Neurorehabilitation Programme is a clinical service within the National Health Service in the United Kingdom that provides 90 hours of therapy over three weeks to stroke survivors with persistent upper limb impairment. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of participants of this programme, including clinicians, stroke survivors and carers. 
Design: Descriptive qualitative.
Setting: Clinical outpatient neurorehabilitation service. 
Participants: Clinicians (physiotherapists, occupational therapists, rehabilitation assistants) involved in the delivery of the QSUL Programme, as well as stroke survivors and carers who had participated in the programme were purposively sampled. Each focus group followed a series of semi-structured, open questions that were tailored to the clinical or stroke group. One independent researcher facilitated all focus groups, which were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed by four researchers using a thematic approach to identify main themes.  
Results: Four focus groups were completed: three including stroke survivors (n = 16) and carers (n = 2), and one including clinicians (n = 11). The main stroke survivor themes related to psychosocial aspects of the programme (<U+2033> you feel valued as an individual <U+2033>), as well as the behavioural training provided (<U+2033> gruelling, yet rewarding& [Prime]). The main clinician themes also included psychosocial aspects of the programme (<U+2033> patient driven ethos - no barriers, no rules <U+2033>), and knowledge, skills and resources of clinicians (<U+2033> it is more than intensity, it is complex <U+2033>). 
Conclusions: As an intervention, the QSUL Programme is both comprehensive and complex. The impact of participation in the programme spans psychosocial and behavioural domains from the perspectives of both the stroke survivor and clinician.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.05.19015099v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.05.19015099v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"The effect of fortifying the spleen, clearing heat, activating blood method on chronic atrophic gastritis: a real-world study","Introduction: Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is a precancerous disease that is difficult to treat. Even after eradication of the Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, complete resolution of the symptoms is difficult to achieve. The fortifying the spleen, clearing heat, activating blood method (FSCHABM) has an excellent curative effect in the treatment of CAG. A real-world study is particularly suitable for researching the treatment of CAG, but there are currently no reports on CAG trials. Our aim is to design a high-quality trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of FSCHABM in treating CAG patients.
Methods and analysis: This protocol is designed as a real-world study for 10 years. A total of 5000 participants will be assigned to a FSCHABM treatment group or a non-FSCHABM treatment group at a 1:1 ratio at the first Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. Patients are given 1-2 courses of a 24-week-long treatment. The participants will be followed up for observation and measurement of the following indicators: the primary outcome is the histopathological indicator; the secondary outcome includes evaluation of gastric lesions, syndrome curative effect, evaluation of symptoms, evaluation of quality of life, evaluation of anxiety and depression, economic evaluation and other indicators. This is the first real-world study evaluating the therapeutic effect of FSCHABM in the treatment of CAG in clinical practice. This protocol can provide a reference for future multi-center, randomized, controlled trials.
Strengths and limitations of this study: it is the first time to carry out TCM study related to CAG by using the real-world study. A large number of patients and a long-term study can effectively reflect the effect of TCM treatment and reduce the bias. The precise research protocol makes the whole research more accurate and reliable. The limitations of implementing this protocol are expending a lot of time, manpower and economic resources inevitably.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.25.19015800v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.25.19015800v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Gastroenterology

"Using text mining to track outbreak trends in global surveillance of emerging diseases: ProMED-mail","Objectives: ProMED-mail (Program for Monitoring Emerging Disease, also abbreviated ProMED) is an international disease outbreak monitoring and early warning system. Every year, users contribute thousands of reports that include reference to infectious diseases and toxins, and these reports are then distributed to all subscribers of ProMED. However, the corpus of reports has not been well studied so far. Thus, we propose to apply text mining methods to derive information pertinent to the characterisation of the stage of an epidemic outbreak from the reports.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in ProMED reports in three steps: reports filtering, keywords extraction from reports and finally word co-occurrence network analysis. The keyword extraction was performed with the TextRank algorithm, keywords co-occurrence networks were then produced using the top keywords from each document and multiple network centrality measures were computed to analyse the co-occurrence networks. We used two major outbreaks in recent years, Ebola 2014 and Zika 2015, as cases to illustrate and validate the process.
Results: We found that the information structures extracted at different stages of outbreaks from ProMED are consistent with response strategies as well as situation reports of the World Health Organisation. 
Conclusion: This study shows that ProMED provides large valuable information to characterise the evolution of epidemic outbreaks. Our research presents a pipeline that can extract and organise this information in a meaningful way. It also highlights the potential for ProMED mail to be utilised in monitoring, evaluating and improving responses to outbreaks.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017145v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017145v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Public and Global Health

"Geographical Disparities in HIV Prevalence among Men Who Have Sex with Men and People Who Inject Drugs in Nigeria","Background: Assessment of geographical heterogeneity of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs (PWID) can usefully inform targeted HIV prevention and care strategies. We aimed to measure HIV prevalence and identify hotspots of HIV infection among MSM and PWID in Nigeria.

Methods: We included all MSM and PWID accessing HIV testing services across seven prioritized states (Lagos, Nasarawa, Akwa Ibom, Cross Rivers, Rivers, Benue and the Federal Capital Territory) in three geographic regions (North Central, South South, South West) between Oct 1, 2016 and Sept 30, 2017. We extracted data from national testing registers, georeferenced all HIV test results aggregated at the level of Local Government Areas (LGAs), and calculated HIV prevalence. We calculated and compared HIV prevalence from our study to the integrated biological and behavioral surveillance survey (IBBSS) 2014 and used global spatial autocorrelation and hotspot analysis to highlight patterns of HIV infection, and to identify areas of significant clustering of HIV cases. 

Findings: A positive HIV test was reported in 12.1% (95%CI 9.7-13.1) and 11.8% (95%CI 9.3-12.7) of the 26,423 MSMs and 9,474 PWIDs, respectively. Global spatial autocorrelation Morans I statistics revealed a clustered distribution of HIV infection among MSMs and PWIDs with a <5% and <1% likelihood that this clustered pattern could be due to chance respectively. Significant clusters of HIV infection (Getis-Ord-Gi* statistics) confined to the North Central, South-South regions were identified among MSM and PWID. Compared to the 2014 IBBSS our results suggest an increased HIV prevalence among PWID and a substantial decrease among MSM.

Interpretation: This study identified geographical areas to prioritize for control of HIV infection among MSM and PWID, thus demonstrating that geographical information system technology is a useful tool to inform public health planning for interventions for epidemic control of HIV infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017103v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017103v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Public and Global Health

"An end-to-end workflow for statistical analysis and inference of large-scale biomedical datasets","Throughout time, as medical and epidemiological studies have grown larger in scale, the challenges associated with extracting useful and relevant information from these data has mounted. General health surveys provide a good example for such studies as they usually cover large populations and are conducted throughout long periods in multiple locations. The challenges associated with interpreting the results of such studies include: the presence of both categorical and continuous variables and the need to compare them within a single statistical framework; the presence of variations in data resulting from the technical limitations in data collection; the danger of selection and information biases in hypothesis-directed study design and implementation; and the complete inadequacy of p values in identifying significant relationships. As a solution to these challenges, we propose an end-to-end analysis workflow using the MUltivariate analysis and VISualization (MUVIS) package within R statistical software. MUVIS consists of a comprehensive set of statistical tools that follow the basic tenet of unbiased exploration of associations within a dataset. We validate its performance by applying MUVIS to data from the Yazd Health Study (YaHS). YaHS is a prospective cohort study consisting of a general health survey of more than 30 health-related measurements and a questionnaire with over 300 questions acquired from 10050 participants. Given the nature of the YaHS dataset, most of the identified associations are corroborated by a large body of medical literature. Nevertheless, some more interesting and less investigated connections were also found which are presented here. We conclude that MUVIS provides a robust statistical framework for extraction of useful and relevant information from medical datasets and their visualization in easily comprehensible ways.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017095v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017095v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Health Informatics

"Dissecting the genetic overlap of education, socioeconomic status, and mental health","Socioeconomic status (SES) and education (EDU) are phenotypically associated with psychiatric disorders and behavior. It remains unclear how these associations influence the genetic risk for mental health traits and EDU/SES individually. Using information from >1 million individuals, we conditioned the genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, personality traits, brain imaging phenotypes, and externalizing behaviors with genome-wide data for EDU/SES. Accounting for EDU/SES significantly affected the observed heritability of psychiatric traits ranging from 2.44% h2 decrease for bipolar disorder to 29.0% h2 decrease for Tourette syndrome. Neuroticism h2 significantly increased by 20.23% after conditioning with SES. After EDU/SES conditioning, novel neuronal cell-types were identified for risky behavior (excitatory), major depression (inhibitory), schizophrenia (excitatory and GABAergic), and bipolar disorder (excitatory). Conditioning with EDU/SES also revealed unidirectional causality between brain morphology and mental health phenotypes. Our results indicate genetic discoveries of mental health outcomes may be limited by genetic overlap with EDU/SES.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017079v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017079v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Diagnostic accuracy of physical examination to detect the pelvic fractures among the blunt trauma patients; systematic review and meta-analysis","Background
The study aims to perform systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the diagnostic accuracy of physical examination for pelvic fracture among the blunt trauma patients.

Method
We will perform a systematic review and meta-analysis for diagnostic test accuracy (DTA). We will include all reports on the diagnostic accuracy of physical examinations for detecting pelvic fractures. We will include the studies designed as prospective or retrospective observational (cohort or cross-sectional) studies or secondary analysis of randomized controlled trials. The target participants are blunt trauma patients with potential pelvic injury. The target condition is pelvic fracture. The index test being investigated is physical examination for pelvic fracture. The reference standard is X-ray or computed tomography to confirm the target condition. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library inclusive of Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Two authors will independently screen the study eligibility and extract data. Screening will be a two-step process with initial title/abstract screening followed by full-text screening. We will evaluate the risk of bias independently by two investigators and reported according to the QUADAS-2 tool. In the meta-analysis, we will use a bivariate random-effects model to report the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) point (summary values for sensitivity and specificity) and the 95% confidence region around the summary ROC point.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017129v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017129v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Emergency Medicine

"Dual mechanisms of ictal high frequency oscillations in rhythmic onset seizures","Objective: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) recorded from intracranial electrodes during epileptiform discharges have been proposed as a biomarker of epileptic brain sites and may also be a useful feature for seizure forecasting, with mixed results. Currently, pathological subclasses of HFOs have been defined primarily by frequency characteristics.  Despite this, there has been limited investigation into the spatial context of HFOs with recruitment of local cortex into seizure discharging. We sought to further understand the biophysical underpinnings of ictal HFOs. 
Methods: Here we examine ictal HFOs from multi-scale electrophysiological recordings during spontaneous human rhythmic onset seizures. We compare features of ictal discharges in both the seizure core and penumbra, as defined by multiunit activity patterns. 
Results: We show marked differences in spectral features, unit coupling, and information theoretic characteristics of HFOs during ictal discharges before and after local seizure invasion.  Furthermore, we tie these timing-related differences to different spatial domains of seizures, showing that eccentric, penumbral discharges are widely distributed and less useful for seizure localization, which may explain the variable utility of HFOs in seizure localization and forecasting.
Interpretation: We thus identify two distinct classes of ictal HFOs, implying two different mechanisms underlying pathological HFOs with contrasting significance for seizure localization.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017053v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017053v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Neurology

While field shape and size is personalized anatomically for all patients, the dose of radiation is still prescribed in a one-size-fits-all manner.
Given the reality of inter-tumoral heterogeneity demonstrated by cancer sequencing efforts, we propose that we are working under an outdated null hypothesis in our field: that all patients should respond the same to the same dose of radiation. 
We have previously developed a method by which to predict optimal dosing for a given patient, which we term the Genomically Adjusted Radiation Dose, given the \textit{a priori} knowledge of a patient's tumor genomics.
Knowing how much dose a patient's tumor requires for biological optimization provides the first opportunity to characterize the inefficienies of one-size-fits-all dosing schemes, that result in both over- and under-dosing for the majority of patients.
To elucidate this inefficiency, and therefore the opportunity to improvement using a personalized dosing scheme, we develop a competing hazards-style mathematical model combining the canonical equations for tumor control and normal tissue complication probabilities.
Using data from two prospectively collected cohorts of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, we show how the results of a recent uniform dose escalation study can be explained by the biological innefficiency of empiric uniform dose escalation, and highlight the opportunities for improvement in radiation outcomes available today, without need for new technology or equipment.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017046v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017046v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Oncology

"The closed eye harbors a unique microbiome in dry eye disease","Dry eye affects millions of individuals. In experimental models, dry eye disease is associated with T helper cell 17-mediated inflammation of the ocular surface that may cause persistent damage to the corneal epithelium. However, the initiating and perpetuating factors associated with chronic inflammation of the ocular surface remain unclear. The ocular microbiota alters ocular surface inflammation and may influence dry eye disease development and progression. Here, we collected serial samples of closed eye tears during a randomized clinical trial of a non-pharmaceutical dry eye therapy and used 16S rRNA metabarcoding to characterize the microbiome. We show the closed dry eye microbiome is distinct from the healthy closed eye microbiome. The ocular microbiome was described only recently, and this report implicates a distinct microbiome in ocular disease development. Our findings suggest an interplay between microbial commensals and inflammation on the ocular surface. This information may inform future studies of the pathophysiological mechanisms of dry eye disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.20016865v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.20016865v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Ophthalmology

"Middle-aged individuals may be in a perpetual state of H3N2 influenza virus susceptibility","Most humans are infected with influenza viruses by 3-4 years of age and have high antibody titers against viral strains encountered early in life. Early childhood influenza exposures can leave lifelong immunological imprints that affect how an individual responds to antigenically distinct viral strains later in life. H3N2 influenza viruses began circulating in humans in 1968 and have evolved substantially over the past 51 years. Therefore, an individual's birth year largely predicts which specific type of H3N2 virus they first encountered in childhood. Here, we completed a large serological survey to elucidate the specificity of antibodies against contemporary H3N2 viruses in differently aged individuals who were likely primed with different H3N2 strains in childhood. We found that most humans who were first infected in childhood with H3N2 viral strains from the 1960s and 1970s possess non-neutralizing antibodies against contemporary 3c2.A H3N2 viruses. Most importantly, we found that 3c2.A H3N2 virus infections boost non-neutralizing H3N2 antibodies in middle-aged individuals, potentially leaving many of them in a perpetual state of 3c2.A H3N2 viral susceptibility.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017038v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017038v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"The ocrelizumab phase II extension trial suggests the potential to improve the risk:benefit balance in multiple sclerosis","Objective: Ocrelizumab inhibits relapsing multiple sclerosis when administered every six months. Based on potential similar memory B cell depletion mechanisms with cladribine and alemtuzumab, we hypothesised that CD20-depletion of B cells by ocrelizumab may exhibit a duration of response exceeding the current licenced treatment interval.
Methods: Internet-located information from regulatory submissions and meeting reports relating to the unpublished open-label, phase II ocrelizumab extension trial (NCT00676715) were reviewed. This followed people (54-55/arm) with MS, who switched from placebo or interferon-beta to ocrelizumab for three 600mg treatment cycles (week 24, 48, 72) or people treated with ocrelizumab for four 600mg treatment cycles (week 0-72), followed by an 18 month treatment-free period.
Results: CD19+ B cells were rapidly depleted within 2 weeks and slow CD19+ B cell repopulation began about 6 months after the last infusion with median-repletion of over 15 months. The reduced annualized relapse rate during the published efficacy study appeared to be maintained in the extension study and there were no new T1 gadolinium-enhancing or T2 lesions detected in the treatment-free period. Importantly, within these extension cohorts, there appeared to be fewer adverse events and infections events. Conclusions:  Ocrelizumab appears to induce durable relapsing disease inhibition, within 3 treatment cycles Therefore, it may be possible to reduce the frequency of dosing to maintain efficacy, whilst limiting infection and other risks associated with continuous immunosuppression. Further studies are now clearly required to determine whether this data is robust, as few people seemed to complete the study.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20016774v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20016774v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Neurology

"Expanding cancer predisposition genes with ultra-rare cancer-exclusive human variations","It is estimated that up to 10% of cancer incidents are attributed to inherited genetic alterations. Despite extensive research, there are still gaps in our understanding of genetic predisposition to cancer. It was theorized that ultra-rare variants partially account for the missing heritable component. We harness the UK BioBank dataset of ~500,000 individuals, 14% of which were diagnosed with cancer, to detect ultra-rare, possibly high-penetrance cancer predisposition variants. We report on 115 cancer-exclusive ultra-rare variations (CUVs) and nominate 26 variants with additional independent evidence as cancer predisposition variants. We conclude that population cohorts are valuable source for expanding the collection of novel cancer predisposition genes.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.19015867v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.19015867v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Oncology

"Machine learning approaches for fracture risk assessment: a comparative analysis of genomic and phenotypic data in 5,130 older men","The study aims were to develop fracture prediction models by using machine learning approaches and genomic data, as well as to identify the best modeling approach for fracture prediction. The genomic data of Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, cohort Study (n=5,130), was analyzed. After a comprehensive genotype imputation, genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated from 1,103 associated SNPs for each participant. Data were normalized and split into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%) for analysis. Random forest, gradient boosting, neural network, and logistic regression were used to develop prediction models for major osteoporotic fractures separately, with GRS, bone density and other risk factors as predictors. For model training, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique was used to account for low fracture rate, and 10-fold cross-validation was employed for hyperparameters optimization. In the testing set, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and accuracy were used to assess the model performance. The McNemar test was employed for pairwise comparisons to examine the accuracy difference between models. The results showed that the prediction performance of gradient boosting was the best, with AUC of 0.71 and an accuracy of 0.88, and the GRS ranked as the 7th most important variable in the model. The performance of random forest and neural network were also better than that of logistic regression. Pairwise comparisons showed that the accuracy difference between models was significant. This study suggested that improving fracture prediction can be achieved by incorporating genetic profiling and by utilizing the gradient boosting approach.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20016659v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20016659v1.full.pdf","2020-01-13","Occupational and Environmental Health

"FDA orphan drug designations for lysosomal storage disorders - a cross sectional analysis","Purpose: To provide a quantitative clinical-regulatory insight into the status of FDA orphan drug designations for compounds intended to treat lysosomal storage disorders (LSD's).
Methods: Assessment of the drug pipeline through analysis of the FDA database for orphan drug designations with descriptive and comparative statistics.
Results: Between 1983 and 2019, 124 orphan drug designations were granted by the FDA for compounds intended to treat 28 lysosomal storage diseases. Orphan drug designations focused on Gaucher disease (N=16), Pompe disease (N=16), Fabry disease (N=10), MPS II (N=10), MPS I (N=9), and MPS IIIA (N=9), and included enzyme replacement therapies, gene therapies, and small molecules, and others. Twenty-three orphan drugs were approved for the treatment of 11 LSDs. Gaucher disease (N=6), cystinosis (N=5), Pompe disease (N=3), and Fabry disease (N=2) had multiple approvals, CLN2, LAL-D, MPS I, II, IVA, VI, and VII one approval each. This is an increase of nine more approved drugs and four more treatable LSD's (CLN2, MPS VII, LAL-D, and MPS IVA) since 2013. Mean time between orphan drug designation and FDA approval was 89.7 SD 55.00 (range 8-203, N=23) months.
Conclusions: The development pipeline is growing and evolving into diversified small molecules and gene therapy. CLN2 was the first and only LSD with an approved therapy directly targeted to the brain. Newly approved products included ""me-too"" - enzymes and innovative compounds such as the first pharmacological chaperone for the treatment of Fabry disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.05.20016568v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.05.20016568v2.full.pdf","2020-01-14","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Neuromagnetic speech discrimination responses are associated with reading-related skills in dyslexic and typical readers","Dyslexia is thought to result from poor phonological processing. We investigated neuromagnetic speech discrimination in dyslexic and typical readers with mismatch fields (MMF) and determined the associations between MMFs and reading-related skills. We expected weak and atypically lateralized MMFs in dyslexic readers, and associations between reading-related skills and MMF strength. MMFs were recorded to a repeating pseudoword /ta-ta/ with occasional changes in vowel identity, duration, or syllable frequency from 43 adults, 21 with confirmed dyslexia. Speech-sound changes elicited MMFs in bilateral auditory cortices, with no group differences in source strengths. MMFs to vowel identity and duration changes were left-lateralized. Better verbal working memory was associated with stronger left-hemispheric MMFs across groups, suggesting the relevance of verbal working memory for speech processing. Better technical reading was associated with stronger right-hemispheric MMFs in dyslexic readers, suggesting a right-hemispheric compensatory mechanism for language processing. In conclusion, contrary to prior work, our results did not support deficient speech discrimination in dyslexia. However, in line with previous studies, we observed left-lateralized MMFs to vowel identity and duration changes, and associations of MMFs with reading-related skills, highlighting the connection between neural speech processing and reading and promoting the use of MMFs in investigating reading-related brain processes.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.29.19016113v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.29.19016113v2.full.pdf","2020-01-14","Neurology

"Common variants in Alzheimer's disease: Novel association of six genetic variants with AD and risk stratification by polygenic risk scores","BACKGROUND: Disentangling the genetic constellation underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important. Doing so allows us to identify biological pathways underlying AD, point towards novel drug targets and use the variants for individualised risk predictions in disease modifying or prevention trials. In the present work we report on the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AD risk to date and show the combined utility of proven AD loci for precision medicine using polygenic risk scores (PRS).
METHODS: Three sets of summary statistics were included in our meta-GWAS of AD: an Spanish case-control study (GR@ACE/DEGESCO study, n = 12,386), the case-control study of International Genomics of Alzheimer project (IGAP, n = 82,771) and the UK Biobank (UKB) AD-by-proxy case-control study (n=314,278). Using these resources, we performed a fixed-effects inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. Detected loci were confirmed in a replication study of 19,089 AD cases and 39,101 controls from 16 European-ancestry cohorts not previously used. We constructed a weighted PRS based on the 39 AD variants. PRS were generated by multiplying the genotype dosage of each risk allele for each variant by its respective weight, and then summing across all variants. We first validated it for AD in independent data (assessing effects of sub-threshold signal, diagnostic certainty, age at onset and sex) and tested its effect on risk (odds for disease) and age at onset in the GR@ACE/DEGESCO study.
FINDINGS: Using our meta-GWAS approach and follow-up analysis, we identified novel genome-wide significant associations of six genetic variants with AD risk (rs72835061-CHRNE, rs2154481-APP, rs876461-PRKD3/NDUFAF7, rs3935877-PLCG2 and two missense variants: rs34173062/rs34674752 in SHARPIN gene) and confirmed a stop codon mutation in the IL34 gene increasing the risk of AD (IL34-Tyr213Ter), and two other variants in PLCG2 and HS3ST1 regions. This brings the total number of genetic variants associated with AD to 39 (excluding APOE). The PRS based on these variants was associated with AD in an independent clinical AD-case control dataset (OR=1.30, per 1-SD increase in the PRS, 95%CI 1.18-1.44, p = 1.1x10-7), a similar effect to that in the GR@ACE/DEGESCO (OR=1.27, 95%CI 1.23-1.32, p = 7.4x10-39). We then explored the combined effects of these 39 variants in a PRS for AD risk and age-at-onset stratification in GR@ACE/DEGESCO. Excluding APOE, we observed a gradual risk increase over the 2% tiles; when comparing the extremes, those with the 2% highest risk had a 2.98-fold (95% CI 2.12-4.18, p = 3.2x10-10) increased risk compared to those with the 2% lowest risk (p = 5.9x10-10). Using the PRS we identified APOE e33 carriers with a similar risk as APOE e4 heterozygotes carriers, as well as APOE e4 heterozygote carriers with a similar risk as APOE e4 homozygote. Considering age at onset; there was a 9-year difference between median onset of AD the lowest risk group and the highest risk group (82 vs 73 years; p = 1.6x10-6); a 4-year median onset difference (81 vs 77 years; p = 6.9x10-5) within APOE e4 heterozygotes and a 5.5-year median onset difference (78.5 vs 73 years; p = 4.6x10-5) within APOE e4 carriers.
INTERPRETATION: We identified six novel genetic variants associated with AD-risk, among which one common APP variant. A PRS of all genetic loci reported to date could be a robust tool to predict the risk and age at onset of AD, beyond APOE alone. These properties make PRS instrumental in selecting individuals at risk in order to apply preventative strategies and might have potential use in diagnostic work-up.","/content/10.1101/19012021v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012021v2.full.pdf","2020-01-14","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Interactive web application for plotting personalized prognosis prediction curves in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using machine learning","Background:
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a curative treatment option for malignant hematological disorders. Transplant clinicians estimate patient-specific prognosis empirically in clinical practice based on previous studies on similar patients. However, this approach does not provide objective data. The present study primarily aimed to develop a tool capable of providing accurate personalized prognosis prediction after allo-HCT in an objective manner.
Methods:
We developed an interactive web application tool with a graphical user interface capable of plotting the personalized survival and cumulative incidence prediction curves after allo-HCT adjusted by eight patient-specific factors, which are known as prognostic predictors, and assessed their predictive performances. A random survival forest model using the data of patients who underwent allo-HCT at our institution was applied to develop this application.
Results:
We succeeded in showing the personalized prognosis prediction curves of 1-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) interactively using our web application (https://predicted-os-after-transplantation.shinyapps.io/RSF_model/). To assess its predictive performance, the entire cohort (363 cases) was split into a training cohort (70%) to develop the predictive model and test cohort (30%) to confirm its performance time-sequentially. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for 1-year OS, PFS, relapse/progression, and NRM in test cohort were 0.70, 0.72, 0.73, and 0.77, respectively.
Conclusions:
The new web application could allow transplant clinicians to inform a new allo-HCT candidate of the objective personalized prognosis prediction and facilitate decision-making.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014654v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014654v2.full.pdf","2020-01-14","Hematology

"Differences in Plasma Metabolites Related to Alzheimer's Disease, APOE-e4 Status and Ethnicity","Importance. Metabolomics can provide insight into molecular mechanisms within biochemical pathways leading to disease or in vivo changes that result from the disease. 
Objective. The goal of this investigation was to identify metabolites in plasma that capture systemic biochemical changes associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). 
Design. Plasma from individuals in a multi-ethnic, community-based cohort study underwent untargeted liquid chromatography (LC)-based ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-UHRMS) to test for hydrophilic and lipophilic chemicals derived from endogenous and exogenous sources. Each metabolite was tested for association with AD adjusting for age, sex and racial/ethnic group using the mixOmics package in R. Additional models were tested adjusting for the presence of APOE e4 alleles. Metabolites that differed between ethnic groups were also analyzed. An untargeted pathway analysis, using the network analysis software Mummichog, was conducted to identify pathways enriched in metabolites associated with AD. 
Setting. Multi-ethnic, community-based, case-control study.
Participants. Participants from the Washington Heights, Inwood, Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) of African American, Caribbean Hispanic and European ancestry provided blood samples from which plasma was extracted.  
Main Outcome.  Metabolomics profiles associated with AD.
Results. Over 9,700 features were measured, of which 5,929 were annotated by xMSannotator. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that AD clustered separately from healthy controls (AUC=0.9816); after adjusting for age, sex and ethnic group, discriminating pathways included glycerophospholipid, sphingolipid and non-essential amino acid (alanine, aspartate, glutamate) metabolism.   Metabolic features obtained in African Americans clustered differently than those in the Caribbean Hispanics and  non-Hispanic whites (AUC=0.9275), and there was a near complete separation between APOE e4 carriers and non-carriers irrespective of disease status (AUC=0.9972). 

Conclusions and Relevance. Metabolites, specifically lipids, were found to be associated with AD, APOE e4 and ethnic group.  Metabolite profiling in plasma could facilitate the identification of perturbed metabolic pathways in AD, but genetic and ancestral background need to be considered.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20016741v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20016741v1.full.pdf","2020-01-14","Neurology

"Mortality, disease progression, and disease burden of acute kidney injury in alcohol use disorder subpopulation","Objective: The objective of this study is to quantify the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), in terms of disease burden, mortality burden and disease progression. Methods: We used the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center in San Francisco, CA (UCSF) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) databases to quantify AKI disease and mortality burden as well as AKI disease progression in the AUD and non-AUD subpopulations. We used the MIMIC-III dataset to compare two different methods of encoding AKI: ICD-9 codes, and the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes scheme (KDIGO). In addition to the AUD subpopulation (defined by AUD-related ICD-9 codes), we also present analysis for the hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and alcohol-related cirrhosis subpopulations identified via ICD-9 coding. Results: In both the ICD-9 and KDIGO encodings of AKI, the AUD subpopulation had a higher prevalence of AKI (ICD-9: 48.59% vs. 29.99% AKI in the non-AUD subpopulations; KDIGO: 39.84% vs. 27.99%) in the MIMIC-III dataset. In the UCSF dataset, the AUD subpopulation also had a higher prevalence of AKI than the non-AUD subpopulation (ICD-9:  48.60% vs. 8.45%). The mortality rate of the subpopulation with both AKI and an AUD-related condition (AUD, HRS, or alcohol-related cirrhosis) was consistently higher than that of the subpopulation with only AKI in both datasets after adjusting for disease severity using two methods of severity estimation in the MIMIC-III dataset. Disease progression rates were similar for AUD and non-AUD subpopulations. Conclusions: Our work using the UCSF multi-ward academic hospital data and the MIMIC-III ICU dataset shows that the AUD patient subpopulation had a higher number of AKI patients than the non-AUD subpopulation, and that patients with both AKI and either AUD, HRS, or alcohol-related cirrhosis were shown to have higher rates of mortality than the non-AUD subpopulation with AKI.

"The Impact of Income Support Systems on Healthcare Quality and Functional Capacity in Workers with Low Back Pain: A Realist Review","Background:
Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of work disability. While absent from work, workers with LBP may receive income support from a system such as workers' compensation or social security. Current evidence suggests that income support systems can influence recovery from LBP, but provides little insight as to why and how these effects occur. This study examines how and in what contexts income support systems impact the healthcare quality for people with work disability and LBP and their functional capacity.

Methods:
We performed a realist review, a type of literature review that seeks to explain how social interventions and phenomena in certain contexts generate outcomes, rather than simply whether they do. Five initial theories about the relationship between income support systems and outcomes were developed, tested, and refined by acquiring and synthesising academic literature from purposive and iterative electronic database searching. This process was supplemented with grey literature searches for policy documents and legislative summaries, and semi-structured interviews with experts in income support, healthcare and LBP.

Results:
Income support systems influence healthcare quality through funding restrictions, healthcare provider administrative burden, and allowing employers to select providers. They also influence worker functional capacity through the level of participation and financial incentives for employers, measures to prove the validity of the worker's LBP, and certain administrative procedures. These mechanisms are often exclusively context-dependent, and generate differing and unintended outcomes depending on features of the healthcare and income support system, as well as other contextual factors such as socioeconomic status and labour force composition.

Discussion:
Income support systems impact the healthcare quality and functional capacity of people with work disability and LBP through context-dependent financial control, regulatory and administrative mechanisms. Research and policy design should consider how income support systems may indirectly influence workers with LBP via the workplace.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.20017343v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.20017343v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Ideal Cardiovascular Health in Urban Jamaica: Prevalence Estimates and Relationship to Community Property Value, Household Assets and Educational Attainment","BACKGROUND: Ideal cardiovascular health (ICH) is associated with greater longevity and reduced morbidity, but no research on ICH has been conducted in Jamaica. We estimated the prevalence of ICH in urban Jamaica and evaluated associations between ICH and community, household and individual socioeconomic status (SES).  
METHODS: Cross-sectional study using data from 360 men and 665 women, age =20 years   in urban Jamaica. ICH was defined as having seven characteristics: current non-smoking, healthy diet, moderate physical activity, and normal body mass index, blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol.  Logistic regression, weighted for survey design, quantified association between the outcome (=5 ICH characteristics [ICH-5]), and exposure variables (tertiles of community median land value [MLV], tertiles of household assets and educational attainment). 
RESULTS:  Prevalence of ICH (7 characteristics) was 0.51%, while prevalence of ICH-5 was 22.9% (male 24.5%, female 21.5%, p=0.447). In sex-specific multivariable models adjusted for age, education, and household assets, men in the lower tertiles of community MLV had lower odds of ICH-5 compared to men in the upper tertile (lowest tertile: OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.12-0.91, p=0.032; middle tertile:  OR 0.46 (0.20-1.04) p=0.062). Women from communities in the lower and middle tertiles of MLV also had lower odds of ICH-5, but association was not statistically significant. Educational attainment was inversely associated with ICH-5 among men and positively associated among women. No significant association was seen for household assets.
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of ICH is low in urban Jamaica. Living in poorer communities was associated with lower odds of ICH-5 among men. Higher education was associated with higher odds of ICH-5 among women but lowers odds among men.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.12.20017277v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.12.20017277v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Epidemiology

"Common genetic risk variants identified in the SPARK cohort implicate DDHD2 as a novel autism risk gene","Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder. Large genetically informative cohorts of individuals with ASD have led to the identification of three common genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci to date. However, many more common genetic variants are expected to contribute to ASD risk given the high heritability. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge (SPARK) dataset to identify additional common genetic risk factors and molecular mechanisms underlying risk for ASD. 
Methods: We performed an association study on 6,222 case-pseudocontrol pairs from SPARK and meta-analyzed with a previous GWAS. We integrated gene regulatory annotations to map non-coding risk variants to their regulated genes. Further, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to identify causal variant(s) within a novel risk locus.
Results: We identified one novel GWS locus from the SPARK GWAS. The meta-analysis identified four significant loci, including an additional novel locus. We observed significant enrichment of ASD heritability within regulatory regions of the developing cortex, indicating that disruption of gene regulation during neurodevelopment is critical for ASD risk. The MPRA identified one variant at the novel locus with strong impacts on gene regulation (rs7001340), and expression quantitative trait loci data demonstrated an association between the risk allele and decreased expression of DDHD2 (DDHD domain containing 2) in both adult and pre-natal brains. 
Conclusions: By integrating genetic association data with multi-omic gene regulatory annotations and experimental validation, we fine-mapped a causal risk variant and demonstrated that DDHD2 is a novel gene associated with ASD risk.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.20017319v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.20017319v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Comparison of a second-generation trabecular bypass (iStent inject) to ab interno trabeculectomy (Trabectome) by exact matching","Purpose: To achieve a highly balanced comparison of trabecular bypass stenting (IS2, iStent inject)with ab interno trabeculectomy (T, Trabectome) by exact matching. In a similar study, IS1 (1st generation iStent) had shown a loss of effect at 6 months. 
Methods: 53 IS2 eyes were matched to 3446 T eyes. Patients were matched using exact matching by baseline IOP, the number of glaucoma medications, and glaucoma type and using nearest neighbor matching by age. Individuals without a close match were excluded. All surgeries were combined with phacoemulsification.
Results: A total of 78 eyes (39 in each group) could be matched as exact pairs with a baseline IOP of 18.3+/-5.1 mmHg and glaucoma medications of 2.7+/-1.2 in each. IOP in IS2 was reduced to 14.6+/-4.2 mmHg at 3 months and in T to a minimum of 13.1+/-3.2 mmHg at 1 month. In IS2, IOP began to rise again at 6 months, eventually exceeding baseline. At 24 months, IOP in IS2 was 18.8+/-9.0 mmHg and in T 14.2+/-3.5 mmHg. IS2 had a higher average IOP than T at all postoperative visits (p<0.05 at 1, 12, 18 months). Glaucoma medications decreased to 2.0+/-1.5 in IS2 and to 1.5+/-1.4 in T.
Conclusion: T resulted in a larger and sustained IOP reduction compared to IS2 where a rebound occurred after six months to slightly above preoperative values. This time course fits the bioreactivity data of the IS1.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017582v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017582v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Ophthalmology

"Finding hotspots: development of an adaptive spatial sampling approach","The identification of disease hotspots is an increasingly important public health problem. While geospatial modeling offers an opportunity to predict the locations of hotspots using suitable environmental and climatological data, little attention has been paid to optimizing the design of surveys used to inform such models. Here we introduce an adaptive sampling scheme optimized to identify hotspot locations where prevalence exceeds a relevant threshold. Our approach incorporates ideas from Bayesian optimization theory to adaptively select sample batches. We present an experimental simulation study based on survey data of schistosomiasis and lymphatic filariasis across four countries. Results across all scenarios explored show that adaptive sampling produces superior results and suggest that similar performance to random sampling can be achieved with a fraction of the sample size.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20016964v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20016964v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Epidemiology

"A Genetics-First Approach to Dissecting the Heterogeneity of Autism: Phenotypic Comparison of Autism Risk Copy Number Variants","Objective: Certain copy number variants (CNVs) greatly increase risk of autism. We conducted a genetics-first study to investigate whether heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of autism is underpinned by specific genotype-phenotype relationships.
Methods: This international study included 566 children (12.3 years (SD=4.2), 51% male) who were ascertained on the basis of having a genetic diagnosis of a rare CNV associated with high risk of autism (83 16p11.2 deletion carriers, 50 16p11.2 duplication carriers, 380 22q11.2 deletion carriers and 53 22q11.2 duplication carriers), as well as 2027 children (9.1 years (SD=4.9), 87% male) with autism of heterogeneous aetiology. The Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and IQ testing were conducted. 
Results: The four genetic variant groups differed in autism severity, autism subdomain profile as well as IQ profile. However, we found substantial variability in phenotypic outcome within individual genetic variant groups (75% to 96% of the variance depending on the trait), whereas variability between groups was low (1% to 21% depending on trait). We compared CNV carriers who met autism criteria, to children with heterogeneous autism, and a range of profile differences were identified. Using clinical cut-offs, we found that 54% of children with one of the 4CNVs who did not meet full autism diagnostic criteria nonetheless had elevated levels of autistic traits.
Conclusion: Many CNV carriers do not meet full diagnostic criteria for autism, but nevertheless meet clinical cut-offs for autistic traits. Although we find profile differences between variants, there is considerable variability in clinical symptoms within the same variant.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.20017426v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.20017426v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Pleiotropic effects of statins on ischemic heart disease: a Mendelian Randomization study in the UK Biobank","Objectives: Statins appear to have pleiotropic effects. We examined whether specifically statins, of the major lipid modifiers, operate on ischemic heart disease (IHD) via testosterone. As a validation, we assessed whether a drug that unexpectedly likely increases IHD also operates via testosterone.
Design: A sex-specific univariate and multivariable Mendelian randomization study
Setting: A large, population-based cohort study recruited in the UK from 2006-10, the UK Biobank
Participants: 179918 men with 25410 IHD cases and 212080 women with 12511 IHD cases
Main Outcome measures: Testosterone and IHD
Results: Of the three lipid modulations considered, statins, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and ezetimibe, only genetically predicted statin use in men affected testosterone (-0.26 effect size testosterone per effect size (of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to -0.13). The genetically predicted effect of statin use on IHD in men was partially mediated by testosterone (odds ratio (OR) 0.54 per effect size (of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.79, compared to OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.02 after allowing for testosterone). The genetically predicted effect of anakinra use also affected testosterone (0.04 per effect size (of IL-1Ra), 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06), and increased IHD in men.
Conclusions: Statins may partially operate via testosterone in men, which may contribute to pleiotropic effects. Anakinra operating testosterone may also explain its unexpected effects. Our findings could facilitate the development of new interventions for cardiovascular diseases as well as highlighting the importance of sex-specific investigations.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.20017400v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.20017400v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Prognostic Imaging Biomarkers for Diabetic Kidney Disease (iBEAt): Study protocol","Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is traditionally classified based on albuminuria and reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)), but these have limitations as prognostic biomarkers due to the heterogeneity of DKD. Novel prognostic markers are needed to improve stratification of patients based on risk of disease progression.  
The iBEAT study, part of the BEAt-DKD consortium, aims to determine whether renal imaging biomarkers (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US)) provide insight into the pathogenesis and heterogeneity of DKD (primary aim), and whether they have potential as prognostic biomarkers in DKD progression (secondary aim). 
iBEAT is a prospective multi-centre observational cohort study recruiting 500 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and eGFR > 30ml/min/1.73m2. At baseline each participant will undergo quantitative renal MRI and US imaging with central processing for MRI images. Blood sampling, urine collection and clinical examinations will be performed and medical history obtained at baseline, and these assessments will be repeated annually for 3 years. Biological samples will be stored in a central laboratory for later biomarker and validation studies. All data will be stored in a central data depository. Data analysis will explore the potential associations between imaging biomarkers and renal function, and whether the imaging biomarkers may improve the prediction of DKD progression rates. 
Embedded within iBEAT are ancillary substudies that will (1) validate imaging biomarkers against renal histopathology; (2) validate MRI based renal blood flow against water-labelled positron-emission tomography (PET); (3) develop machine-learning methods for automated processing of renal MRI images; (4) examine longitudinal changes in imaging biomarkers; (5) examine whether the glycocalyx, microvascular function and structure are associated with imaging biomarkers and eGFR decline; (6) a pilot study to examine whether the findings in T2D can be extrapolated to type 1 diabetes.
The iBEAT study, the largest DKD imaging study to date, will provide invaluable insights into the progression and heterogeneity of DKD, and aims to contribute to a more personalized approach to the management of DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.20017228v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.20017228v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Sex differences in cardiometabolic traits at four life stages: cohort study with repeated metabolomics","Background: Males experience higher rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) than females, but the circulating traits underpinning this difference are poorly understood. We examined sex differences in detailed cardiometabolic traits measured at four life stages, spanning childhood to middle adulthood.
 
Methods and Results: Data were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort study. 229 traits quantified from targeted metabolomics (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) including lipoprotein subclass-specific cholesterol and triglycerides, amino acids, glucose, and inflammatory glycoprotein acetyls were measured repeatedly in offspring (Generation 1 (G1)) born in 1991-92 and once in their parents (Generation 0 (G0)). Measurements in G1 were once in childhood (mean age 8y), twice in adolescence (16y and 18y) and once in early adulthood (25y), and in G0 once in middle adulthood (50y). Linear regression models were used to examine differences in standardized traits for males compared with females on each occasion (serial cross-sectional associations). 7,727 G1s (49% male) and 6,500 G0s (29% male) contributed to analyses. At age 8y, total lipids in very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) were lower in males than females; levels were higher in males than females at age 16y and were higher still by age 18y and age 50y (in G0) for medium-or-larger subclasses. Larger sex differences at older ages were most pronounced for triglycerides in VLDL - e.g. male levels were 0.19 standard deviation (SD) units (95% CI=0.12, 0.26) higher at age 18y, 0.50 SD (95% CI=0.42, 0.57) higher at age 25y, and 0.62 SD (95% CI=0.55, 0.68) higher at age 50y. Cholesterol in VLDL and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) was generally lower in males, with inconsistent sex differences across ages. Apolipoprotein-B was generally lower in males than females. Branched chain amino acids were consistently higher in males after age 8y with the largest sex difference of all traits at all ages seen for leucine at age 50y (1.53 SD, 95% CI=1.47, 1.58 higher in males compared with females). Males had consistently lower glycoprotein acetyls across ages. 

Conclusions: Our results suggest that males begin to have higher VLDL triglycerides in adolescence, and that this sex difference is larger at older ages. Sex differences in other CHD-related traits, including LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein-B, and inflammatory glycoproteins, show the opposite pattern with age, with higher levels among females. Higher triglyceride content may therefore be a key factor underpinning the higher age-adjusted rate of CHD among males; causal analyses of this and other traits are needed to understand whether they differentially affect CHD risk among males and females.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.19015206v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.19015206v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Epidemiology

"Diagnosis in children with exercise-induced respiratory symptoms: a multi-centre study","Objective: Exercise-induced respiratory symptoms (EIS) are common in childhood and reflect different diseases that can be difficult to diagnose. In children referred to respiratory outpatient clinics for EIS, we compared the diagnosis proposed by the referring primary care physician with the final diagnosis from the outpatient clinic and described diagnostic tests performed and treatment prescribed after the diagnostic evaluation.
Design: Observational study nested in the Swiss Paediatric Airway Cohort (SPAC), which includes respiratory outpatients aged 0-16 years. 
Patients: We included children with EIS as main reason for referral. Information about diagnostic investigations, final diagnosis, and treatment prescribed came from outpatient records.
Results: 214 were referred for EIS (mean age 12 years, 99 (46%) female). The final diagnosis was asthma in 115 (54%), extrathoracic dysfunctional breathing (DB) in 35 (16%), thoracic DB in 22 (10%), asthma plus DB in 23 (11%), insufficient fitness in 10 (5%), chronic cough in 6 (3%), and other diagnoses in 3 (1%). Final diagnosis differed from referral diagnosis in 115 (54%). Spirometry, body plethysmography and measurements of exhaled nitric oxide were performed in almost all; exercise-challenge tests in a third. 91% of the children with a final diagnosis of asthma were prescribed inhaled medication and 50% of children with DB were referred to physiotherapy. 
Conclusions: Diagnosis given at the outpatient clinic often differed from the diagnosis suspected by the referring physician. Diagnostic evaluation, management and follow-up were inconsistent between clinics and diagnostic groups, highlighting the need for diagnostic guidelines in children seen for EIS.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20016956v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20016956v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Respiratory Medicine

"Cerebrospinal fluid p-tau217 performs better than p-tau181 as a biomarker of Alzheimerr's disease","Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau181 (tau phosphorylated at threonine 181) is an established biomarker of Alzheimerr's disease (AD) reflecting abnormal tau metabolism in the brain. Tau can be phosphorylated at multiple other sites including threonine 217, and here we investigated the performance of CSF p-tau217 as a biomarker of AD in comparison to p-tau181. In the Swedish BioFINDER cohort (n=194), p-tau217 had stronger correlations with the tau PET tracer [18F]flortaucipir, and more accurately identified individuals with abnormally increased [18F]flortaucipir retention. Furthermore, longitudinal increases in p-tau217 were higher compared to p-tau181 and better correlated with [18F]flortaucipir retention. P-tau217 correlated better than p-tau181 with PET measures of neocortical amyloid- burden and more accurately distinguished AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. Higher correlations between p-tau217 and [18F]flortaucipir were corroborated in an independent EXPEDITION3 trial cohort (n=32).

"Protocol for Project Recovery: Cardiac Surgery - Leveraging Digital Platform for Efficient Collection of Longitudinal Patient-Reported Outcome Data Towards Improving Postoperative Recovery","Introduction
Improving postoperative patient recovery after cardiac surgery is a priority, but our current understanding of individual variations in recovery and factors associated with poor recovery is limited. We are using a health-information exchange platform to collect patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and wearable device data to phenotype recovery patterns in the 30-day period after cardiac surgery hospital discharge, to identify factors associated with these phenotypes and to investigate phenotype associations with clinical outcomes. 

Methods and analysis
We designed a prospective cohort study to enroll 200 patients undergoing valve, coronary artery bypass graft, or aortic surgery at a tertiary center in the U.S. We are enrolling patients postoperatively after the intensive care unit (ICU) discharge, and delivering electronic surveys directly to patients every 3 days for 30 days after hospital discharge. We will conduct medical record reviews to collect patient demographics, comorbidity, operative details and hospital course using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) data definitions. We will use phone interview and medical record review data for adjudication of survival, readmission, and complications. We will apply group-based trajectory modeling to the time-series PROM and device data to classify patients into distinct categories of recovery trajectories. We will evaluate whether certain recovery pattern predicts death or hospital readmissions, as well as whether clinical factors predict a patient having poor recovery trajectories. We will evaluate whether early recovery patterns predict the overall trajectory at the patient-level.

"Colonoscopy and reduction of colorectal cancer risk by molecular tumor subtypes: a population-based case-control study","Objective: In previous studies, the protective effect of colonoscopy was generally stronger for distal than for proximal colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to investigate whether the association of colonoscopy and CRC risk varies according to major molecular pathological features and pathways of CRC.

Design: Population-based case-control study from Germany, including 2132 patients with a first diagnosis of CRC and information on major molecular tumor markers, and 2486 control participants without CRC. Detailed participant characteristics were collected by standardized questionnaires and information on previous colonoscopy was derived from medical records. Polytomous logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between previous colonoscopy and subtypes of CRC.

Results: Overall, we observed strong risk reduction of CRC after colonoscopy that was weaker for microsatellite instable (MSI) than for non-MSI CRC (p for heterogeneity <0.01), for CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) high CRC than for CIMP low/negative CRC (p het<0.01), for BRAF-mutated than for BRAF non-mutated CRC (p het=0.01), for KRAS non-mutated than for KRAS-mutated CRC (p het=0.04), and for CRC classified into the sessile serrated pathway than for CRC of the traditional pathway (p het<0.01). After colonoscopy with detection of adenomas, no risk reduction was found for sessile serrated pathway CRC. 

Conclusion: Our study extends the molecular understanding of existing differences in risk reduction of proximal and distal CRC reported by previous studies, and may imply important information for improving strategies for timely detection of relevant precursors.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017137v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017137v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Gastroenterology

"Immune-checkpoint engagement as predictive biomarkers in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and melanoma","Many cancers are termed immuno-evasive due to expression of immuno-modulatory ligands. Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and cluster of differentiation 80/86 (CD80/86) interact with their receptors, programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), on tumour infiltrating leukocytes, thus eliciting immunosuppression. Immunotherapies aimed at blocking these interactions are revolutionising cancer treatments, albeit in an inadequately described patient subset. Our prognostic assay, utilising amplified two-site time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer (iFRET), quantifies PD-1/ PD-L1 and CTLA-4/ CD80 iFRET efficiencies demonstrate, in cell-cell engagement models, that receptor-ligand interactions are significantly lower with anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 blocking antibodies. In patient samples, iFRET detects immune-cell/tumour-cell interaction variance in different cancers. These results revealed inter-cancer, inter-patient and intra-tumoural heterogeneity of engaged immune-checkpoints, contradicting their ligand expression patterns. Exploiting spatio-temporal interactions of immune-checkpoint proteins defined biomarker functionality for determining whether checkpoint inhibitors are appropriate treatments.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017517v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017517v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Oncology

"The potential cost-effectiveness of controlling dengue in Indonesia using wMel Wolbachia released at scale: a modelling study","Background
Release of virus-blocking Wolbachia infected mosquitoes is an emerging disease control strategy that aims to control dengue and other arboviral infections. Early entomological data and modelling analyses have suggested promising outcomes and wMel Wolbachia releases are now ongoing or planned in 12 countries. To help inform potential scale-up beyond single city releases, we assessed this technologys cost-effectiveness under different programmatic options.

Methods
Using costing data from existing Wolbachia releases, previous estimates of Wolbachia effectiveness, and a spatially-explicit model of release and surveillance requirements, we predicted the costs and effectiveness of the on-going programme in Yogyakarta City and three new hypothetical programmes in Yogyakarta Special Autonomous Region, Jakarta and Bali.

Results
We predicted Wolbachia to be a highly cost-effective intervention when deployed in high density urban areas with gross cost-effectiveness ratios below $1,500 per DALY averted. When offsets from the health system and societal perspective were included, such programmes even became cost saving over 10-year time horizons with favourable benefit-cost ratios of 1.35 to 3.40. Sequencing Wolbachia releases over ten years could reduce programme costs by approximately 38% compared to simultaneous releases everywhere, but also delays the benefits. Even if unexpected challenges occured during deployment, such as emergence of resistance in the medium-term or low effective coverage, Wolbachia would remain a cost saving intervention. 

Conclusions
Wolbachia releases in high density urban areas is expected to be highly cost-effective and could potentially be the first cost saving intervention for dengue.  Sites with strong public health infrastructure, fiscal capacity, and community support should be prioritized.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.11.20017186v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.11.20017186v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Health Economics

"tDCS to the left DLPFC improves cognitive control but not action cancellation in patients with ADHD: a behavioral and electrophysiological study","ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality that affects 5% of children, adolescents and adults worldwide. Pharmacological and behavioral therapies exist, but critical symptoms such as dysexecutive deficits remain unaffected. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study we assess the cognitive and physiological effects of tDCS in adult ADHD patients in order to understand (1) the role of DLPFC laterality in ADHD dysexecutive deficits, (2) the physiological dynamics sustaining the modulation of executive function by tDCS, and (3) the impact of state-dependent dynamics of tDCS effect. The participants consisted of a random sample of 40 adult patients with a primary diagnosis of ADHD. Each patient performed three experimental sessions in which they received 30 minutes of 2mA tDCS stimulation targeting the left DLPFC (anodal F3, cathodal Fp2), the right DLPFC (anodal F4, cathodal Fp1) and Sham. Before and after each session, half of the patients completed the Flanker task (EFT) and the other half performed the Stop Signal Task (SST), while we assessed cognitive (reaction time, accuracy) and neurophysiological measures (EEG Event-Related-Potentials). Results show that anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC modulated cognitive (reaction time) and physiological measures (P300 amplitude) in the Flanker task in a state-dependent manner, but there were no significant effects in the Stop Signal Reaction Time of the SST. We interpret these results as an improvement in interference cognitive control (captured by the EFT) but not in action cancellation (assessed by the SST), supporting the hypothesis of the existence of different impulsivity constructs with overlapping but distinct anatomical substrates and therapeutic strategies. We conclude that anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC using a simple bipolar montage has pro-cognitive effects in dysexecutive patients with ADHD associated with the modulation of physiological signatures of cognitive control (i.e. treatment target), supporting specific hypotheses and strategies for neuromodulation treatment development under an experimental therapeutics framework aiming to link target engagement (cognitive and physiological) with clinical benefit. In addition, we also provide empirical evidence supporting the value of the P200, N200 and P300 as cross-sectional biomarkers of cognitive performance across tasks. Last, we provide mechanistic support for the state-dependent nature of the effects of tDCS, highlighting the importance of controlling the neural states before and during stimulation as a relevant therapeutic strategy.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.20017335v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.20017335v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Association Between Reduced Handgrip Strength and Commonly Prescribed Medications","Decreased handgrip-strength has become an increasingly important measure of overall health status and fitness. This was a cross-sectional analysis among adult participants in the 2011-2012 NHANES survey. Handgrip-strength was assessed using a digital dynamometer and a standard protocol, and medication use was assessed by self-report and verification by the interviewer. Mean handgrip-strength among participants with no medication use was 87.2kg in males and 57.2kg in females. Handgrip strength decreased significantly in both men and women (ptrend<0.001 for both) with increasing medication use after adjustment for age, sex, height, arm circumference, and BMI. Statins, ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and sulfonylureas showed a consistent and significant decrease in grip strength in linear regression models. In this nationally representative survey of adults in the US, we observed a negative relationship between handgrip strength and polypharmacy. Further, several specific medications, mostly cardiovascular drug classes, were associated with reduced handgrip-strength.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017087v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017087v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Pharmacology and Therapeutics

"Effective connectivity of the hippocampus can differentiate patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls: a spectral DCM approach","We applied spectral dynamic causal modelling (spDCM; Friston et al., 2014) to analyze the effective connectivity differences between the nodes of three resting state networks (i.e. Default mode network/DMN, Salience network/SAN and Dorsal attention network/DAN) in a dataset of 31 healthy controls (HC) and 25 patients with schizophrenia (SZ), all male. Patients showed increased connectivity from the left hippocampus (LHC) to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (DACC), right anterior insula (RAI), left frontal eye fields (LFEF) and the bilateral inferior parietal sulcus (LIPS & RIPS), as well as increased connectivity from the right hippocampus (RHC) to the bilateral anterior insula (LAI & RAI), right frontal eye fields (RFEF) and RIPS. Moreover, negative symptoms predicted the connectivity strengths from the LHC to the DACC, the left inferior parietal sulcus (LIPAR) and the RHC, while positive symptoms predicted the connectivity strengths from the LHC to the LIPAR and from the RHC to the LHC. These results reinforce the crucial role of hippocampus dysconnectivity in SZ pathology and its potential as a biomarker of disease severity.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.12.20017293v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.12.20017293v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Locus coeruleus pathology in progressive supranuclear palsy, and its relation to disease severity.","The locus coeruleus is the major source of noradrenaline to the brain and contributes to a wide range of physiological and cognitive functions including arousal, attention, autonomic control, and adaptive behaviour. Neurodegeneration and pathological aggregation of tau protein in the locus coeruleus are early features of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). This pathology is proposed to contribute to the clinical expression of disease, including the PSP Richardson's syndrome. We test the hypothesis that tau pathology and neuronal loss are associated with clinical heterogeneity and severity in PSP. We used immunohistochemistry in post mortem tissues from 31 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PSP (22 with Richardson's syndrome) and 6 control cases. We quantified the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau, the number of pigmented cells indicative of noradrenergic neurons, and the percentage of pigmented neurons with tau-positive inclusions. Ante mortem assessment of clinical severity using the PSP rating scale was available within 1.8 (0.9) years for 23 patients. We found an average 49 percent reduction of pigmented neurons in PSP patients relative to controls. The loss of pigmented neurons correlated with disease severity, even after adjusting for disease duration and the interval between clinical assessment and death. The degree of neuronal loss was associated with tau-positive inclusions, with an average of 44% of pigmented neurons displaying tau-inclusions. Degeneration and tau pathology in the locus coeruleus are related to clinical heterogeneity of PSP. The noradrenergic deficit in the locus coeruleus is a candidate target for pharmacological treatment. Recent developments in ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging to quantify in vivo structural integrity of the locus coeruleus may provide biomarkers for noradrenergic experimental medicines studies in PSP.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.20016360v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.20016360v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Neurology

"Prospective Single Center Cohort Study for Early Diagnosis of Cardiac Dysfunction in Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivors: A Study Protocol","Introduction: Cardiovascular disease is the leading nonmalignant cause of late deaths in childhood cancer survivors. Cardiovascular disease and cardiac dysfunction can remain asymptomatic for many years, but eventually lead to progressive disease with high morbidity and mortality. Early detection and intervention are therefore crucial to improve outcome. In our study, we aim to 1) assess the prevalence of early cardiac dysfunction in adult childhood cancer survivors using conventional and speckle tracking echocardiography, 2) determine the association between cardiac dysfunction and treatment-related risk factors (anthracyclines, alkylating agents, steroids, cardiac radiation) and modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (abdominal obesity, hypertension), 3) investigate the development of cardiac dysfunction longitudinally in a defined cohort, 4) study the association between cardiac dysfunction and other health outcomes like pulmonary, endocrine, and renal diseases, quality of life, fatigue, strength and endurance, and physical activity, and 5) gain experience conducting a clinical study of childhood cancer survivors that will be extended to a national, multicenter study of cardiac complications.
Methods: We will invite =5 year childhood cancer survivors who were treated at the University Children's Hospital Bern, Switzerland with any chemotherapy and/or cardiac radiation since 1976 and who are =18 years of age at time of study for a cardiac assessment at the University Hospital Bern. This includes overall 544 childhood cancer survivors, of whom about half were treated with anthracyclines and/or cardiac radiation and half with any other chemotherapy. The standardized cardiac assessment includes a medical history focusing on signs of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, a physical examination, anthropometry, vital parameters, the 1-minute sit-to-stand test, and an echocardiography including speckle tracking. 
Results: We will invite 544 eligible childhood cancer survivors for a cardiac assessment with a median age at study of 32.5 years and a median times since diagnosis of 25.0 years. Three hundred survivors (55%) are at high risk and 244 survivors (45%) are at standard risk for cardiac dysfunction. 
Discussion: The results of this study will show the prevalence of early cardiac dysfunction in Swiss childhood cancer survivors, inform whether speckle tracking echocardiography is more sensitive to cardiac dysfunction than conventional echocardiography, and give a detailed picture of risk factors for cardiac dysfunction. The results will help improve primary treatment and follow-up care of children suffering from cancer.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017152v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017152v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Oncology

"The Changing Landscape: Geospatial, Epidemiologic Characteristics and Infectious Diseases of Inmates Living in a Region with a High Number of Prisons, Brazil","Objective: We determined the geospatial and epidemiologic characteristics and prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, syphilis, and co-infections in inmates in 28 prisons.
Design: This is a regional, observational, retrospective, and descriptive study conducted from November 2017 to October 2018.
Setting Prisons are located in the western and northwestern regions of Sao Paulo state, Brazil.
Methods: Data were obtained through a standard questionnaire from inmates with a diagnosis of infectious diseases and co-infections (HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, and tuberculosis), treatment, and time of incarceration. Locations of prisons and highways were obtained from shape file databases. Data on inhabitants, population growth, and Human Development Index were obtained from public agencies. Maps were constructed using geographic information system.
Results: A total of 37,497 individuals were enrolled in the study and 741 (1.97%) were diagnosed.  HIV was the most prevalent disease (0.68%), followed by tuberculosis (0.66%), syphilis (0.2%), HCV (0.2%), and HBV (0.04%). HIV-syphilis was the most prevalent co-infection (odds ratio, 63.7; 95% confidence interval: 41.4, 96.7). There was a statistical significance (P<0.001) for those with HIV acquiring co-infections. In 21 units, there was no relationship between the number of prisoners and the prevalence of infectious diseases.Mean age was 35.82 years (SD, 10.41 years) and 57.9% had been in prison previously. Strategically, most prisons were constructed beside radial highways. A higher than expected population growth was observed in 17 municipalities in which prisons were constructed (47.2%).
Conclusions: This is one of the biggest studies in Brazil, and the prevalence of infectious diseases among inmates was lower than countrywide. Therefore, improvements in health care are necessary, mainly in screening for infectious diseases. Construction of large prisons beside the radial highways changed the landscape and prevented migration of people from small to large cities.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20016998v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20016998v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Life course exposures continually shape antibody profile and risk of seroconversion to influenza","Complex exposure histories and immune mediated interactions between influenza strains contribute to the life course of human immunity to influenza. Antibody profiles can be generated by characterizing immune responses to multiple antigenically variant strains, but how these profiles vary across individuals and determine future responses is unclear. We used hemagglutination inhibition titers from 21 H3N2 strains to construct 777 paired antibody profiles from people aged 2 to 86, and developed novel metrics to capture features of these profiles. Total antibody titer per potential influenza exposure increases in early life, then decreases in middle age. Increased titers to one or more strains were seen in 97.8% of participants, suggesting widespread influenza exposure. While titer changes were seen to all strains, recently circulating strains exhibited the greatest variation. Higher pre-existing, homologous titers reduced the risk of seroconversion to recent strains. After adjusting for homologous titer, we also found an increased frequency of seroconversion among those with higher immunity to older previously exposed strains. Our results suggest that a comprehensive quantitative description of immunity encompassing past exposures could lead to improved correlates of risk of influenza.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.19015693v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.19015693v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"metPropagate: network-guided propagation of metabolomic information for prioritization of neurometabolic disease genes","Many inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are amenable to treatment, therefore early diagnosis before irreversible damage occurs is imperative. Despite recent advances, the genetic basis of many metabolic phenotypes remains unknown. For discovery purposes, Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) variant prioritization coupled with phenotype-guided clinical and bioinformatics expertise is currently the primary method used to identify novel disease-causing variants; however, it can be challenging to identify the causal candidate gene given the large number of plausible variants. Using untargeted metabolomics (UM) to prioritize metabolically relevant candidate genes is a promising approach to diagnosing known or novel IEMs in a single patient. Here, we present a network-based bioinformatics approach, metPropagate, that uses UM data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes. We validate metProp on 107 patients with diagnosed IEMs and 11 patients with novel IEMs diagnosed through the TIDE gene discovery project at BC Children's Hospital. The metPropagate method ranks candidate genes by considering the network of interactions between them. This is done by using a graph smoothing algorithm called label propagation to quantify the metabolic disruption in genes' local neighbourhood. metPropagate was able to prioritize the causative gene in the top 20th percentile of candidate genes for 91% of patients with known IEM disorders. For novel IEMs, metPropagate placed the causative gene in the top 20th percentile in 9/11 patients. Using metPropagate, the causative gene was ranked higher than Exomiser's phenotype-based ranking in 6/11 patients. The results of this study indicate that for diagnostic and gene discovery purposes, network-based analysis of metabolomics data can lend support to WES gene-discovery methods by providing an additional mode of evidence to help identify causal genes.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.12.20016691v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.12.20016691v1.full.pdf","2020-01-16","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Potential impact of outpatient stewardship interventions on antibiotic exposures of bacterial pathogens","The relationship between antibiotic stewardship and population levels of antibiotic resistance remains unclear. In order to better understand changes in selective pressure due to stewardship, we use publicly available data to estimate the effect of changes in prescribing on exposures to frequently used antibiotics experienced by potentially pathogenic bacteria that are asymptomatically colonizing the microbiome. We quantify this impact under four hypothetical stewardship strategies. In one scenario, we estimate that elimination of all unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use could avert 6 to 48% (IQR: 17 to 31%) of exposures across pairwise combinations of sixteen common antibiotics and nine bacterial pathogens. Across all scenarios, we find that successful stewardship interventions, facilitated by changes in clinician behavior and improved diagnostics, have the opportunity to substantially reduce exposures across a wide range of antibiotic-organism combinations. Concurrent approaches, such as vaccines aiming to reduce infection incidence, are needed to decrease exposures occurring in 'necessary' contexts.","/content/10.1101/19008029v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008029v2.full.pdf","2020-01-17","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Common variants in Alzheimer's disease: Novel association of six genetic variants with AD and risk stratification by polygenic risk scores","BACKGROUND: Disentangling the genetic constellation underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important. Doing so allows us to identify biological pathways underlying AD, point towards novel drug targets and use the variants for individualised risk predictions in disease modifying or prevention trials. In the present work we report on the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AD risk to date and show the combined utility of proven AD loci for precision medicine using polygenic risk scores (PRS).
METHODS: Three sets of summary statistics were included in our meta-GWAS of AD: an Spanish case-control study (GR@ACE/DEGESCO study, n = 12,386), the case-control study of International Genomics of Alzheimer project (IGAP, n = 82,771) and the UK Biobank (UKB) AD-by-proxy case-control study (n=314,278). Using these resources, we performed a fixed-effects inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. Detected loci were confirmed in a replication study of 19,089 AD cases and 39,101 controls from 16 European-ancestry cohorts not previously used. We constructed a weighted PRS based on the 39 AD variants. PRS were generated by multiplying the genotype dosage of each risk allele for each variant by its respective weight, and then summing across all variants. We first validated it for AD in independent data (assessing effects of sub-threshold signal, diagnostic certainty, age at onset and sex) and tested its effect on risk (odds for disease) and age at onset in the GR@ACE/DEGESCO study.
FINDINGS: Using our meta-GWAS approach and follow-up analysis, we identified novel genome-wide significant associations of six genetic variants with AD risk (rs72835061-CHRNE, rs2154481-APP, rs876461-PRKD3/NDUFAF7, rs3935877-PLCG2 and two missense variants: rs34173062/rs34674752 in SHARPIN gene) and confirmed a stop codon mutation in the IL34 gene increasing the risk of AD (IL34-Tyr213Ter), and two other variants in PLCG2 and HS3ST1 regions. This brings the total number of genetic variants associated with AD to 39 (excluding APOE). The PRS based on these variants was associated with AD in an independent clinical AD-case control dataset (OR=1.30, per 1-SD increase in the PRS, 95%CI 1.18-1.44, p = 1.1x10-7), a similar effect to that in the GR@ACE/DEGESCO (OR=1.27, 95%CI 1.23-1.32, p = 7.4x10-39). We then explored the combined effects of these 39 variants in a PRS for AD risk and age-at-onset stratification in GR@ACE/DEGESCO. Excluding APOE, we observed a gradual risk increase over the 2% tiles; when comparing the extremes, those with the 2% highest risk had a 2.98-fold (95% CI 2.12-4.18, p = 3.2x10-10) increased risk compared to those with the 2% lowest risk (p = 5.9x10-10). Using the PRS we identified APOE e33 carriers with a similar risk as APOE e4 heterozygotes carriers, as well as APOE e4 heterozygote carriers with a similar risk as APOE e4 homozygote. Considering age at onset; there was a 9-year difference between median onset of AD the lowest risk group and the highest risk group (82 vs 73 years; p = 1.6x10-6); a 4-year median onset difference (81 vs 77 years; p = 6.9x10-5) within APOE e4 heterozygotes and a 5.5-year median onset difference (78.5 vs 73 years; p = 4.6x10-5) within APOE e4 carriers.
INTERPRETATION: We identified six novel genetic variants associated with AD-risk, among which one common APP variant. A PRS of all genetic loci reported to date could be a robust tool to predict the risk and age at onset of AD, beyond APOE alone. These properties make PRS instrumental in selecting individuals at risk in order to apply preventative strategies and might have potential use in diagnostic work-up.","/content/10.1101/19012021v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012021v3.full.pdf","2020-01-17","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Association between inflammatory bowel disease and prostate cancer: A large-scale, prospective, population-based study","Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an established risk factor for colorectal cancer. Recent reports suggesting IBD is also a risk factor for prostate cancer (PC) require further investigation.
Objective: To test the association between IBD with incident PC. 
Design, setting, and participants: We studied 218,084 men in the population-based UK Biobank cohort, aged 40-69 at study entry between 2006 and 2010, with follow-up through mid-2015. 
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We assessed the association between IBD and subsequent PC using multivariable Cox regression analyses, adjusting for age at assessment, ethnic group, UK region, smoking status, alcohol drinking frequency, body mass index, Townsend Deprivation Index, family history of prostate cancer, and previous prostate-specific antigen testing.
Results and limitations: Mean age at study entry was 56 years, 94% of the men were white, and 1.1% (n=2,311) had a diagnosis of IBD. After a median follow-up of 78 months, men with IBD had an increased risk of PC (adjusted hazards ratio [aHR] = 1.31, 95% Confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-1.67, p = 0.029). Separately analyzing the IBD subtypes of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), the association with PC was only among men with the former (UC; aHR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.11-1.95, p=0.0070), and not the latter (CD; aHR 1.06, 95% CI = 0.63-1.80, p = 0.82). Results are limited by lack of data on frequency of health care interactions. 
Conclusions: In a large-scale, prospective cohort study, we detected an association between IBD, and UC specifically, with incident PC diagnosis.
Patient summary: This study of over 200,000 men in the UK suggests that men with inflammatory bowel disease may be at a higher risk of prostate cancer than the general population.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20017707v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20017707v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Epidemiology

"Personalised prediction of daily eczema severity scores using a mechanistic machine learning model","Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with periods of flares and remission. Designing personalised treatment strategies for AD is challenging, given the apparent unpredictability and large variation in AD symptoms and treatment responses within and across individuals. Better prediction of AD severity over time for individual patients could help to select optimum timing and type of treatment for improving disease control.
Objective: We aimed to develop a mechanistic machine learning model that predicts the patient-specific evolution of AD severity scores on a daily basis.

Methods: We designed a probabilistic predictive model and trained it using Bayesian inference with the longitudinal data from two published clinical studies. The data consisted of daily recordings of AD severity scores and treatments used by 59 and 334 AD children over 6 months and 16 weeks, respectively. Internal and external validation of the predictive model was conducted in a forward-chaining setting.

Results: Our model was able to predict future severity scores at the individual level and improved chance-level forecast by 60%. Heterogeneous patterns in severity trajectories were captured with patient-specific parameters such as the short-term persistence of AD severity and responsiveness to topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors and step-up treatment.

Conclusion: Our proof of principle model successfully predicted the daily evolution of AD severity scores at an individual level, and could inform the design of personalised treatment strategies that can be tested in future studies. Our model-based approach can be applied to other diseases such as asthma with apparent unpredictability and large variation in symptoms and treatment responses.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20017772v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20017772v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Allergy and Immunology

"Assessing Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices towards Causal Directed Acyclic Graphs among Epidemiologists and Medical Researchers: a qualitative research project","Background: Estimating the strength of causal effects is an important component of epidemiologic research, and causal graphs provide a key tool for optimizing the validity of these effect estimates. Although a large literature exists on the mathematical theory underlying the use of causal graphs, including directed acyclic graphs, to assess and describe causal assumptions, and translate these assumptions into appropriate statistical analysis plans, less literature exists to aid applied researchers in understanding how best to develop and use causal graphs in their research projects. 
Objective We sought to understand this gap by surveying practicing epidemiologists and medical researchers on their knowledge, level of interest, attitudes, and practices towards the use of causal graphs in applied epidemiology and health research. 
Methods We conducted an anonymous survey of self-identified epidemiology and health researchers via Twitter and via the Society of Epidemiologic Research membership listserv. The survey was conducted using Qualtrics and asked a series of multiple choice and open-ended questions about causal graphs. 
Results In total, 439 responses were collected. Overall, 62% reported being comfortable with using causal graphs, and 60% reported using them 'sometimes', 'often', or 'always' in their research. About 70% of respondents had received formal training on causal graphs (typically causal directed acyclic graphs). Having received any training appeared to improve comprehension of the underlying assumptions of causal graphs. Forty percent of respondents who did not use causal graphs reported lack of knowledge as a barrier. Of the participants who did not use DAGs, 39% expressed that trainings, either in-person or online, would be useful resources to help them use causal graphs more often in their research. 
Conclusion Causal graphs are of interest to epidemiologists and medical researchers, but there are several barriers to their uptake. Additional training and clearer guidance are needed. In addition, methodological developments regarding visualization of effect measure modification and interaction on causal graphs is needed.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20017939v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20017939v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Epidemiology

"E-Cigarette Use and Subclinical Cardiac Effects","BACKGROUND. Electronic (e-) cigarettes are marketed as a safer alternative to conventional tobacco cigarettes. Although e-cigarettes contain a lower level of nicotine, the delivery method involves delivering an aerosolized bolus of poorly-characterized ultrafine particles that have unknown cardiovascular effects. 

METHODS. We studied apparently adult volunteers, free of any chronic disease, including: non-smoking controls, chronic e-cigarette users, and chronic tobacco cigarette smokers. After overnight abstinence, we used myocardial contrast echocardiography to measure acute increases in myocardial blood flow (MBF)induced by ischemic rhythmic handgrip stress, which causes sympathetically-mediated increases in myocardial work and oxygen demand and, in turn, shear stress, nitric oxide production, and coronary endothelial-dependent vasodilation.
RESULTS. In non-smoking controls, handgrip stress increased myocardial blood flow, reflecting normal endothelial function. Chronic tobacco cigarette smokers demonstrated stress-induced blunting in myocardial blood flow change, when compared to non-smoking controls. Chronic e-cigarette smokers demonstrated a decrease, rather than increase, in myocardial blood flow change.

CONCLUSION. Chronic e-cigarette users demonstrated substantially impaired coronary microvascular endothelial function, even more pronounced than that seen in chronic tobacco cigarette users. These findings suggest that chronic e-cigarette use leads to measurable and persistent adverse vascular effects that are not directly related to nicotine.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20017780v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20017780v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Ethical Considerations When Creating Evidence from Real World Digital Health Data","Abstract
Background: Personal health data (PHD) are collected using digital self-tracking technologies and present opportunities to increase self-knowledge and, also biometric surveillance. PHD become big data and are used in health-related research studies. We surveyed consumers regarding expectations regarding consent and sharing of PHD for biomedical research.

Methods: Data sharing preferences were assessed via an 11-item survey. The survey link was emailed to 89539 English-speaking Withings product users. Responses were accepted for 5 weeks. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Excel and qualitative data were analyzed to provide additional context.

Results: Nearly 1640 people or 5.7% of invitees responded representing 62 countries with 80% identifying as Caucasian, 75% male with 78% being college educated. The majority were agreeable to having their data shared with researchers to advance knowledge and improve health care. Participants responding to open ended items (N=247) appeared unaware that the company had access to their personal health data. 

Conclusions: While the majority of respondents were in favor of data sharing, individuals expressed concerns about the ability to de-identify data and associated risks of re-identification as well as an interest in having some control over the use of their data. Given consumer misconception about data ownership, access and use, efforts to increase transparency when interacting with individual digital health data must be prioritized. Moreover, the basic ethical principle of respect for persons demonstrated via the informed consent process will be critical in advancing the adoption of digital technologies that create real-world evidence and advance opportunities for N-of-1 self-study.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20017806v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20017806v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Health Policy

"Retrospective evaluation of a filtering trabeculotomy in comparison to conventional trabeculectomy by exact matching","Purpose: To compare 2-year results of a filtering trabeculotomy (FTO) to conventional trabeculectomy (TE) in open-angle glaucoma by exact matching. 
Methods: 110 patients received an FTO and 86 a TE. FTO avoided the need for an iridectomy due to a preserved trabeculo-Descemet window anterior to the scleral flap. TE employed a trabecular block excision and iridectomy. Mitomycin C was used in both. FTO and TE were exact-matched by baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) and the number of glaucoma medications. Complete and qualified success (IOP =18 mmHg and IOP reduction = 30%, with or without medication) were primary endpoints. IOP, visual acuity (BCVA), complications and intervention were secondary endpoints. 
Results: 44 FTO were exact-matched to 44 TE. The IOP baseline in both groups was 22.5+/-4.7 mmHg on 3+/-0.9 medications. At 24 months, complete success was reached by 59% in FTO and 66% in TE and qualified success by 59% in FTO and 71% in TE. In FTO, IOP was reduced to 12.4+/-4.3 mmHg at 12 months and 13.1+/-4.1 mmHg at 24 months. In TE, IOP was 11.3+/-2.2 mmHg at 12 months and 12.0+/-3.5 mmHg at 24 months. Medications could be reduced at 24 months to 0.6+/-1.3 in FTO and 0.2+/-0.5 in TE. There were no significant differences between the two groups in IOP, medications, complications or interventions at any point. 
Conclusion: Modifying aqueous flow through a limited trabeculotomy in FTO yielded clinical outcomes similar to traditional TE but allowed to avoid an iridectomy.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20017913v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20017913v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Ophthalmology

"Risk prediction with office and ambulatory blood pressure using artificial intelligence","Background: To develop and validate a novel, machine learning-derived model for prediction of cardiovascular (CV) mortality risk using office (OBP) and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), to compare its performance with existing risk scores, and to assess the possibility of predicting ABP phenotypes (i.e. white-coat, ambulatory and masked hypertension) utilizing clinical variables.
Methods: Using data from 63,910 patients enrolled in the Spanish ABP monitoring registry, machine-learning approaches (logistic regression, support vector machine, gradient boosted decision trees, and deep neural networks) and stepwise forward feature selection were used for the classification of the data.
Results: Over a median follow-up of 4.7 years, 3,808 deaths occurred from which 1,295 were from CV causes. The performance for all tested classifiers increased while adding up to 10 features and converged thereafter. For the prediction of CV mortality, deep neural networks yielded the highest clinical performance. The novel mortality prediction models using OBP (CV-MortalityOBP) and ABP (CV-MortalityABP) outperformed all other risk scores. The area under the curve (AUC) achieved by the novel approach, using OBP variables only, was already significantly higher when compared with the AUC of Framingham score (0.685 vs 0.659, p = 1.9710-22), the SCORE (0.679 vs 0.613, p = 6.2110-22), and ASCVD (0.722 vs 0.639, p = 8.0310-30) risk score. However, prediction of CV mortality with ABP instead of OBP data led to a significant increase in AUC (0.781 vs 0.752, p = 1.7310-42), accuracy, balanced accuracy and sensitivity. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of ambulatory, masked, and white-coat hypertension ranged between 0.653-0.661 and 0.573-0.651, respectively. 
Conclusion: We developed a novel risk calculator for CV death using artificial intelligence based on a large cohort of patients included in the Spanish ABP monitoring registry. The receiver operating characteristic curves for CV-MortalityOBP and CV-MortalityABP with deep neural networks models outperformed all other risk metrics. Prediction of CV mortality using ABP data led to a significant increase in performance metrics. The prediction of ambulatory phenotypes using clinical characteristics, including OBP, was limited.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20017798v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20017798v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Most of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa co-infecting isolates coexist, a condition that may impact clinical outcomes in Cystic Fibrosis patients.","Staphylococcus aureus(SA) is the major colonizer of the lung of cystic fibrosis (CF) patient during childhood and adolescence. As patient aged, the prevalence of SA decreases and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) becomes the major pathogen infecting adult lungs. Nonetheless, SA remains significant and patients harbouring both SA and PA are frequently found in worldwide cohort. Impact of coinfection remains controversial. Furthermore, co-infecting isolates may compete or coexist. The aim of this study was to analyse if co-infection and coexistence of SA and PA could lead to worse clinical outcomes. The clinical and bacteriological data of 212 Lyon CF patients were collected retrospectively, and patients were ranked into three groups, SA only (n=112), PA only (n=48) or SA plus PA (n=52). In addition, SA and PA isolates from co-infecting patients were tested in vitro to define their interaction profile. Sixty five percent (n=34) of SA/PA pairs coexist. Using univariate and multivariate analysis, we confirm that SA patients have a clinical condition less severe than others, and PA induce a poor outcome independently of the presence of SA. FEV1 is lower in patients infected by competition strain pairs than in those infected by coexisting strain pairs compared to SA mono-infection. Coexistence between SA and PA may be an important step in the natural history of lung bacterial colonization within CF patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20017863v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20017863v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Validity of intraoperative imageless navigation (Naviswiss) for component positioning accuracy in primary total hip arthroplasty: Protocol for a prospective observational cohort study in a single-surgeon practice","Introduction:
Optimal outcomes in total hip arthroplasty are dependent on appropriate placement of femoral and acetabular components, with technological advances providing a platform for guiding component placement to reduce the risk of malpositioned components during surgery. This study will validate the intraoperative data captured using a handheld imageless THA navigation system against postoperative measurements of acetabular inclination, anteversion, leg length, and femoral offset on CT radiographs. 

Methods and analysis:
This is a prospective observational cohort study conducted within a single-centre, single-surgeon private practice. Data will be collected for 35 consecutive patients (>18years) undergoing elective THA surgery, from the research registry established at the surgeon's practice. The primary outcome is the agreement between intraoperative component positioning data captured by the navigation system compared to postoperative measurements using computed tomography (CT).  A total of ten CT scans will be re-assessed for inter- and intra-observer reliability. The influence of patient and surgical factors on the accuracy of component position will also be examined with multivariable linear regression.  

Ethics and disseminatio:
Ethics approval for this study was provided through a certified ethics committee (Bellberry HREC approval number 2017-07-499). The results of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017756v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017756v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Orthopedics

"Higher polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia may be suggestive of treatment non-response in major depressive disorder","Background. Up to 60% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not respond to the first treatment with antidepressants. Response to antidepressants is a polygenic trait, although its underpinning genetics has not been fully clarified. This study aimed to investigate if Polygenic Risk Scores (PRSs) for major psychiatric disorders and neuroticism were associated with non-response or resistance to antidepressants in MDD.
Methods. PRSs for bipolar disorder, MDD, neuroticism, and schizophrenia (SCZ) were computed in 1148 MDD patients recruited by the European Group for the Study of Resistant Depression. Summary statistics from largest meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies were used as base data. Patients were classified as responders, non-responders to one treatment, non-responders to two or more treatments (treatment-resistant depression or TRD). Regression analyses were adjusted for population stratification and recruitment sites.
Results. PRSs did not predict either non-response or TRD after Bonferroni correction. However, SCZ-PRS was nominally associated with non-response (p=0.003). Patients in the highest SCZ-PRS quintile were more likely to be non-responders than those in the lowest quintile (OR=2.23, 95% CI=1.21-4.10, p=0.02). Patients in the lowest SCZ-PRS quintile showed higher response rates when they did not receive augmentation with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), while those in the highest SCZ-PRS quintile had a poor response independently from the treatment strategy (p=0.009).
Conclusions. A higher genetic liability to SCZ may reduce responsiveness to pharmacological treatment in MDD. From a clinical point of view, our results suggest that MDD patients with low SCZ-PRS do not benefit from augmentation with SGAs.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017699v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017699v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Complex multi-environment gene interactions linked to the interplay between polysubstance dependence and suicidal behaviors","Background and Aims: Substance dependence diagnoses (SDs) are important risk factors for suicidal behaviors. We investigated the associations of multiple SDs with different suicidal behaviors and tested how genetic background moderates these associations.

Design: Multivariate logistic regression to investigate the associations of SDs with suicidal behaviors; structured linear mixed model to study multivariate gene-environment interactions.

Setting: The Yale-Penn cohort was recruited to investigate the genetics of SDs. The Army STARRS (Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers) cohort was recruited to evaluate mental health risk and resilience for suicidal behaviors among Army personnel.

Participants: Yale-Penn participants (N=15,557) were assessed via the Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism. Army STARRS participants (N=11,236) were evaluated using the self-administered Composite International Diagnostic Interview Screening Scales.

Measurements: Lifetime self-reported suicidal behaviors (ideation, SI; planning; attempt, SA); Lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses and criteria for dependence on alcohol, cannabis, cocaine (CoD), opioid (OD), and nicotine (ND) (Yale-Penn); substance use disorder (SUD) (Army STARRS). 

Findings: In Yale-Penn, lifetime polysubstance dependence was strongly associated with lifetime suicidal behaviors: individuals with five SDs showed increased odds ranging from OR=6.77 (95%CI=5.74-7.99) for SI to OR=3.61 (95%CI=2.7-4.86) for SA. In Army STARRS, SUD was associated with increased odds ranging from OR=2.88 (95%CI=2.6-3.19) for SI to OR=3.92 (95%CI=3.19-4.81) for SA. In Yale-Penn, we identified multivariate gene-environment interactions (Bayes factors, BF > 0) of SI with respect to a gene cluster on chromosome 16 (LCAT, p=1.82x10-7; TSNAXIP1, p=2.13x10-7; CENPT, p=2.32x10-7; PARD6A, p=5.57x10-7) for OD (BF=12.2), CoD (BF=12.1), ND (BF=9.2), and polysubstance dependence (BF=2.1).

Conclusions: Comorbidity of multiple SDs is a significant suicide risk factor and heritability of suicidal behaviors is partially moderated by multivariate gene interactions.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.20017509v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.20017509v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"The Concurrent Initiation of Medications Is Associated with Discontinuation of Buprenorphine Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder","Introduction: Retention in buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) yields better opioid abstinence and reduces all-cause mortality for patients with OUD. Despite significant efforts have been made to expand the availability and use of buprenorphine in the United States, its retention rates remain on a low level. The current study examines discontinuation of buprenorphine with respect to concurrent initiation of other medications using real-world evidence. 
Methods: Case-crossover study was conducted to examine discontinuation of buprenorphine using a large-scale longitudinal health dataset including 148,306 commercially-insured individuals initiated on medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Odds ratios and Bonferroni adjusted p-values were calculated for medications and therapeutic classes of medications.
Results: Clonidine was associated with increased discontinuation risk of buprenorphine both using the buprenorphine dataset alone (OR = 1.583 and adjusted p-value < 0.05) and using naltrexone as a comparison drug (OR = 2.706 and adjusted p-value < 0.05). Opioid medications (oxycodone, morphine and fentanyl) and methocarbamol were associated with increased discontinuation risk of buprenorphine using the buprenorphine dataset alone (adjusted p-value < 0.05), but not significant using naltrexone as a comparison drug. 6 drug therapeutic classes were associated with increased discontinuation risk of buprenorphine both using the buprenorphine dataset alone and using naltrexone as a comparison drug (adjusted p-value < 0.05).
Conclusion: Concurrent initiation of medications is associated with increased discontinuation risk of buprenorphine. Opioid medications are prescribed among patients on MOUD and associated with increased discontinuation risk of buprenorphine. Analgesics is associated with increased discontinuation risk of buprenorphine for patients without previous exposure of pain medications.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017715v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017715v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Addiction Medicine

"Prognostic and Predictive Factors for Primary Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer","Background: Complete pathologic response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer is associated to a better locoregional disease control and better long-term prognosis. Our purpose is to identify clinical and pathologic characteristics that influence treatment response, relapse risk and overall survival.
Methods: We analyzed 341 women with breast cancer submitted to primary chemotherapy between 2004 and 2017. We compared clinical response, pathologic response and conservative surgery rate, among different tumor and patient features. We assessed survival and relapse rate, according to complete pathologic response and histologic characteristics.
Results: Among 341 women who underwent neoadjuvant treatment, 34% obtained pCR and 94,4% expressed a pathologic response.
Patients who achived pCR had better overall survival (HR 0,68, CI95% 0,53-0,87, p=0.002) and better progression free survival (HR 0,78, CI95%, 0,61-1,00, p=0,05). pCR was significantly influenced by histologic grade (0% G1, 18,9% G2 vs 41,5% G3, p-value <0,001), HER2 over-expression (56% vs 22,8%, p-value<0,001), cytokeratin 19 expression (38,6% vs 30,8%, p-value 0,047) and cytokeratin 5 (44% vs 32,4%, p-value 0,002).
Instead, presence of bilateral breast cancer (34,7% vs 0%, p-value 0,007) and hormone receptor expression (20,2% vs 54,3%, p-value <0,001) negatively influenced pCR. Additionally, overall survival was negatively influenced by cytokeratin 19 expression (HR 0,14, CI95% 0,10-0,20, p<0,001) and presence of inflammatory breast cancer (HR 0,26, CI95% 0,11-0,64, p=0.003).
Conclusion: Cytokeratin 19 expression, cytokeratin 5 expression, histologic grade, molecular subtypes and bilaterality are independent predictors for pCR to primary chemotherapy. pCR influences positively overall survival and progression free survival. However, inflammatory carcinoma and cytokeratin 19 expression are independent predictors for a worse prognosis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.20017467v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.20017467v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Oncology

We describe here our experience of treating MS-patients with B-cell depleting rituximab.
Patients and methods: All MS-patients (n=72) who had received rituximab treatment for at least six months by January 2019 were identified from the patient charts at the Turku University Hospital. Information about MS disease subtype, disease severity, MR-imaging outcomes and B-cell counts were collected from the charts. 
Results: Rituximab was well received and well tolerated by the patients. There were no serious infusion-related side effects. The most serious adverse event that led to treatment discontinuation was neutropenia. Our study confirms the usability of rituximab treatment for MS in the Finnish health care environment.

"Microstructural changes in the reward system are associated with post-stroke depression","Background:
Studies of lesion location have been unsuccessful in identifying simple mappings between single brain regions and post-stroke depression (PSD). This might partly reflect the involvement of multiple interconnected regions in the regulation of mood. In this study, we set out to investigate whole-brain network structure and white matter connectivity in the genesis of PSD. Based on studies implicating regions of the reward system in major depressive disorder without stroke, we investigated the overlap of whole-brain correlates of PSD with this system and performed a focused analysis of grey matter and white matter projections within the reward system and their associations with the development of PSD. 

Methods:
The study enrolled 46 patients with first ischemic stroke, 12 were found to have PSD (D+ group) and 34 were free of PSD (D-) based on scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale. A group of 16 healthy controls were also recruited. Participants underwent research MRI with 3T structural and diffusion sequences. Graph theoretical measures derived from measures of microstructure were used to examine global topology and whole-brain connectome analyses were employed to assess differences in the interregional connectivity matrix between the three groups. Structural correlates specific to the reward system were examined by measuring grey matter volumes from regions in this circuit and by reconstructing its main white matter pathways, namely the medial forebrain bundle and connections within the cingulum bundle with deterministic tractography. For network connections and tracts, we derived measures of microstructural organization (FA), and also extracellular free-water content (FW) as a possible proxy of neuroinflammation.

Results:
The topology of structural networks differed across the three groups. Network modularity, weighted by extracellular FW content, increased with depression severity and connectome analysis identified networks of decreased FA-weighted and increased FW-weighted connectivity in patients with PSD relative to healthy controls. Intrinsic frontal and fronto-subcortical connections were a notable feature of these networks, which also subsumed the majority of regions defined as constituting the reward system. Within the reward system, grey matter volume of cortical and subcortical regions, as well as FA and FW of major connection pathways, were collectively predictive of PSD severity, explaining 76.8% of the variance in depression severity. 

Conclusions:
Taken together, these findings indicate that PSD is associated with microstructural characteristics of the reward system, similar to those observed in major depressive disorder without stroke. Alterations in the reward system appear to drive differences in whole-brain network structure found in patients with PSD. Even in the absence of a simple relationship with lesion size and location, neuroimaging measures can explain much of the variance in depression scores. Structural characterization of the reward system is a promising biomarker of vulnerability to depression after stroke.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.20017384v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.20017384v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Network-based Translation of GWAS Findings to Pathobiology and Drug Repurposing for Alzheimer's Disease","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, utilizing GWAS to identify high-confidence AD risk genes (ARGs) that can guide development of new therapeutics for patients suffering from AD has heretofore not been successful. To address this critical problem in the field, we have developed a genotype-informed, network-based methodology that interrogates pathogenesis to identify new therapeutics. When applied to AD, this approach integrates GWAS findings, multi-omics data from brain samples of AD patients and preclinical AD models, drug-target networks, and the human protein-protein interactome, along with large-scale patient database validation and in vitro mechanistic observations in human microglia cells. Through this approach, we identified 103 ARGs validated by various levels of pathobiological evidence in AD. Via network-based prediction and population-based validation, we then showed that pioglitazone usage is significantly associated with decreased risk of AD (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.895, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.841-0.951, P = 3.97 x 10-4) in a retrospective case-control validation. Pioglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist used to treat type 2 diabetes, and propensity score matching cohort studies confirmed its association with reduced risk of AD in comparison to glipizide (HR =0.921, 95% CI 0.861-0.983, P = 0.0146), an insulin secretagogue that is also used to treat type 2 diabetes. In vitro experiments showed that pioglitazone downregulated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK5) in human microglia cells, supporting a possible mechanism-of-action for its beneficial effect in AD. In summary, we present an integrated, network-based methodology to rapidly translate GWAS findings and multi-omics data to genotype-informed therapeutic discovery in AD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017160v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017160v1.full.pdf","2020-01-18","Neurology

"Validation of Emotional Stimuli Flashcards for Conducting 'Response to Reward' fMRI study among Malaysian students","Problematic Instagram Use (PIGU) is a type of behavioural addiction (BA), and is one of the types of specific-Internet addiction disorders in Malaysia. Most studies have relied on questionnaire-based assessment e.g. Smartphone Addiction Scale-Malay version (SAS-M) and modified Instagram Addiction Test (IGAT), to establish commonalities between PIGU and other BA and substance use disorders (SUDs), albeit lacking in neurobiological evidence to support the hypothesis. Advantageously, fMRI neuroimaging technique can objectively assess regional brain activation in response to addiction-specific rewards. To date, there is no local database with addiction-specific cues pertaining to PIGU that can elicit robust brain activations and portray similar neurobiological mechanisms as shown in SUDs.  Objective: We aimed to conduct an out-of-scanner validation study to create a database of pictures using 'Risky' and 'Neutral' cues that can evoke emotional responses of cravings among PIGUs. Method: Forty-four Malaysian undergraduate students (20 PIGUs, 24 controls) were selected via simple random sampling and administered a set of 200 pictures to score their affective ratings. The ratings were based on valence, arousal, and approach-avoidance dimensions using a 9-point Likert scale. Results: PIGUs viewing 'Risky' cues demonstrated significant positive correlations between arousal & valence (z = 4.834, p < .001, effect size = 0.69) and arousal & avoidance-approach (z = 4.625, p < .001, effect size= 0.66) as compared to controls.

"Population-based stroke surveillance using Big Data: epidemiological trends in admissions and mortality in Australia.","Background: Epidemiological trends for major causes of death and disability, such as stroke, may be monitored using administrative data to guide public health initiatives and service delivery. 
Methods: We calculated admissions rates for ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage or subarachnoid haemorrhage between January 1, 2005 and December 31st, 2013 and rates of 30-day mortality and 365-day mortality in 30-day survivors to December 31st 2014 for patients aged 15 years or older from New South Wales, Australia (population 7.99 million). Annual Average Percentage Change in rates was estimated using negative binomial regression.
Results: Of 81,703 eligible admissions, 64,047 (78.4%) were ischaemic strokes and 13,302 (16.3%) and 4,778 (5.8%) were intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhages, respectively. Intracerebral haemorrhage admissions significantly declined by an average of 2.2% annually (95% Confidence Interval=-3.5% to -0.9%) (p<0.001). Thirty-day mortality rates significantly declined for ischaemic stroke (Average Percentage Change -2.9%, 95% Confidence Interval=-5.2% to -1.0%) (p=0.004) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (Average Percentage Change=-2.6%, 95% Confidence Interval=-4.8% to -0.2%) (p=0.04). Mortality at 365-days amongst 30-day survivors of ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage was stable over time and increased in 30-day survivors of subarachnoid haemorrhage (Annual Percentage Change 6.2%, 95% Confidence Interval=-0.1% to 12.8%), although the increase was not statistically significant (p=0.05).
Conclusion: Improved prevention may have underpinned declining intracerebral haemorrhage rates while gains in survival suggest that innovations in stroke care are being successfully translated. Longer-term mortality in patients surviving the acute period is unchanged and may be increasing for subarachnoid haemorrhage warranting investment in post-discharge care and secondary prevention.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.20016899v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.20016899v2.full.pdf","2020-01-20","Epidemiology

"Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder: symptomatic and syndromic thresholds and diagnostic operationalization","Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the most appropriate threshold for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) diagnosis and the impact of potential changes in diagnostic rules on prevalence levels in the community. 
Method: Trained psychologists evaluated 3,562 pre-adolescents/early adolescents from the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort with the Development and Well-Being Behavior Assessment (DAWBA). The clinical threshold was assessed in three stages: symptomatic, syndromic and clinical operationalization. The symptomatic threshold identified the response category in each DAWBA item which separates normative misbehavior from a clinical indicator. The syndromic threshold identified the number of irritable mood and outbursts needed to capture pre-adolescents/early adolescents with high symptom levels. Clinical operationalization compared the impact of AND/OR rules for combining irritable mood and outbursts on impairment and levels of psychopathology. 
Results: At the symptomatic threshold, most irritable mood items were normative in their lowest response categories and clinically significant in their highest response categories. For outbursts some indicated a symptom even when present at only a mild level, while others did not indicate symptoms at any level. At the syndromic level, a combination of 2 out of 7 irritable mood and 3 out of 8 outburst indicators accurately captured a cluster of individuals with high level of symptoms. Analysis combining irritable mood and outbursts delineated non-overlapping aspects of DMDD, providing support for the OR rule in clinical operationalization. The best DMDD criteria resulted in a prevalence of 3%. 
Conclusion: Results provide information for initiatives aiming to provide data-driven and clinically oriented operationalized criteria for DMDD.","/content/10.1101/19002436v4?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002436v4.full.pdf","2020-01-20","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Paracingulate sulcus length is shorter in voice-hearers regardless of need for care","While hallucinations are often considered to be the sine qua non of serious mental illness, they are commonly experienced by those without a need for care. Such non-clinical, hallucinating individuals offer a window into the etiology of hallucinations. Garrison et al. (2015) recently assessed structural variability in paracingulate sulcus (PCS) of medial prefrontal cortex. They found a reduction of 10mm in left hemisphere PCS length increased the likelihood of hallucinations by 19.9%. However, these findings were in clinical hallucinators, and reduced leftward asymmetry in PCS has been repeatedly demonstrated in schizophrenia and associated with reduced reality monitoring. Similar analyses have been conducted in non-clinical voice hearers and in those particpants, no reduction in PCS length was reported. However, there is considerable variability in the voice experiences of non-clinical voice hearers. Put simply, some may be more clinical than others. We recently identified a relatively homogenous group of non-clinical voice hearers who identify as clairaudient psychics. Their voice experiences are extremely redolent of those reported by a matched patient voice hearing group and their brain and behavioral responses to a perceptual inference task were, at least at the level of prior beliefs, similarly perturbed to patients who hear voices. These observations are consistent with a continuum model of voice hearing, along which clairaudient voice hearers are nearer to patients with schizophrenia in some respects. The PCS data reported by Garrison et al would militate against such a continuum. Before rejecting the continuum model, we sought to determine if the differences in PCS length also applied to the clairaudient non-clinical voice hearers. If PCS length is to be developed as a biomarker for clinical hallucination risk, then it is important to demonstrate that it is not similarly reduced in non-clinical voice hearers. We find that it is reduced, both in clinical and non-clinical voice-hearers.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.19015891v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.19015891v1.full.pdf","2020-01-20","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Silicone Induced Granuloma of Breast Implant Capsule (SIGBIC) diagnosis: Breast Magnetic Resonance (BMR) ability to detect silicone bleeding.","Objective: To evaluate the ability of BMRI to detect silicone gel bleeding in a prospective observational study including consecutive patients referred for BMRI scan.
Methods: From January 2017 to March 2018, patients referred for BMRI were evaluated in a prospective observational study. Patients who had breast implants were included. BMRI recorded 9 findings according to BI-RADS lexicon and SIGBIC findings, considered equivocal features to detect gel bleeding (GB). Three new original imaging features were added for SIGBIC diagnosis: black drop signal; T2* hypersignal mass; and delayed contrast enhancement, considered as irrevocable signs. The presence of silicone corpuscle was confirmed by percutaneous biopsy or surgical capsulectomy. Accuracy of BMRI SIGBIC findings to predict GB was determined. We also used univariate analysis for the equivocal features for GB diagnosis. The Backward method was applied for a multivariate Logistic Regression model for the equivocal features. 
Results: SIGBIC was diagnosed in 208 patients and GB was histologically confirmed in all cases. No false positive results were observed. The most important imaging equivocal feature associated with GB was capsular contracture. In order of prevalence, the main equivocal BMRI features associated to GB with statistically significance (P < =0.001) were as follows: 1.water droplets (OR=2.8; 95%CI 1.8-4.4);  2.enlarged intramammary lymph node (OR=3.1; 95%CI 1.5-6.1); 3.pericapsular edema (OR=5.0; 95%CI 2.3-11.1); and 4.intracapsular seroma (OR=2.4; 95%CI 1.4-4.1). 
Conclusion: SIGBIC diagnosis has high sensitivity to predict GB by the 3 irrevocable BMRI features described by the authors. We suppose GB is underdiagnosed in clinical practice by BI-RADS features.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017350v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017350v1.full.pdf","2020-01-20","Radiology and Imaging

"Behavioral and structural barriers to human post-exposure prophylaxis and other preventive practices during a canine rabies epidemic.","A canine rabies epidemic started in early 2015 in Arequipa, Peru; the rabies virus continues to circulate in the dog population. Some city residents who suffer dog bites do not seek care or do not complete indicated post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens, increasing the risk of human rabies. The objectives of our study were to qualitatively assess knowledge about rabies, and preventive practices, such as PEP vaccination, following a dog bite. We conducted eight focus group discussions in peri-urban and urban communities with 70 total participants. We observed low awareness of rabies severity and fatality. Participants, especially those in peri-urban communities, recounted applying herbs or the hair of the dog that bit them to wounds rather than seeking appropriate care. Misconceptions about rabies vaccines and mistreatment at health centers also commonly prevents initiating or completing PEP vaccination. We identify important behavioral and structural barriers and knowledge gaps that limit evidence-based preventive strategies against rabies and may threaten the successful prevention of dog-mediated human rabies in this setting.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20016394v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20016394v1.full.pdf","2020-01-20","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Procurement of innovation terminology usage in health care: A scoping review protocol","Background: Although procurement of innovation is an established policy tool used to stimulate collaboration between supply- and demand-side entities during the development of new technologies, there is little scientific literature describing the process as applied in health care settings. Furthermore, what literature exists contains inconsistencies of terms, definitions, and/or concepts related to procurement of innovation. This protocol details our process for a systematic scoping review to describe the current scope of literature and to provide terminology clarification. 
Methods: A search strategy will be used to search PubMed, EMBASE [OVID], CINAHL [EBSCO], PsycINFO [ProQUEST], ABI/INFORM, ISI Web of Knowledge, EBSCO, JSTOR, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar; grey literature, non-scientific reports, policy documents and expert recommendations will also be considered as additional sources for texts. Two researchers will screen titles and abstracts for inclusion/exclusion criteria, followed by full texts. We will extract the following data, if applicable: title, authors, date, author affiliations, country, journal/publication characteristics, setting, aims/purpose, methodology, sample characteristics, assessment/evaluation tools, outcome parameters, key findings, relevance, and terminology usage/definitions. Results will be presented narratively and visually. 
Discussion: This paper describes the steps of our proposed systematic scoping review to identify and analyse scientific and non-scientific literature related to procurement of innovation and/or innovation of procurement in health care settings, with a particular focus on digital health technologies. Results are intended to demonstrate the current scope of literature, to provide clarity in language and therefore to serve as a first step for further research in this growing field.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.19015107v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.19015107v1.full.pdf","2020-01-20","Health Systems and Quality Improvement

"Scaffolding the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Brain Using Random Noise Stimulation","Various methods have been attempted to effectively ameliorate psychiatric and neurological conditions in children and adults. One of the attractive ideas is to develop interventions to create a lasting, rather than only an immediate, effect. Neurostimulation has been shown to yield long-term effect when combined with cognitive training in healthy young adults. We examined whether such approach could benefit children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. We used a randomized double-blind active-controlled crossover study of 19 unmedicated children (aged 7-12 years old) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, who received either transcranial direct current stimulation or random noise stimulation while completing five-day executive functions training, which includes working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition tasks. Both stimulation protocols have previously shown potential for inducing lasting benefits in adults, while transcranial direct current stimulation was examined in multiple attention deficit hyperactivity disorder studies and has been highlighted as a promising method for treating neuropsychological deficits. For our primary outcome, transcranial random noise stimulation yielded a clinical improvement as indicated by the reduced attention deficit hyperactivity disorder rating scale score from baseline, and in comparison to the changes observed in transcranial direct current stimulation. Moreover, the effect of brain stimulation one week after completion of treatment yielded further improvement, suggesting a neuroplasticity-related effect. Finally, transcranial random noise stimulation improved working memory compared to transcranial direct current stimulation, and a larger transcranial random noise stimulation effect on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder rating scale was predicted for those patients who showed the greatest improvement in working memory. Our results provide a promising direction toward a novel intervention in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which is shown to have a lasting effect via the modulating of neuroplasticity, rather than a merely immediate effect as was shown for in previous medical interventions.","/content/10.1101/19005983v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005983v2.full.pdf","2020-01-21","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"The language network reemerges during recovery from severe traumatic brain injury","Regaining the ability to express and understand language is a key milestone for patients recovering from severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).  However, the neurobiological correlates of language recovery after TBI have not been identified. We explored whether recovery of language in patients with acute severe TBI is associated with functional MRI (fMRI) changes within and outside the canonical language network (i.e. bilateral superior temporal gyri [STG] and inferior frontal gyri [IFG]). We consecutively enrolled 16 adult patients with acute severe TBI and performed fMRI assessment using a spoken language stimulus in the intensive care unit.  Eight patients, all of whom recovered language function, returned for follow-up fMRI at median [interquartile range] 220.5 [189-473.5] days post-injury. Sixteen age- and sex-matched healthy subjects also completed the fMRI paradigm. Language function was behaviorally assessed immediately before fMRI using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised and components of the Confusion Assessment Protocol. At follow-up, patients also completed the California Verbal Learning Test-II.  We compared acute and follow-up fMRI responses by calculating mean Z-scores of suprathreshold voxels in bilateral STG and IFG regions-of-interest (ROI). We also performed a whole-brain analysis.  Significant longitudinal increases to language stimuli were found in the left STG but not the right STG, left IFG, or right IFG. Whole-brain analysis revealed longitudinal changes in the right supramarginal and middle temporal gyri, regions known to be involved in language processing.  Both acute and follow-up fMRI responses in patients were indistinguishable from those of healthy subjects at a stringent statistical threshold of Z = 3.1. At lower statistical thresholds (e.g. Z = 2.1) patients assessed acutely demonstrated decreased fMRI responses in right STG and IFG compared to healthy subjects. Collectively, these results provide initial evidence that responses in bihemispheric language-processing regions of cerebral cortex reemerge with recovery of language function in patients with severe TBI.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017004v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017004v1.full.pdf","2020-01-21","Neurology

"Uses of pathogen detection data to estimate vaccine direct effects in case-control studies","The diagnosis of infectious disease syndromes such as fever, diarrhea, and pneumonia is complicated by the potential for shedding or carriage of putatively etiologic pathogens among individuals experiencing symptoms due to other causes. Symptomatic individuals among whom a pathogen is detected, but whose symptoms are caused by other factors, may be misclassified by diagnostic criteria based on pathogen detection. Case-control studies are commonly undertaken to estimate vaccine effectiveness, and present an opportunity to compare pathogen detection among individuals with and without clinically-relevant symptoms. Considering this study context, we derive simple estimators for the direct effects of vaccination on various aspects of host susceptibility. These include protection against acquisition of the pathogen of interest, and protection against progression of this pathogen to disease following acquisition. We assess the impact of test sensitivity on these estimators, and extend our framework to identify a 'vaccine probe' estimator for pathogen-specific etiologic fractions. We also derive biases affecting vaccine effectiveness estimates under the test-negative design, an alternative approach using similar data. Our results provide strategies for estimation of pathogen-specific vaccine effectiveness in the absence a diagnostic gold standard. These approaches can inform the design and analysis of studies addressing numerous pathogens and vaccines.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017749v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017749v1.full.pdf","2020-01-21","Epidemiology

"Risk analysis of chewing betel quid among diabetic patients from the northeastern part of Bangladesh","Background: Betel quid (BQ) chewing is a common habit and a means of social interaction among the northeastern peoples of Bangladesh. Though this habit integrating in their daily life without knowing its toxic effect. Areca nut, which is one of the main components of BQ and may responsible for this addiction. Here, we assess to see how BQ chewing habit influence hyperglycemia among diabetic patients with respect to their lifestyle. 
Methodology: Random blood sugar (RBS) test was evaluated from a total of 961 diabetic patients. Behavioral data associated with their daily lifestyle were collected from August 2018 to February 2019 from Sylhet Diabetic Hospital, Bangladesh. Student's t-test, ANOVA and Fisher's exact test were used to assess the RBS status between BQ chewer and non-chewer patients.  
Results: Higher RBS was found in BQ chewer patients than non-chewer (mean  SEM, 263.3  4.768 vs. 251.0  5.915mg/dl). Interestingly, it is significantly higher in raw areca nut user than dry nut (mean  SEM, 278.0  8.790 vs. 252.1  6.835 mg/dl) only from BQ chewer group, suggesting that the habit of chewing raw nut may contribute to more hyperglycemic effect among diabetic patients. BQ habit enhances higher RBS level among smoker, non-smoker and patient's having walking habit. In addition, BQ habit significantly influence to have high RBS in patients with family history with diabetes. Lack of awareness being diabetes have also been observed significantly in BQ chewer patients, while a higher level of RBS was seen in BQ group, who work in different sectors with sitting activities. 
Conclusions: Diabetic patients who chew betel quid are more prone to keep higher hyperglycemic. Utmost attention should be taken to discourage the use of BQ for proper management of diabetes control.

"Motor cortex beta oscillations reflect motor skill learning ability after stroke","Recovery of skilled movement after stroke is assumed to depend on motor learning. However, the capacity for motor learning and factors that influence motor learning after stroke have received little attention. In this study we firstly compared motor skill acquisition and retention between well-recovered stroke patients and age- and performance-matched healthy controls. We then tested whether beta oscillations (15-30Hz) from sensorimotor cortices contribute to predicting training-related motor performance. Eighteen well-recovered chronic stroke survivors (mean age 64+/-8 years, range 50-74 years) and twenty age- and sex-matched healthy controls were trained on a continuous tracking task and subsequently retested after initial training (45-60 min and 24 hours later). Scalp EEG was recorded during the performance of a simple motor task before each training and retest session. Stroke patients demonstrated capacity for motor skill learning, but it was diminished compared to age- and performance-matched healthy controls. Further, although the properties of beta oscillations prior to training were comparable between stroke patients and healthy controls, stroke patients did show less change in beta measures with motor learning. Lastly, although beta oscillations did not help to predict motor performance immediately after training, contralateral (ipsilesional) sensorimotor cortex post-movement beta rebound (PMBR) measured after training helped predict future motor performance, 24 hours after training. This finding suggests that neurophysiological measures such as beta oscillations can help predict response to motor training in chronic stroke patients and may offer novel targets for therapeutic interventions.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017665v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017665v1.full.pdf","2020-01-21","Radiology and Imaging

"Venous Thromboembolism and Intracranial Hemorrhage in Patients with High-grade Glioma","Background: Patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), throughout the course of disease. Prophylactic anticoagulation is not established among patients with HGG, outside of perioperative context, due to potential for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the limited data available for predictive VTE scores in primary brain tumors. The aim of this study was to characterize VTE prevalence in adult patients with HGG and assess ICH risk during therapeutic anticoagulation.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with HGG at our institution, between 2009 and 2018. All adult patients proposed to systemic treatment were included into this study. Exclusion criteria was anticoagulation previous to diagnosis. VTE was defined as any radiographic-confirmed thrombus in the venous system. Risk factors of interest for VTE and bleeding risk scores were analyzed by chi-squared test and multivariate logistic regression. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.
Results: A total of 410 patients were included of whom 31 (7,8%) developed a VTE, including 22 deep vein, 6 pulmonary and 3 central venous thrombosis. Twenty-nine patients with VTE had a WHO grade 4 glioma and 2 patients had grade 3 (anaplastic astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma). In 22 cases, the VTE occurred during systemic treatment, more frequently during Temozolomide (n=15), followed by Irinotecan+Bevacizumab (n=6), Lomustine+Bevacizumab (n=1) and PCV (n=1). The median time between diagnosis and VTE was 10,11 months (95CI 6,46-14,79). Khorana score, age, ECOG performance status, smoking and obesity did not significantly differ in the VTE population. All VTE were initially treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), of which 64.5% maintained LMWH, and the remainder switched to warfarin (19.4%) or to direct oral anticoagulant (16.1%). Six patients (19,4%) had spontaneous ICH under anticoagulation. Patients with grade 3 glioma (p=0,032) had significantly higher rates of ICH than grade 4. Patients with higher ECOG had significantly higher risk of ICH (OR 3,23 (95CI 1,18-8,81), p=0,022). HAS-BLED and ACCP bleeding scores were not associated with ICH. There was no significant difference in overall survival for TVE or ICH.
Conclusion: According to our data, ICH occurred in nearly 20% anticoagulated patients with HGG, as described in literature, and did not correlate with poorer prognosis. High ECOG performance status was an independent risk factor for ICH. Further effort towards better prediction models for VTE and ICH in HGG is warranted.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20017475v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20017475v1.full.pdf","2020-01-21","Oncology

"The relationship between antihypertensive medications and mood disorders: analysis of linked healthcare data for 1.8 million patients.","Background: Recent work suggests that antihypertensive medications may be useful as repurposed treatments for mood disorders. Using large-scale linked healthcare data we investigated whether certain classes of antihypertensive, such as angiotensin antagonists and calcium channel blockers, were associated with reduced risk of new-onset Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder.

Method: Two cohorts of patients treated with antihypertensives were identified from Scottish prescribing (2009-2016) and hospital admission (1981-2016) records. Eligibility for cohort membership was determined by receipt of a minimum of four prescriptions for antihypertensives within a 12-month window. One treatment cohort (n=538,730) included patients with no previous history of mood disorder, whereas the other (n=262,278) included those who did. Both cohorts were matched by age, sex and area deprivation to untreated comparators. Associations between antihypertensive treatment and new-onset MDD or bipolar episodes were investigated using Cox regression.

Results: For patients without a history of mood disorder, antihypertensives were associated with increased risk of new-onset MDD. For angiotensin antagonist monotherapy, the hazard ratio (HR) for new-onset MDD was 1.17 (95%CI 1.04-1.31). Beta blockers' association was stronger (HR 2.68; 95%CI 2.45-2.92), possibly indicating pre-existing anxiety. Some classes of antihypertensive were associated with protection against bipolar disorder, particularly angiotensin antagonists (HR 0.46; 95%CI 0.30-0.70). For patients with a past history of mood disorders, all classes of antihypertensives were associated with increased risk of future episodes of MDD.

"Frequent Daytime Napping is Detrimental to Human Health: A phenotype-wide Mendelian Randomization Study","Background: It remains controversial whether daytime napping is beneficial for human health. 
Objective: To examine the causal relationship between daytime napping and the risk for various human diseases.
Design: Phenotype-wide Mendelian randomization study.
Setting Non-UK Biobank cohorts reported in published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provided the outcome phenotypes in the discovery stage. The UK Biobank cohort provided the outcome phenotypes in the validation stage.
Participants: The UK Biobank GWAS included 361,194 European-ancestry residents in the UK. Non-UKBB GWAS included various numbers of participants.
Exposure: Self-reported daytime napping frequency.
Main outcome measure: A wide-spectrum of human health outcomes including obesity, major depressive disorder, and high cholesterol.
Methods: We examined the causal relationship between daytime napping frequency in the UK Biobank as exposure and a panel of 1,146 health outcomes reported in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), using a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. The significant findings were further validated in the UK Biobank health outcomes of 4,203 human traits and diseases. The causal effects were estimated using a fixed-effects inverse variance weighted model. MR-Egger intercept test was applied to detect horizontal pleiotropy, along with Cochran's Q test to assess heterogeneity among the causal effects of IVs. 
Findings: There were significant causal relationships between daytime napping frequency and a wide spectrum of human health outcomes. In particular, we validated that frequent daytime napping increased the risks of major depressive disorder, obesity and abnormal lipid profile. 
Interpretation: The current study showed that frequent daytime napping mainly had adverse impacts on physical and mental health. Cautions should be taken for health recommendations on daytime napping. Further studies are necessary to precisely define the best daytime napping strategies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.20017723v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.20017723v1.full.pdf","2020-01-23","Public and Global Health

"Clinical utility of Basophil and B-cell biomarkers for monitoring disease activity in food allergy and food oral immunotherapy","As research in the field of food allergy is gaining momentum with new and emerging therapies there is need for both researchers and clinicians to have a better understanding on how to put all this new information into context in clinical care. We are continuously learning from other fields, such as oncology, that a one-shoe-fits all type approaches are becoming the practice of the past and there is need to incorporate markers of disease activity as well as drug selection into clinical care. In the United States, this can happen in two ways; laboratory developed testing and companion diagnostics, generally former leading the path to the later. The findings in this letter is a collaboration between four CLIA/CAP accredited in-office flow cytometry laboratories in Utah, New York and Virginia that are part of very busy food allergy clinics directed by board certified Allergist/Immunologists. The identification of changes in basophils and B cells during oral food immunotherapy are proving to be potentially useful markers in monitoring these patients. We show a high ratio of CD63 to CD203c and  CD73 expression on B-cells, compared to healthy non-allergic controls and patients who have outgrown their food allergies. This ratio of basophil surface markers as well as B cell CD73 expression drops as patients are undergoing food-OIT. Quite interestingly, we see a similar low pattern in patients who have non-releaser basophils. Altogether these biomarkers are providing useful and important information monitoring patients and we have validated these assays for clinical use as laboratory developed tests. The Basophil Activation Test is used much more routinely outside the United States, and the powerful correlation it provides to oral food challenge outcomes is making it a very attractive tool. We have just submitted two manuscripts on the validation of the BAT as well as sample stability which is under review elsewhere. We expect more utility of the BAT in the United States in the future. Incorporating biomarkers to clinical care of patients with food allergies will provide to be important in assessing efficacy as well as complications of various therapies as well as monitoring the natural resolution of the food allergies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017541v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017541v1.full.pdf","2020-01-23","Allergy and Immunology

"Metastatic breast cancer patient perception of somatic tumor genomic testing","Purpose: To assess metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patient perceptions and comprehension of tumor
genomic testing and to evaluate associations with psychological wellbeing.
Methods: In a prospective, single institution, single-arm trial, patients with MBC underwent next-generation sequencing at study entry, with sequencing results released at progression. Patients who completed surveys before undergoing sequencing were included in the study (n=58). We administered four validated psychosocial measures: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Trust in Physician Scale, and Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy scale for Cancer. Genetic comprehension was assessed using 7-question objective and 6-question subjective measures. Longitudinal data were assessed using paired Wilcoxon signed rank and McNemars test of agreement.
Results: There were no significant differences between the beginning and end of study in depression, anxiety, physician trust, or self efficacy (median time on study: 7.6 months). Depression and anxiety were positively associated with each other and both negatively associated with self-efficacy. Self-efficacy decreased from pre- to post-genomic testing (p=0.05). There was a wide range of objective genetics comprehension and comprehension was significantly lower in non-white patients (p=0.02) and patients with lower income (p=0.04). Patients expressed increased confidence in their ability to teach others about genetics at end of study.
Conclusions: This is the only study, to our knowledge, to longitudinally evaluate multiple psychological metrics in MBC as patients undergo tumor genomic testing. Among patients with MBC, depression and anxiety metrics were negatively correlated with patient self-efficacy. Patients undergoing somatic genomic testing had limited genomic knowledge, which varied by demographic groups.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.19015404v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.19015404v1.full.pdf","2020-01-23","Oncology

"Predicting Alcohol Dependence from Multi-Site Brain Structural Measures","Abstract
Background 
The search for neuroimaging biomarkers of alcohol use disorder (AUD) has primarily been restricted to significance testing in small datasets of low diversity. To identify neurobiological markers beyond individual differences, it may be useful to develop classification models for AUD. The ever-increasing quantity of neuroimaging data demands methods that are robust to the complexities of multi-site designs and are generalizable to data from new scanners.
Methods
This study represents a mega-analysis of previously published datasets from 2,034 AUD and comparison participants spanning 27 sites, coordinated by the ENIGMA Addiction Working Group. Data were grouped into a training set including 1,652 participants (692 AUD, 24 sites), and test set with 382 participants (146 AUD, 3 sites). A battery of machine learning classifiers was evaluated using repeated random cross-validation (CV) and leave-site-out CV. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was our base metric of performance. 
Results 
Multi-objective evolutionary search was conducted to identify sparse, generalizable, and high performing subsets of brain measurements. Cortical thickness in the left superior frontal gyrus and right lateral orbitofrontal cortex, cortical surface area in the right transverse temporal gyrus, and left putamen volume, appeared most frequently across searches. Restricting a regularized logistic regression model to these four features yielded a test-set AUC of .768.
Conclusions
Developing classification models on multi-site data with varied underlying class distributions poses unique challenges. Supplementing datasets with controls from new sites and performing feature selection increases generalizability. Four features identified by evolutionary search may serve as specific biomarkers for individuals with current AUD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20016873v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20016873v1.full.pdf","2020-01-23","Addiction Medicine

"Tumor Mutational Burden Predicts Survival In Patients With Low Grade Gliomas Expressing Mutated IDH1","Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. High Grade Gliomas have a median survival of 18 months, while Low Grade Gliomas (LGG) have a median survival of ~7.3 years. Seventy-six percent of patients with LGG express mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase (mIDH1) enzyme (IDH1R132H). Survival of these patients ranges from 1-15 years, and tumor mutational burden ranges from 8 to 447 total somatic mutations per tumor. We tested the hypothesis that the tumor mutational burden would predict survival of patients with tumors bearing mIDH1R132H. We analyzed the effect of tumor mutational burden on patients survival using clinical and genomic data of 1199 glioma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas and validated our results using the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas. High tumor mutational burden negatively correlates with survival of patients with LGG harboring IDH1R132H (p<0.0001). This effect was significant for both Oligodendroglioma and Astrocytoma LGG-mIDH1 patients. In the TCGA data, median survival of the high mutational burden group was 76 months, while in the low mutational burden group it was 136 months; p<0.0001. There was no differential representation of frequently mutated genes (e.g., TP53, ATRX, CIC, FUBP) in either group. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed an enrichment in Gene Ontologies related to Cell cycle, DNA damage response in high vs low tumor mutational burden. Finally, we identified a 19 gene signature that predicts survival for patients from both databases. In summary, we demonstrate that tumor mutational burden is a powerful, robust, and clinically relevant prognostic factor of median survival in mIDH1 patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.20016766v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.20016766v1.full.pdf","2020-01-23","Oncology

"An end-to-end workflow for statistical analysis and inference of large-scale biomedical datasets","Throughout time, as medical and epidemiological studies have grown larger in scale, the challenges associated with extracting useful and relevant information from these data has mounted. General health surveys provide a good example for such studies as they usually cover large populations and are conducted throughout long periods in multiple locations. The challenges associated with interpreting the results of such studies include: the presence of both categorical and continuous variables and the need to compare them within a single statistical framework; the presence of variations in data resulting from the technical limitations in data collection; the danger of selection and information biases in hypothesis-directed study design and implementation; and the complete inadequacy of p values in identifying significant relationships. As a solution to these challenges, we propose an end-to-end analysis workflow using the MUltivariate analysis and VISualization (MUVIS) package within R statistical software. MUVIS consists of a comprehensive set of statistical tools that follow the basic tenet of unbiased exploration of associations within a dataset. We validate its performance by applying MUVIS to data from the Yazd Health Study (YaHS). YaHS is a prospective cohort study consisting of a general health survey of more than 30 health-related measurements and a questionnaire with over 300 questions acquired from 10050 participants. Given the nature of the YaHS dataset, most of the identified associations are corroborated by a large body of medical literature. Nevertheless, some more interesting and less investigated connections were also found which are presented here. We conclude that MUVIS provides a robust statistical framework for extraction of useful and relevant information from medical datasets and their visualization in easily comprehensible ways.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017095v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.09.20017095v2.full.pdf","2020-01-23","Health Informatics

"Transcranial random noise stimulation for the acute treatment of depression: a randomized-controlled trial","Background
Transcranial electrical stimulation has broad potential as a treatment for depression. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), which delivers randomly fluctuating current intensities, may have greater cortical excitatory effects compared to other forms of transcranial electrical stimulation. We therefore aimed to investigate the antidepressant efficacy of tRNS. 
Methods
Depressed participants were randomly assigned by computer number generator to receive 20 sessions of either active or sham tRNS over four weeks in a double-blinded, parallel group randomized-controlled trial. tRNS was delivered for 30mins with a direct current offset of 2mA and a random noise range of 2mA. Primary analyses assessed changes in depression severity using the Montgomery-Asperg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Neuroplasticity, neuropsychological, and safety outcomes were analysed as secondary measures. 
Results
69 participants were randomised, of which three discontinued treatment early leaving 66 (sham n = 34, active n = 32) for per-protocol analysis. Depression severity scores reduced in both groups (MADRS reduction in sham = 7.0 [95%CI 5.0-8.9]; and active = 5.2 [95%CI 3.2-7.3]). However, there were no differences between active and sham groups in the reduction of depressive symptoms, or the number of participants meeting response (sham = 14.7%; active = 3.1%) and remission criteria (sham = 5.9%; active = 0%). Erythema, paraesthesia, fatigue, and dizziness/light-headedness occurred more frequently in the active tRNS group. Neuroplasticity, neuropsychological and acute cognitive effects were comparable between groups.
Conclusion
Our results do not support the use of tRNS with the current stimulation parameters as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of depression.

"Cost-effectiveness of the next generation of RSV intervention strategies","Background:
With a suite of promising new RSV prophylactics on the horizon, including long-acting monoclonal antibodies and new vaccines, it is likely that one or more of these will replace the current monoclonal Palivizumab programme. However, choosing the optimal intervention programme will require balancing the costs of the programmes with the health benefits accrued. 

Methods:
To compare the next generation of RSV prophylactics, we integrated a novel transmission model with an economic analysis. We estimated key epidemiological parameters by calibrating the model to seven years of historical epidemiological data using a Bayesian approach. We determined the cost-effective and affordable maximum purchase price for a comprehensive suite of intervention programmes. 
 
Findings:
Our transmission model suggests that maternal protection of infants is seasonal, with 2-14% of infants born with protection against RSV. Our economic analysis found that to cost-effectively and affordably replace the current monoclonal antibody Palivizumab programme with long-acting monoclonal antibodies, the purchase price per dose would have to be less than around <U+FFE1>4,350 but dropping to <U+FFE1>200 for vaccinated heightened risk infants or <U+FFE1>90 for all infants. A seasonal maternal vaccine would have to be priced less than <U+FFE1>85 to be cost-effective and affordable. While vaccinating pre-school and school-age children is likely not cost-effective relative to elderly vaccination programmes, vaccinating the elderly is not likely to be affordable. Conversely, vaccinating infants at 2 months seasonally would be cost-effective and affordable if priced less than <U+FFE1>80.
 
Interpretations:
In a setting with seasonal RSV epidemiology, maternal protection conferred to newborns is also seasonal, an assumption not previously incorporated in transmission models of RSV. For a country with seasonal RSV dynamics like England, seasonal programmes rather than year-round intervention programmes are always optimal.","/content/10.1101/19009977v4?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009977v4.full.pdf","2020-01-23","Public and Global Health

"Beware (surprisingly common) left-right flips in your MRI data: an efficient and robust method to check MRI dataset consistency using AFNI","Knowing the difference between left and right is generally assumed throughout the brain MRI research community. However, we note widespread occurrences of left-right orientation errors in MRI open database repositories where volumes have contained systematic left-right flips between subject EPIs and anatomicals, due to having incorrect or missing file header information. Here we present a simple method in AFNI for determining the consistency of left and right within a  pair of acquired volumes for a particular subject;  the presence of EPI-anatomical inconsistency, for example, is a sign that dataset header information likely requires correction.  The method contains both a quantitative evaluation as well as a visualizable verification. We test the functionality using publicly available datasets. Left-right flipping is not immediately obvious in most cases, so we also present visualization methods for looking at this problem (and other potential problems), using examples from both FMRI and DTI datasets.","/content/10.1101/19009787v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009787v3.full.pdf","2020-01-24","Radiology and Imaging

"The cost-effectiveness of mammography-based female breast cancer screening in Canadian populations: a systematic review","Introduction
Mammography-based breast cancer screening is an important aspect of female breast cancer prevention within the Canadian healthcare system. The current literature on female breast cancer screening is largely focused on the health outcomes that result from screening. There is comparatively little data on the cost-effectiveness of the screening. Therefore, this paper sought to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the cost effectiveness of mammography-based breast cancer screening within female Canadian populations. 

Materials and methods
A systematic review was performed in the PubMed database to identify all studies published within the last 10 years that addressed breast cancer screening and evaluate cost-effectiveness in a Canadian population. 

Results
The search yielded five studies for inclusion, only three of which were applicable to average-risk Canadian women. The benefits of mortality reduction rose approximately linearly with costs, while costs were linearly dependent on the number of lifetime screens per woman. Moreover, triennial screening for average-risk women aged 50-69 years was found to be the most cost-effective in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year. The use of MRI in conjunction with mammography for women with the BRCA 1/2 mutation was found to be cost-effective while annual mammography-based screening for women with dense breasts was found to be cost-ineffective. 

Conclusion
In spite of the growing interest to enhance breast cancer screening programs, analyses of the cost-effectiveness of mammography-based screening within Canadian populations are scarcely reported and have heterogeneous methodologies. The existing data suggests that Canada's current breast cancer screening policy to screen average-risk women aged 50-74, biennially or triennially is cost-effective. These findings could be of interest to health policy makers when making decisions regarding resource allocation; however, further studies in this field are required in order to make stronger recommendations regarding cost-effectiveness.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.18.20018044v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.18.20018044v1.full.pdf","2020-01-24","Public and Global Health

"Utilizing novel fluorothymidine PET imaging in a phase I study of veliparib on an intermittent and continuous schedule given in combination with carboplatin in metastatic breast cancer","Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors are FDA-approved for treatment of BRCA mutated metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Prior studies demonstrated benefit of adding oral PARPi veliparib to carboplatin and paclitaxel in BRCA mutation positive patients with MBC. We sought to find the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and schedule of veliparib in combination with carboplatin in patients with advanced breast cancer, either triple negative (TNBC) or hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2-negative with defective functional Fanconi Anemia (FA) DNA-repair pathway. Patients received escalating doses of veliparib on a 7, 14, or 21-day schedule with carboplatin every 3 weeks. Patients underwent [18]fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine (18FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, assessed in a blinded fashion. Forty-four patients (39 TNBC, 5 HR-positive/HER2-negative with a defective FA pathway) received a median of 5 cycles (range 1-36). Observed DLTs were grade (G) 4 thrombocytopenia (N=4), G4 neutropenia (N=1) and G3 akathisia (N=1). Common grade 3-4 toxicities included thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and fatigue. Of 43 patients evaluable for response, 18.6% achieved partial response and 48.8% had stable disease.  Median progression free survival was 18.3 weeks. RP2D of veliparib was established at 250 mg twice daily on days 1-21 along with carboplatin at AUC 5. Patients with partial response had significant drop in SUVmax of target lesions between baseline and early 18FLT-PET (day 7-21; ptrend=0.006). Continuous dosing of veliparib and every three week carboplatin demonstrated activity and acceptable toxicity. Decrease in SUVmax on 18FLT-PET scan during the first cycle of this therapy can identify patients likely to have a response.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.20018218v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.20018218v1.full.pdf","2020-01-24","Oncology

"Machine-learning forecasting for Dengue epidemics - Comparing LSTM, Random Forest and Lasso regression","Effective management of seasonal diseases such as dengue fever depends on 
timely deployment of control measures prior to the high transmission season. 
As the epidemic season fluctuates from year to year, the availability of 
accurate forecasts of incidence can be decisive in attaining control of such 
diseases. Obtaining such forecasts from classical time series models has proven a 
difficult task. Here we propose and compare machine learning models 
incorporating feature selection,such as LASSO and Random 
Forest regression with LSTM a deep recurrent neural network, to forecast 
weekly dengue incidence in 790 cities in Brazil. We use 
multivariate time-series as predictors and also utilize time series from similar 
cities to capture the spatial component of disease transmission. Among the

"Feasibility of estimation of aortic wave intensity using non-invasive pressure recordings in the absence of flow velocity in man.","Background: Wave intensity analysis provides valuable information on ventriculo-arterial function, hemodynamics and energy transfer in the arterial circulation. Widespread use of wave intensity analysis is limited by the need for concurrent measurement of pressure and flow waveforms. We describe a method that can estimate wave intensity patterns using only non-invasive pressure waveforms, and its reproducibility.
Methods: Radial artery pressure and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) flow velocity waveforms were recorded in 12 participants in the Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE) study. Pressure waveforms were analysed using custom-written software to derive the excess pressure (Pxs) which was compared with the LVOT flow velocity waveform, and used to calculate wave intensity. In a separate study, repeat measures of wave intensity and other wave and reservoir parameters were performed on 34 individuals who attended 2 clinic visits at an interval of approximately 1 month to assess reproducibility and reliability of the method.
Results: Pxs waveforms were similar in shape to aortic flow velocity waveforms and the time of peak Pxs and maximum aortic velocity agreed closely (mean difference = 0.00 (limits of agreement -0.02, 0.02)s). Wave intensity patterns when scaled to peak LVOT velocity gave credible estimates of wave intensity similar to values reported previously in the literature. The method showed fair to good reproducibility for most parameters.
Conclusions: The Pxs is a surrogate of LVOT flow velocity allowing estimation of aortic wave intensity with acceptable reproducibility. This enables widespread application of wave intensity analysis to large studies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018457v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018457v1.full.pdf","2020-01-24","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is thought to have emerged into the human population in Wuhan, China. The number of identified cases in Wuhan has increased rapidly since, and cases have been identified in other Chinese cities and other countries (as of 23 January 2020). 

We fitted a transmission model to reported case information up to 21 January to estimate key epidemiological measures, and to predict the possible course of the epidemic, as the potential impact of travel restrictions into and from Wuhan. 

We estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection (R_0) to be 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0), indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing. We estimate that only 5.1% (95%CI, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, and by 21 January a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict the epidemic in Wuhan will be substantially larger by 4 February (191,529 infections; prediction interval, 132,751-273,649), infection will be established in other Chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent. Our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on 4 February. 

Our findings are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model, and the timing and reporting of confirmed cases, and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak at this early stage. With these caveats in mind, our work suggests that a basic reproductive number for this 2019-nCoV outbreak is higher compared to other emergent coronaviruses, suggesting that containment or control of this pathogen may be substantially more difficult.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v1.full.pdf","2020-01-24","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Comparison of Machine Learning Approaches in Prediction of Bone Mineral Density in Elderly Men","Bone mineral density (BMD) is a highly heritable trait with heritability ranging from 50% to 80%. Numerous BMD-associated Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered by GWAS and GWAS meta-analysis. However, several studies found that combining these highly significant SNPs together only explained a small percentage of BMD variance. This inconsistency may be caused by limitations of the linear regression approaches employed, because these traditional approaches lack the flexibility and the adequacy to model complex gene interactions and regulations. Hence, we developed various machine learning models of genomic data and ran experiments to identify the best machine learning model for BMD prediction at three different sites. We used genomic data of Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) cohort Study (N=5,133) for analysis. Genotype imputation was conducted at the Sanger Imputation Server. A total of 1,103 BMD-associated SNPs were identified and corresponding weighted genetic risk scores were calculated. Genetic variants, as well as age and other traditional BMD predictors, were included for modeling. Data were normalized and were split into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). BMD prediction models were built separately by random forest, gradient boosting, and neural network algorithms. Linear regression was used as a reference model. We applied the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for the measurement of MSE in each model for the pair-wise model comparison. We found that gradient boosting shows the lowest MSE for each BMD site and a prediction model built using the machine learning models achieves improved performance when a large number of SNPs are included in the models. With the predictors of phenotype covariate + 1,103 SNPs, all of the models were statistically significant except neural network vs. random forest at femoral neck BMD and gradient boosting vs. random forest at total hip BMD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.20018143v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.20018143v1.full.pdf","2020-01-24","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Background styles in systematic review articles: a cross-sectional study protocol","Background: The background section of a medical journal article has the important function to communicate readers the value of the research question. However, little is known about how authors describe their ""niche"" to emphasize the importance of their research question. This study aims to examine the methods the authors use in order to delineate their niche in systematic reviews (SR).
Methods: We will conduct a cross-sectional study. We will include Original SR articles published in top 50 journals in MEDICINE, GENERAL & INTERNAL category in Journal Citation Reports 2018. We will conduct content analysis of background sections. The primary outcome will be whether the article was published in top 10 journal or not. We will use chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis. The primary analysis will be logistic regression predicting publication in high impact journals, with covariates. Two-tailed p values will be considered statistically significant if less than 0.05.

"Convergent cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence for gaming-cue specific posterior parietal dysregulations in early stages of Internet Gaming Disorder","Exaggerated reactivity to drug-cues and emotional dysregulations represent key symptoms of early stages of substance use disorders. The diagnostic criteria for (Internet) Gaming Disorder strongly resemble symptoms for substance-related addictions. However, previous cross-sections studies revealed inconsistent results with respect to neural cue reactivity and emotional dysregulations in these populations. To this end the present fMRI study applied a combined cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal design in excessive online gamers (n=37) and gaming-naive controls (n=67). To separate gaming-associated changes from predisposing factors, gaming-naive subjects were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of daily Internet gaming or a non-gaming condition. At baseline and after the training subjects underwent an fMRI paradigm presenting gaming-related cues and non-gaming related emotional stimuli. Cross-sectional comparisons revealed gaming-cue specific enhanced valence attribution and neural reactivity in a parietal network, including the posterior cingulate/precuneus in excessive gamers as compared to gaming naive-controls. Prospective analysis revealed that six weeks of gaming elevated valence ratings as well as neural cue-reactivity in a similar parietal network, specifically the posterior cingulate/precuneus in previously gaming-naive controls. Together, the prospective longitudinal design did not reveal supporting evidence for altered emotional processing of non-gaming associated stimuli in excessive gamers while convergent evidence for increased emotional and neural reactivity to gaming-associated stimuli was observed. Findings suggest that exaggerated neural reactivity in posterior parietal regions engaged in self-referential processing already occur during early stages of regular gaming probably promoting continued engagement in gaming behavior.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.18.20018036v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.18.20018036v1.full.pdf","2020-01-24","Addiction Medicine

"Human CA1 and subiculum activity forecast stroke chronicity","Following a stroke, the brain undergoes a process of neuronal reorganization to compensate for structural damage and cope with functionality loss. Increases in stroke-induced neurogenesis rates in the dentate gyrus and neural migration from the hippocampus towards the affected site have been observed, suggesting that the hippocampus is involved in functionality gains and neural reorganization. Despite the observed hippocampal contributions to structural changes, the hippocampal physiology for stroke recovery has been poorly characterized. To this end, we measured resting-state whole-brain activity from non-hippocampal stroke survivors (n=13) during functional MRI scanning. Analysis of multiple hippocampal subregions revealed that the voxel activity of hippocampal readout sites (CA1 and subiculum) forecast the patient's chronicity stage stronger than early regions of the hippocampal circuit. Furthermore, we observed hemispheric-specific contributions to chronicity forecasting, raising the hypothesis that left and right hippocampus are functionally dissociable during recovery. In addition, we suggest that in contrast with whole-brain analysis, the monitoring of segregated and specialized sub-networks after stroke potentially reveals detailed aspects of stroke recovery. Altogether, our results shed light on the contribution of the subcortical-cortical interplay for neural reorganization and highlight new avenues for stroke rehabilitation.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.19.20017996v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.19.20017996v1.full.pdf","2020-01-24","Neurology

"Trends in Prescriptions of Lithium and Other Medications for Patients with Bipolar Disorder in Office-based Practices in the United States: 1996-2015","Background
Studies have shown that rates of lithium use for bipolar disorder (BPD) in the United States declined through the 1990s as other mood stabilizing anticonvulsants and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) became more popular.  We examined recent prescribing trends of medications for BPD over the past two decades.    
Methods
Twenty years of data (1996-2015) from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) were used. Weighted percentages of prescriptions of lithium, anticonvulsants, SGAs and antidepressants were calculated over two-year intervals.  Logistic regression was used to examine factors related to polytherapy.  
Results
Prescriptions of lithium declined from 38.1% (95%CI: 29.8% - 46.3%) in 1996-97 to 14.3% (95%CI: 10.6% - 18.1%) in 2006-07 and has remained stable since.  During this time, prescriptions of SGAs more than doubled. SGAs and/or anticonvulsants were prescribed in 78.6% (95%CI: 73.0% - 84.2%) of BPD visits in 2014-2015.  Polytherapy increased by approximately 4% every two years and in 2014-15 occurred in over 35% of BPD visits.  Antidepressants were prescribed in 40-50% of BPD visits, but their prescriptions without other mood stabilizers decreased from 18.2% (95%CI: 11.7% - 24.8%) in 1998-99 to 5.8% (95%CI: 3.0% - 8.6%) in 2014-15.  
Limitations
The sample had limited power to study the effect of individual medications or the potential for differing effects in certain subgroups of patients.
Conclusions
This study further documents the declining prescriptions of lithium for BPD, and corresponding increase in prescriptions of anticonvulsants and SGAs, despite the fact that lithium is typically recommended as a first line therapy for BPD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.18.20018028v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.18.20018028v1.full.pdf","2020-01-24","Epidemiology

"Implicit and explicit motor learning interventions for gait in people after stroke: a process evaluation on fidelity and feasibility performed alongside a randomized controlled trial","Purpose:  To evaluate whether the implicit and explicit motor learning walking interventions for people after stroke delivered in a randomized controlled trial were performed as intended (fidelity) and to report the therapist and participant experiences with regard to feasibility.
 Methods:  Dose delivered and content of instructions were assessed by evaluating the therapist logs and audio recordings of the training sessions. The therapist and participant experiences were assessed by means of self-developed questionnaires. 
 Results:  79 people were included of which seven people (9%) dropped out. The remaining participants all received the required minimum of seven sessions. Overall therapists adhered to the intervention guideline. On average 5.2 and 0.4 explicit rules were used within the explicit group and implicit group respectively. Therapists and participants were generally positive about the feasibility but frequent comments were made by the therapists regarding therapy <q> time restrictions </q and <q> tendency of the participants to develop explicit rules </q. A variety of changes were observed ranging from improvements in spatiotemporal parameters to cognitions and emotions.

"Immunotherapy Implication of Signature-Guided Biomarker Discovery for Trastuzumab-Resistant HER2-Positive Breast Cancer","Despite the great improvement of patient outcomes by trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeted on HER2-positive breast cancer, approximately 23% of patients with early-stage disease treated with adjuvant trastuzumab either fail to respond or experience recurrence within 10 years, highlighting the importance of identifying which HER2-positive patients would benefit from trastuzumab upfront. Efforts to identify biomarkers predictive of response to trastuzumab in initial breast tumor core biopsies have been complicated by the clinical and biological heterogeneity of HER2-positive tumors. Therefore, we identified a trastuzumab-resistant (TrR) signature that accurately predicts response to trastuzumab quantitively and qualitatively in vitro and in vivo, via repurposing transcriptome profiles in an engineered cell line model. We additionally demonstrated that our TrR signature was associated with tumor progression and capable of stratifying patient prognosis. Our study further illustrated the possible mechanism of this resistance as being less inherited cytotoxic T cell infiltration and failure to secrete Interferon-<U+03B3> upon trastuzumab treatment in TrR tumors. These findings highlight the potential clinical application of TrR signature in treatment management and identifying possible immunotherapy interventions.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20017947v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.20017947v1.full.pdf","2020-01-24","Oncology

"Machine learning to identify socio-behavioural predictors of HIV positivity in East and Southern Africa","Background: There is a need for high yield HIV testing strategies to reach epidemic control. We aimed to predict the HIV status of individuals based on socio-behavioural characteristics.
Methods: We analysed over 3,200 variables from the most recent Demographic Health Survey from 10 countries in East and Southern Africa. We trained four machine-learning algorithms and selected the best based on the f1 score. Training and validation were done on 80% of the data. The model was tested on the remaining 20% and on a left-out country which was rotated around. The best algorithm was retrained on the variables which were most predictive. We studied two scenarios: one aiming to identify 95% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and one aiming to identify individuals with 95% or higher probability of being HIV positive.
Findings: Overall 55,151 males and 69,626 females were included. XGBoost performed best in predicting HIV with a mean f1 of 76.8% [95% confidence interval 76.0%-77.6%] for males and 78.8% [78.2%-79.4%] for females. Among the ten most predictive variables, nine were identical for both sexes: longitude, latitude and, altitude of place of residence, current age, age of most recent partner, total lifetime number of sexual partners, years lived in current place of residence, condom use during last intercourse and, wealth index. Model performance based on these variables decreased minimally. For the first scenario, 7 males and 5 females would need to be tested to identify one HIV positive person. For the second scenario, 4.2% of males and 6.2% of females would have been identified as high-risk population.
Interpretation: We were able to identify PLHIV and those at high risk of infection who may be offered pre-exposure prophylaxis and/or voluntary medical male circumcision. These findings can inform the implementation of HIV prevention and testing strategies.

"Plasma proteomics reveals markers of metabolic stress in HIV infected children with severe acute malnutrition","HIV infection affects up to 30% of children presenting with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Africa and is associated with increased mortality. Children with SAM are treated similarly regardless of HIV status, although mechanisms of nutritional recovery in HIV and/or SAM are not well understood. We performed a secondary analysis of a clinical trial and plasma proteomics data among children with complicated SAM in Kenya and Malawi. Compared to children with SAM without HIV (n = 113), HIV-infected children (n = 54) had evidence (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p<0.05) of metabolic stress, including enriched pathways related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. Moreover, we observed reduced plasma levels of zinc-a-2-glycoprotein, butyrylcholinesterase, and increased levels of complement C2 resembling findings in metabolic syndrome, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. HIV was also associated (FDR corrected p<0.05) with higher plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines. Considering evidence of biomarkers of metabolic stress, it is of potential concern that our current treatment strategy for SAM regardless of HIV status involves a high-fat therapeutic diet. The results of this study suggest a need for clinical trials of therapeutic foods that meet the specific metabolic needs of children with HIV and SAM.","/content/10.1101/19006726v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006726v2.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Nutrition

"Targetable ERBB2 mutation status is an independent marker of adverse prognosis in estrogen receptor positive, ERBB2 non-amplified primary lobular breast carcinoma: a retrospective in silico analysis of public datasets","BACKGROUND: Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of primary breast cancers and is typically estrogen receptor alpha positive (ER+) and ERBB2 non-amplified. Somatic mutations in ERBB2/3 are emerging as a tractable mechanism underlying enhanced human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) activity. We tested the hypothesis that therapeutically targetable ERBB2/3 mutations in primary ILC of the breast associate with poor survival outcome in large public datasets. 
METHODS: We performed in silico comparison of ERBB2 non-amplified cases of ER+ stage I-III primary ILC (N=279) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC, N=1,301) using METABRIC, TCGA and MSK-IMPACT information. Activating mutations amenable to HER2-directed therapy with neratinib were identified using existing functional data from in vitro cell line and xenograft experiments. Multivariate analysis of 10-year overall survival (OS) with tumor size, grade and lymph node status was performed using a Cox regression model. Differential gene expression analyses by ERBB2 mutation and amplification status was performed using weighted average differences and an in-silico model of response to neratinib derived from breast cancer cell lines.
RESULTS: ILC tumors comprised 17.7% of all cases in the dataset but accounted for 47.1% of ERBB2-mutated cases. Mutations in ERBB2 were enriched in ILC versus IDC cases (5.7%, N=16 vs. 1.4%, N=18, p<0.0001) and clustered in the tyrosine kinase domain of HER2. ERBB3 mutations were not enriched in ILC (1.1%, N=3 vs. 1.8%, N=23; p=0.604). Median OS for patients with ERBB2-mutant ILC tumors was 66 months versus 211 months for ERBB2 wild-type (p=0.0001), and 159 vs. 166 months (p=0.733) for IDC tumors. Targetable ERBB2 mutational status was an independent prognostic marker of 10-year OS, but only in ILC (hazard ratio, HR=3.7, 95% CI 1.2-11.0; p=0.021). Findings were validated using a novel ERBB2 mutation gene enrichment score (HR for 10-year OS in ILC = 2.3, 95% CI 1.04-5.05; p=0.040).
CONCLUSIONS: Targetable ERBB2 mutations are enriched in primary ILC and their detection represents an actionable strategy with the potential to improve patient outcomes. Biomarker-led clinical trials of adjuvant HER-targeted therapy are warranted for patients with ERBB2-mutated primary HER2- ILC.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018622v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018622v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Oncology

"Genome-wide meta-analysis, fine-mapping, and integrative prioritization identify new Alzheimer's disease risk genes","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered numerous genomic loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the causal genes and variants remain incompletely identified. We performed an updated genome-wide AD meta-analysis, which identified 37 risk loci, including novel associations near genes CCDC6, TSPAN14, NCK2, and SPRED2. Using three SNP-level fine-mapping methods, we identified 21 SNPs with greater than 50% probability each of being causally involved in AD risk, and others strongly suggested by functional annotation. We followed this with colocalisation analyses across 109 gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets, and prioritization of genes using protein interaction networks and tissue-specific expression. Combining this information into a quantitative score, we find that evidence converges on likely causal genes, including the above four genes, and those at previously discovered AD loci including BIN1, APH1B, PTK2B, PILRA, and CASS4.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018424v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018424v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Unpublished clinical studies in pediatric emergence delirium - a cross sectional analysis","Objectives: Emergence delirium (ED) is a frequent and potentially serious complication of general anesthesia in children. Although there are various treatment strategies, no general management recommendations can be made. Selective reporting of study results may impair clinical decision making. We therefore analyzed whether the results of completed registered clinical studies in patients with pediatric ED are publically available or remain unpublished.
Design: cross sectional analysis
Setting: ClinicalTrials.gov and ClinicalTrialsRegister.eu
Participants and outcome measures: We determined the proportion of published and unpublished studies registered at ClinicalTrials.gov and ClinicalTrialsRegister.eu that were marked as completed by September 1st 2018. The major trial and literature databases were used to search for publications. In addition, the study investigators were contacted directly.
Results: Of the 44 registered studies on pediatric ED, only 24 (54%) have been published by September 2019. Published trials contained data from n=2556 patients, whereas n=1644 patients were enrolled in unpublished trials. Median time to publication was 19 months. Studies completed in recent years were published faster, but still only 9 of 25 trials were published within 12 months after completion.

"Genomic mapping identifies multiple therapeutic pathways in malignant mesothelioma","Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive malignancy associated with asbestos exposure. It shows limited responses to all treatments. Although 20% of tumours may transiently regress after checkpoint immunotherapy, predictors of response are unknown. The molecular landscape is of low complexity but recurrent lesions have not yet defined effective therapeutic targets.  In order to comprehensively map genomic alterations, we combined copy-number analysis from SNP arrays with targeted sequencing of tumours from 121 patients. We found previously unrecognised deletions in the tumour suppressor RB1 in 26% of cases. These combined with CDKN2A and TP53 lesions affected the RB tumour suppressor pathway in 65% of tumours. We show here therapeutic avenues downstream of RB1 by finding micromolar half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of PLK1, CHEK1 and Aurora Kinase inhibitors in MPM cell lines. Non-overlapping defects in Hippo pathways (RASSF7 amplification, NF2, LATS1 and LATS2 mutations) were present in 48% of tumours, accompanied by micromolar IC50s to the YAP1 inhibitor Verteporfin. Loss of a 240Kb locus containing SUFU was observed in 21% of tumours, accompanied by disordered expression of Hedgehog pathway genes. SUFU depletion was reproducibly associated with reduced transcription of T-cell and macrophage regulators, and increased transcription of the immune checkpoint inhibitor VISTA. In half of all MPM, CDKN2A deletions were accompanied by loss of Interferon Type I genes. The presence of dysregulated Hedgehog immune transcription and loss of Type I Interferons indicate novel approaches to immunotherapy.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018523v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018523v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Oncology

"Comparative Computed Tomography with Stress Manoeuvres for Diagnosing Distal Isolated Tibiofibular Syndesmotic Injury in Acute Ankle Sprain: a Protocol for an Accuracy-Test Prospective Study.","ABSTRACT
Introduction
Although there are several imaging options for diagnosing syndesmotic injury, a fundamental question that guides treatment remains unanswered. Syndesmotic instability is still challenging to correctly diagnose, and syndesmotic disruption and true syndesmotic instability should be differentiated. Currently, imaging tests quickly diagnose the severe syndesmotic instability but have difficulty in diagnosing mild and moderate cases. This study aims to investigate which strategy among an existing computed tomography (CT) index test and two new add-on CT index tests with stress manoeuvres can more accurately diagnose syndesmotic instability. The secondary objective is to investigate the participants disability outcomes by applying the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure questionnaire.
Methods and analyses
This diagnostic accuracy-test study will consecutively select individuals older than 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of suspected acute syndesmotic injury. Three strategies of the CT index test (one in the neutral position and two with stress) will examine the accuracy using magnetic resonance imaging as the reference standard. The external rotation and dorsiflexion of the ankle will guide the stress manoeuvres. Comparison measurements between the injured syndesmosis and the uninjured contralateral side of the same individual will investigate syndesmotic instability, evaluating the rotational and translational relationship between the fibula and tibia. Sensitivity, specificity, area under the ROC curve and likelihoods will compare the diagnostic accuracies of the strategies. 
Ethics and dissemination
The Internal Review Board and the Research Ethics Committee approved this study (registered number 62100016.5.0000.0071). All the participants will receive a spoken description of the aim of the study, and the choice to participate will be free and voluntary. Participants enrolment will occur after signing the written informed consent, including the terms of confidentiality. The results will be presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals and social media.
Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT04095598), pre-results.

Strengths and limitations of this study

This study is the first to examine the accuracy and feasibility of CT with stress manoeuvres for diagnosing syndesmotic instability. 
The disability outcomes will be used to evaluate syndesmotic instability diagnosed by CT with stress manoeuvres as a prognostic factor.
The limitations of this study include the use of MRI as the reference standard test, which, although not perfect, is estimated to have high accuracy compared to the gold-standard arthroscopy.1 
An inherent degree of imprecision related to the severity of the ankle sprain and pain exacerbation may occur when the participants themselves control stress manoeuvres; therefore, some variability is unavoidable. Researchers will monitor and investigate the influence of this source of variability on the results.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018515v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018515v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Radiology and Imaging

"Integrated single cell analysis of human lung fibrosis resolves cellular origins of predictive protein signatures in body fluids","Single cell genomics enables characterization of disease specific cell states, while improvements in mass spectrometry workflows bring the clinical use of body fluid proteomics within reach. The correspondence of cell state changes in diseased organs to peripheral protein signatures is currently unknown. Here, we leverage single cell RNA-seq and proteomic analysis of large pulmonary fibrosis patient cohorts to identify disease specific changes on the cellular level and their corresponding reflection in body fluid proteomes. We discovered and validated transcriptional changes in 45 cell types across three patient cohorts that translated into distinct changes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma proteome. These protein signatures correlated with diagnosis, lung function, smoking and injury status. Specifically, the altered expression of a novel marker of lung health, CRTAC1, in alveolar epithelium is robustly reflected in patient plasma. Our findings have direct implications for future non-invasive prediction and monitoring of pathological cell state changes in patient organs.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20018358v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20018358v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Respiratory Medicine

"Bayesian hierarchical modeling of joint spatiotemporal risk patterns for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Tuberculosis (TB) in Kenya","The spatiotemporal modeling of multiple diseases simultaneously is a recent extension that advances the space-time analysis to model multiple related diseases simultaneously. This approach strengthens inferences by borrowing information between related diseases. Numerous research contributions to spatiotemporal modeling approaches exhibit their strengths differently with increasing complexity. However, contributions that combine spatiotemporal approaches to modeling of multiple diseases simultaneously are not so common. We present a full Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal approach to the joint modeling of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Tuberculosis incidences in Kenya. Using case notification data for the period 2012 - 2017, we estimated the model parameters and determined the joint spatial patterns and temporal variations. Our model included specific and shared spatial and temporal effects. The specific random effects allowed for departures from the shared patterns for the different diseases. The space-time interaction term characterized the underlying spatial patterns with every temporal fluctuation. We assumed the shared random effects to be the structured effects and the disease-specific random effects to be unstructured effects. We detected the spatial congruence in the distribution of Tuberculosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus in approximately 29 counties around the western, central and southern regions of Kenya. The distribution of the shared relative risks had minimal difference with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus disease-specific relative risk whereas that of Tuberculosis presented many more counties as high-risk areas. The flexibility and informative outputs of Bayesian Hierarchical Models enabled us to identify the similarities and differences in the distribution of the relative risks associated with each disease. Estimating the Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Tuberculosis shared relative risks provide additional insights towards collaborative monitoring of the diseases and control efforts.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018390v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018390v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","HIV/AIDS

"The cholinergic system and treatment response in subtypes of Alzheimer's disease","BACKGROUND: The heterogeneity within Alzheimer's disease (AD) seriously challenges the development of disease modifying treatments. We investigated volume of the basal forebrain, hippocampus, and precuneus in atrophy subtypes of AD, and explored the relevance of subtype stratification in a clinical trial on encapsulated cell biodelivery (ECB) of nerve growth factor (NGF) to the basal forebrain. METHODS: Structural MRI data was collected for 90 amyloid-positive patients and 69 amyloid-negative healthy controls at baseline, 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up. The effect of the NGF treatment was investigated in 10 biopsy verified AD patients with structural MRI data at baseline and at 6- or 12-months follow-up. Patients were classified as typical, limbic-predominant, hippocampal-sparing, or minimal atrophy AD, using a validated visual assessment method. Volumetric analyses were performed using a region-of-interest approach. RESULTS: All AD subtypes showed reduced basal forebrain volume as compared with controls. Limbic-predominant subtype showed fastest basal forebrain atrophy rate, whereas minimal atrophy subtype did not show significant volume decline over time. Atrophy rates of hippocampus and precuneus also differed across subtypes. The NGF treatment seemed to slow the rate of atrophy in precuneus and hippocampus, particularly in the hippocampal-sparing AD subtype. CONCLUSIONS: The cholinergic system is differentially affected in distinct atrophy subtypes of AD, possibly contributing to their differential response to cholinergic treatment. Our findings suggest that future clinical trials should target specific subtypes of AD, or at least report treatment effects stratifying by subtype.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018507v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018507v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Radiology and Imaging

"Perceived facilitators and barriers among physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons to pre-operative home-based exercise with one exercise-only in patients with severe knee osteoarthritis: A qualitative interview study nested in the QUADX-1 trial","Aim
Clinical guidelines recommend non-surgical treatment before surgery is considered in patients eligible for knee replacement (KR). Surgical treatment is provided by orthopedic surgeons and exercise therapy is provided by physical therapists. This study aimed to investigate key stakeholder perspectives on pre-operative, home-based exercise therapy with one exercise-only in patients eligible for KR.
Methods
This qualitative study is embedded within the QUADX-1 randomized trial that investigates a model of coordinated non-surgical and surgical treatment for patients eligible for KR. Physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons working with patients with knee osteoarthritis in their daily clinical work were interviewed (one focus group and four single interviews) to explore their perceived facilitators and barriers related to pre-operative home-based exercise therapy with one exercise-only in patients eligible for KR. Interviews were analyzed using content analysis.
Results
From the content analysis three main themes emerged: 1) Physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons ambivalence in their professional roles, 2) Orthopedic surgeons view on exercise, and 3) Coordinated non-surgical and surgical care. 
Conclusion
We found that the pre-operative exercise intervention created ambivalence in the professional role of both the physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons. The physical therapists were skeptical towards over-simplified exercise therapy. The orthopedic surgeons were skeptical towards the potential lack of (long-term) effect of exercise therapy in patients eligible for KR. The consequence of these barriers and ambivalence in the professional role is important to consider when planning implementation of the model of coordinated non-surgical and surgical treatment.

"Classification and prediction of frontotemporal dementia based on plasma microRNAs","Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by frontal and temporal lobe atrophy, typically manifesting with behavioural or language impairment. Because of its heterogeneity and lack of available diagnostic laboratory tests there can be a substantial delay in diagnosis. Cell-free, circulating, microRNAs are increasingly investigated as biomarkers for neurodegeneration, but their value in FTD is not yet established.  In this study, we investigate microRNAs as biomarkers for FTD diagnosis. We performed next generation small RNA sequencing on cell-free plasma from 52 FTD cases and 21 controls.  The analysis revealed the diagnostic importance of 20 circulating endogenous miRNAs in distinguishing FTD cases from controls. The study was repeated in an independent second cohort of 117 FTD cases and 35 controls. The combinatorial microRNA signature from the first cohort, precisely diagnosed FTD samples in a second cohort. To further increase the generalizability of the prediction, we implemented machine learning techniques in a merged dataset of the two cohorts, which resulted in a comparable or improved classification precision with a smaller panel of miRNA classifiers. In addition, there are intriguing molecular commonalities with cell free miRNA signature in ALS, a motor neuron disease that resides on a pathological continuum with FTD. However, the signature that describes the ALS-FTD spectrum is not shared with blood miRNA profiles of patients with multiple sclerosis. Thus, microRNAs are promising FTD biomarkers that might enable earlier detection of FTD and improve accurate identification of patients for clinical trials","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018408v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018408v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Neurology

"Pilot study demonstrating changes in DNA hydroxymethylation enable detection of multiple cancers in plasma cell-free DNA","Our study employed the detection of 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5hmC) profiles on cell free DNA (cfDNA) from the plasma of cancer patients using a novel enrichment technology coupled with sequencing and machine learning based classification method. These classification methods were develo ped to detect the presence of disease in the plasma of cancer and control subjects. Cancer and control patient cfDNA cohorts were accrued from multiple sites consisting of 48 breast, 55 lung, 32 prostate and 53 pancreatic cancer subjects. In addition, a control cohort of 180  subjects (non-cancer) was employed to match cancer patient demographics (age, sex and smoking status) in a case-control study design. Logistic regression methods applied to each cancer case cohort individually, with a balancing non-cancer cohort, were able to classify cancer and control samples with measurably high performance.  Measures of predictive performance by using 5-fold cross validation coupled with out-of-fold area under the curve (AUC) measures were established for breast, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancer to be 0.89, 0.84, 0.95 and 0.83 respectively. The genes defining each of these predictive models were enriched for pathways relevant to disease specific etiology, notably in the control of gene regulation in these same pathways. The breast cancer cohort consisted primarily of stage I and II patients, including tumors < 2 cm and these samples exhibited a high cancer probability score. This suggests that the 5hmC derived classification methodology may yield epigenomic detection of early stage disease in plasma. Same observation was made for the pancreatic dataset where >50% of cancers were stage I and II and showed the highest cancer probability score.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018382v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018382v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Global DNA hypomethylation in epithelial ovarian cancer: passive demethylation and association with genomic instability","A hallmark of human cancer is global DNA hypomethylation (GDHO), but the mechanisms accounting for this defect and its pathological consequences are ill-defined. In human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), GDHO was associated with advanced disease and reduced overall and disease-free survival. GDHO(+) EOC was enriched for a proliferative gene expression signature, including FOXM1 activation. DNA hypomethylation preferentially occurred within genomic blocks (hypo blocks) overlapping late-replicating, lamina-associated domains, PRC2 binding, and H3K27me3. Increased proliferation coupled with hypo block formation at late replicating regions suggested passive hypomethylation, which was further supported by the observation that cytosine DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and UHRF1 showed significantly reduced expression in GDHO(+) EOC, after normalization to proliferation markers. Importantly, GDHO(+) EOC showed elevated chromosomal instability (CIN), and copy number alterations (CNA) were enriched at hypo blocks. Together, these findings implicate a passive demethylation mechanism for GDHO that promotes genomic instability and poor prognosis in EOC.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018374v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018374v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Oncology

"Neural stimulation and recording performance in human somatosensory cortex over 1500 days","Objective: Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in somatosensory cortex can restore sensation to people who have lost it due to spinal cord injury or other conditions. One potential challenge for chronic ICMS is whether neural recording and stimulation can remain stable over many years. This is particularly relevant since the recording quality of implanted microelectrode arrays frequently experience degradation over time and stimulation safety has been considered a potential barrier to the clinical use of ICMS. Our objective is to evaluate stability of recordings on intracortical stimulated and non-stimulated electrodes in a human participant across a long period of implantation. Additionally, we would like to assess the ability to evoke sensations with ICMS over time.

Approach: In a study investigating intracortical implants for a bidirectional brain-computer interface, we implanted microelectrode arrays with sputtered iridium oxide tips in the somatosensory cortex of a human participant with a cervical spinal cord injury. We regularly stimulated through electrodes on these microelectrode arrays to evoke tactile sensations on the hand. Here, we quantify the stability of these electrodes in comparison to non-stimulated electrodes implanted in motor cortex over 1500 days in two ways: recorded signal quality and electrode impedances. Additionally, we quantify the perceptual stability of ICMS-evoked sensations with detection thresholds.

Main results: We found that recording quality, as assessed by the number of electrodes with high-amplitude waveform recordings (> 100 V), peak-to-peak voltage, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio, generally decreased over time on stimulated and non-stimulated electrodes. However, stimulated electrodes were much more likely to continue to record high-amplitude signals than non-stimulated electrodes. Interestingly, the detection thresholds for stimulus-evoked tactile sensations decreased over time from a median of 31.5 A at Day 100 to 10.4 A at Day 1500, with the most substantial changes occurring between Day 100 and Day 500.

Significance: These results provide evidence that ICMS in human somatosensory cortex can be provided over long periods of time without deleterious effects on recording or stimulation capabilities. In fact, psychophysical sensitivity to stimulation improves over time and stimulation itself may promote more robust long-term neural recordings.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20018341v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20018341v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Neurology

"Normative reference values of the handgrip strength for the Portuguese workers.","Aims: Thus, this study aims to identify the normative values of handgrip strength for Portuguese workers in the automotive industry. Methods: About 1225 employees were invited to participate in the study. The final sample consisted of 656 employees in the assembly area. The handgrip strength was measured in kilograms (kg) using the Jamar digital dynamometer. Two measurements were performed in both hands, totaling four measurements. For the present study, the maximum value was recorded regardless of the hand. Results: showed the peak mean values of handgrip strength in the group of women was 34 kg in the age group of 35-39 years, and the group of men the peak mean was 52 kg in the age group of 25-34 years. The most pronounced decline in the female group appears in the age of 30-34 years with 30 kg and the men group the decline occurs of 2kg below the peak force, in the age group between the 40-57 years. This study used a cut-off at 2 SD below by the sex-specific peak mean. Conclusion: Normative values can help delineate the career path of workers because they portray risk values according to age, height, and gender. And they can also help in adjusting the morphological and strength characteristics of the worker with the task to be performed, as an example of work above head level.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20018333v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20018333v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Occupational and Environmental Health

"A prospective evaluation of inter-rater agreement of routine medical records audits at a large general hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil.","Objectives: To evaluate the inter-rater agreement (IRA) among members of the Patient's Health Record Review Board (PHRRB), in routine auditing of medical records, and the impact of periodic discussions of results with raters.
Design: Prospective longitudinal study conducted between July of 2015 and April of 2016.
Setting: Hospital Municipal Dr. Moyses Deutsch, a large public hospital in Sao Paulo. 
Participants: The PHRRB was composed of 12 physicians, 9 nurses and 3 physiotherapists, who audited medical records, monthly, with the number of raters changing throughout the study.
Interventions: It was carried out PHRRB meetings in order to reach a consensus on criteria that the members have to rate in the auditing process. It was created a review chart that raters should verify the registry of patient's secondary diagnosis, chief complaint, history of presenting complaint, past medical history, medication history, physical exam and diagnostic testing. It was obtained the IRA every three months. 
Measures: The Gwet's AC1 coefficient and Proportion of Agreement (PA) were calculated to evaluate the IRA for each item over time. 
Results: The study included 1884 items from 239 records with an overall full agreement among raters of 71.2%. A significant IRA increase by 16.5% (OR=1.17; 95% CI=1.03-1.32; p=0.014) was found in the routine PHRRB auditing, with no significant differences between the PA and the Gwet's AC1, that showed a similar evolution over time. The PA decreased by 27.1% when at least one of the raters was absent from the review meeting (OR=0.73; 95% CI=0.53-1.00; p=0.048).
Conclusions: Medical record quality has been associated with the quality of care and could be optimized and improved by targeted interventions. The PA and the Gwet's AC1 are suitable agreement coefficients that are feasible to be incorporated in the routine of PHRRB evaluation process.

"Epidemiology of Epstein-Barr Virus infection and Infectious Mononucleosis in the United Kingdom","Background:
Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous gamma-herpesvirus with which ~95% of the healthy population is infected. EBV infection has been implicated in a range of haematological malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Delayed primary EBV infection increases the risk of subsequent complications. Over recent decades, the age of primary EBV infection has become later, largely due to improved sanitation and living conditions. 
Methods and findings:
First, we conducted a seroepidemiological survey of healthy volunteers between 0 and 25 years old to assess prevalence of detectable anti EBV antibodies. 1982 of 2325 individuals (85.3%) were EBV seropositive. EBV seropositivity increased monotonically with age, and increased more among females than males during adolescence (ages 10 to 15). Second, we conducted a retrospective review of Hospital Episode Statistics to determine changes in Infectious Mononucleosis (IM) incidence over time. Between 2002 and 2013, the incidence of IM (derived from hospital admissions data) increased.  We then conducted a large case-control study of 6306 prevalent IM cases and 1,009,971 unmatched controls extracted from an East London GP database to determine exposures associated with IM. Exposures associated with lower risk of IM were elevated BMI (Overweight OR 0.80 [0.75 to 0.86], obese OR 0.63 [0.57 to 0.70]), non-white ethnicity (Black OR 0.21 [0.18 to 0.23], Asian OR 0.14 [0.13 to 0.16], Other ethnicity OR 0.22 [0.19 to 0.25]), and a history of smoking (OR 0.87 [0.83 to 0.92]), whereas affluence was associated with a higher risk of IM (per increase in IMD decile OR 1.15 [1.13 to 1.17]. Finally, we used ELISA to determine antibody responses to common pathogens and vaccine antigens among EBV seronegative individuals. EBV seronegative donors did not display diminished serum antibody responses to pertussis, rubella, or varicella  compared to EBV seropositive donors.
Conclusions:
In this study we make several important observations on the epidemiology of EBV infection in the UK. We find that overall EBV seroprevalence in the UK appears to have increased, and that the sharp increase in EBV seropositivity takes places earlier among females than males. We find that the incidence of IM requiring hospitalisation is increasing. We find that exposures associated with prevalent IM in a diverse population include white ethnicity, affluence, lower BMI, and never-smoking, and these exposures interact with each other. Lastly, we provide pilot evidence suggesting that antibody responses to vaccine and encountered pathogens do not seem to be diminished among EBV seronegative individuals, which is a theoretical counter-argument to developing EBV vaccines. Our findings could help to inform vaccine study designs in efforts to prevent IM and late complications of EBV infection, such as Multiple Sclerosis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20018317v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20018317v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Epidemiology

"Temporal Trends in Vaping Use: Demographic Diversity and Healthcare Utilization Outcomes","BACKGROUND:  Use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has increased substantially in recent years. Marketed as a safer alternative to conventional tobacco cigarettes, the safety profile of e-cigarettes is now being questioned. Importantly, the clinical consequences of e-cigarette use remain poorly characterized.
METHODS: Using data from the electronic health record (EHR), we identified a cohort of e-cigarette users and never-smokers in the region of central Los Angeles. Using information extracted from the EHR, we assessed temporal trends in the demographic characteristics of e-cigarette users, including race/ethnicity and location of residence. We also used data on urgent medical visits (i.e. emergency department encounters and hospital admissions) occurring during the study period (January 2014 to January 2020) and employed a negative binomial regression model to compare healthcare utilization rates between e-cigarette users and never-smokers.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 698 e-cigarette users, in addition to 999 never-smokers, with demographic, clinical, and outcomes data available over the duration of the study period. From the beginning to the end of the study period, e-cigarette use increased across all race/ethnicity groups and across all geographic regions of residence. Notably, e-cigarette users experienced a 4.96 higher rate of urgent medical visits when compared to never-smokers evaluated over the same study period.
CONCLUSION: E-cigarettes use continues to expand, with evidence of racial/ethnic as well as geographic variation in uptake. Use of e-cigarette devices is associated with substantially higher rates of urgent healthcare utilization. These findings highlight the need for a more granular understanding of e-cigarette use and enhanced attention to the diversity as well as breadth of the population affected by this burgeoning health crisis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.20018275v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.20018275v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Epidemiology

"Healthcare Cost of Stargardt Disease","Importance: Stargardt disease (SD) is the most common juvenile macular degeneration and a leading cause of uncorrectable childhood blindness. The progressive and incurable nature of this chronic condition entails a long-term financial burden on affected individuals. The economic costs of SD have not been characterized in detail.
Objective: To estimate the direct healthcare cost of SD.
Design: Cross-sectional analysis of healthcare claims. 
Participants: Patients with an ICD-9 diagnosis code of SD, non-exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD), or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SHL).
Methods: Outpatient administrative claims data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database from 2010 to 2014 were analyzed.
Main Outcome Measure: Annual per-patient direct healthcare cost.
Results: A total of 472,428 patients were analyzed (5,015 SD, 369,750 SHL and 97,663 AMD patients respectively). The payment per year of insurance coverage for SD (median: $105.58, IQR: $50.53-$218.71) was higher than that of SHL (median: $51.01, IQR: $25.66-$121.66, p<0.001) and AMD (median: $76.20, IQR: $38.00-$164.86, p<0.001). When adjusted for covariates, the annual payment for SD was $47.83 higher than SHL (p<0.001) and $17.34 higher than AMD (p<0.001). 
Conclusions and Relevance: There is a significant direct healthcare cost associated with SD. The annual per-patient cost of SD was higher than SHL, another condition that causes sensory impairment in people of all ages, and nonexudative AMD which causes a similar pattern of visual loss that typically begins later in life. The total lifetime per-patient cost of SD may exceed that of nonexudative AMD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20017962v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20017962v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Ophthalmology

"Early signs of disrupted rule learning in adolescents at clinical high risk for psychosis","Background: The ability to flexibly apply rules to novel situations is a critical aspect of adaptive human behavior. Evidence from traditional neuropsychological tests suggest that broad executive function deficits appear early in the course of psychosis, but it is unclear which specific facets are affected. Identifying whether rule learning is impacted at the early stages of psychosis are necessary for truly understanding the etiology of psychosis and may be critical for designing novel treatments. Therefore, we examined rule learning in healthy adolescents and those meeting criteria for clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. 


Methods: 24 control and 22 CHR adolescents underwent rapid, high-resolution fMRI while performing a paradigm which required them to apply novel or practiced task rules.

Results: Previous work with this task has suggested that practiced rules rely on rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) during task preparation and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during  task performance, while novel rules showed the opposite pattern. In controls, we partially replicated this finding with a small effect of greater activity in RLPFC for practiced versus novel tasks; however, the CHR group showed a dysfunctional pattern of results. Not only did the CHR group show alternations in the expected brain dynamics, but they showed weaker effects than controls during both task preparation and task performance. 

Conclusions: These findings suggest that the critical ability to flexibly apply abstract rules is already disrupted at the clinical high risk stage of psychosis. However, more data is needed to determine whether these deficits predict disease progression.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.20018069v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.20018069v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Family Presence and Audience Effects on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: Perceptions of Pre-hospital Emergency Caregivers in Turkey","Background: There have been many studies regarding family presence during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and most of them are about emergency services or intensive care units. However, the issue has not been studied enough in terms of pre-hospital emergency medicine and the perspective of pre-hospital emergency caregivers. 
Aim: In this study, it is aimed to present the perceptions and attitudes of a group of pre-hospital emergency care professionals to family presence during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
Method: The data for this descriptive research was collected between March-May 2015. The participants were 63 pre-hospital healthcares from a small city, Afyonkarahisar. The data was collected using a questionnaire and the responses summarized by using frequencies and percentages. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and each of the survey items.
Findings: Of the respondents, for demographic findings of each groups by highest rates; 38 (60.32%) were male, 31 (49.21%) were paramedics and 37 (58.73%) were 1-3 years work experienced. 65.07% were strongly opposed to the family presence during CPR. Among the total sample, 71.41% of participants did not agree with that the presence of press members positively affects their performance. 
Conclusion: The presence of significant others during CPR affects pre-hospital emergency caregivers negatively. Disturbing effect on caregivers is related not only to the presence of family members or to other significant others but also related to the press and audience. Family presence causes health professionals to experience performance anxiety. Family presence and the audience effect are crucial issues that need more attention in pre-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20017988v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20017988v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Medical Ethics

In the past decade, several studies have suggested that carrying a single heterozygous PINK1 mutation is associated with increased risk for Parkinson's disease. Here we comprehensively assess the role of PINK1 variants in Parkinson's disease susceptibility using several large datasets totalling 376,558 individuals including: 13,708 Parkinson's disease cases and 362,850 controls. After combining these data, we did not find evidence to support a role for heterozygous PINK1 mutations as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20018101v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.20018101v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Combined vitrectomy, near-confluent endolaser, bevacizumab and cyclophotocoagulation for neovascular glaucoma","Purpose: Evaluated the safety and efficacy of an integrative surgical approach to neovascular glaucoma (NVG).
Methods: Consecutive interventional case series of NVG with one-year follow-up. Eyes underwent pars plana vitrectomy, near-confluent panretinal photocoagulation, intravitreal bevacizumab, and transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. Phakic eyes underwent concomitant cataract surgery. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA, logMAR), intraocular pressure (IOP, mmHg), glaucoma medication score (GMS), visual analog pain scale (VAPS, 0-10) were recorded at baseline, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Blind eyes were excluded.
Results: 83 eyes of 83 patients (53 male, 30 female, mean age 74.6+-11.6 years) were included and 53 completed a one-year follow-up. NVG underlying conditions included retinal vein occlusion (n=41), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (n=25), central retinal artery occlusion (n=10), and ocular ischemic syndrome (n=6). Mean IOP decreased postoperatively from 46.0+-10.3 mmHg to 14.2+-8.9 mmHg (p<0.001), GMS from 4.8 to 1.8 (p<0.001) and VAPS from 6 to 0. BCVA was unchanged. All postoperative complications had resolved at 1 month postop. 26 eyes did not require additional surgical treatment during follow-up.
Conclusions: A single, comprehensive surgery session was able to significantly lower IOP, reduce GMS and control pain.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.19.20017889v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.19.20017889v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Ophthalmology

"Large mosaic copy number variations confer autism risk","Although germline de novo copy number variants are a known cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the contribution of mosaic (early-developmental) copy number variants (mCNVs) has not been explored. Here, we assessed the contribution of mCNVs to ASD by ascertaining mCNVs in genotype array intensity data from 12,077 ASD probands and 5,500 unaffected siblings in the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) and Simons Powering Autism Research for Knowledge (SPARK) cohorts. We detected 46 mCNVs in probands and 19 mCNVs in siblings ranging from 49 kb to 249 Mb and affecting 2.8-73.8% of cells. In both cohorts, probands carried a significant burden of large (>4 Mb) mCNVs (P = 0.043 and P = 6.6 x 10-3 in SSC and SPARK, respectively), which were present in a total of 25 probands but only 1 sibling (OR=11.4, 95% CI=1.5-84.2). Surprisingly, we did not observe mosaic analogues of the short de novo CNVs recurrently observed in ASD. Event size positively correlated with severity of ASD symptoms (P = 0.016), and four probands exhibited clinical symptoms consistent with syndromes previously associated with genes or regions disrupted by their respective mosaic mutations. In analyses of post-mortem brain tissue from 60 additional probands, we further detected and experimentally validated two mCNVs including a complex 10.3 Mb duplication on chromosome 2. These results indicate that mosaic CNVs contribute a previously unexplained component of ASD risk.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20017624v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20017624v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"To pool or not to pool samples for Sexually Transmitted Infections detection in Men who have Sex with Men? An evaluation of a novel pooling method using the GeneXpert instrument in West-Africa (CohMSM-PrEP ANRS 12369  Expertise France).","Background: Men who have sex with Men (MSM) using Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are at risk for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). Therefore, PrEP services should include regular screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) at urethra, anorectum and pharynx. However, financial and logistic challenges arise in low resource settings. We assessed a novel STI sample pooling method using the GeneXpert instrument among MSM initiating PrEP in West-Africa. 
Methods: Urine, anorectal and pharyngeal samples were pooled per individual for analysis. Unpooled samples were analyzed in case of an invalid or positive result of the pool, to identify the infection his biological location. The results of two different pooling strategies were compared against a gold standard. 
Results: We found a prevalence of 14.5% for chlamydia and 11.5% for gonorrhea, with a predominance of infections being extra-genital (77.6%). The majority of infections were asymptomatic (88.2%). The pooling strategy with unpooling of invalid results only, had a sensitivity, specificity and agreement for CT of 95.4%, 98.7% and 0.93, respectively; and 92.3%, 99.2% and 0.93 with additional unpooling of positive results. For NG, these figures were 88.9%, 97.7% and 0.85 for testing of invalid results, and 88.9%, 96.7% and 0.81 with unpooling of positive results.
Conclusion: West-African MSM have a high prevalence of extra-genital and asymptomatic STIs. The GeneXpert method provides an opportunity to move from syndromic towards etiological STI diagnosis in low income countries, as the platform is available in all African countries for tuberculosis testing. Pooling will reduce costs of triple site testing.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20017392v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20017392v1.full.pdf","2020-01-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"STK11 and KEAP1 Mutations as Prognostic Biomarkers in an Observational Real-World Lung Adenocarcinoma Cohort","Importance: Understanding the mechanisms of primary resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy is of paramount importance for treatment selection. Somatic mutations in STK11 and KEAP1, frequently co-mutated in nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, have been associated with poor response to immune checkpoint blockade. However, previous reports lack non-immune checkpoint blockade controls needed to properly ascertain the predictive nature of those biomarkers. Objective: To evaluate the predictive vs prognostic effect of STK11 or KEAP1 mutations across different treatment classes in nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. Design: A retrospective, real-world data cohort from the Flatiron Health network linked with genetic testing from Foundation Medicine, from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2018. Setting: Multicenter, including academic and community practices. Participants: Patients diagnosed with stage IIIB, IIIC, IVA, or IVB nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer who initiated first-line treatment within 90 days after diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Real-world, progression-free survival and overall survival calculated from time of initiation of first-line treatment. Results: We analyzed clinical and mutational data for 2276 patients with advanced, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (mean age at advanced diagnosis, 66.3 years [SD 10.3], 54.4% female, 80.1% with a history of smoking), including patients treated with anti-programmed death-1/anti-programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors at first line (n = 574).

"Classification and prediction of frontotemporal dementia based on plasma microRNAs","Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by frontal and temporal lobe atrophy, typically manifesting with behavioural or language impairment. Because of its heterogeneity and lack of available diagnostic laboratory tests there can be a substantial delay in diagnosis. Cell-free, circulating, microRNAs are increasingly investigated as biomarkers for neurodegeneration, but their value in FTD is not yet established.  In this study, we investigate microRNAs as biomarkers for FTD diagnosis. We performed next generation small RNA sequencing on cell-free plasma from 52 FTD cases and 21 controls.  The analysis revealed the diagnostic importance of 20 circulating endogenous miRNAs in distinguishing FTD cases from controls. The study was repeated in an independent second cohort of 117 FTD cases and 35 controls. The combinatorial microRNA signature from the first cohort, precisely diagnosed FTD samples in a second cohort. To further increase the generalizability of the prediction, we implemented machine learning techniques in a merged dataset of the two cohorts, which resulted in a comparable or improved classification precision with a smaller panel of miRNA classifiers. In addition, there are intriguing molecular commonalities with cell free miRNA signature in ALS, a motor neuron disease that resides on a pathological continuum with FTD. However, the signature that describes the ALS-FTD spectrum is not shared with blood miRNA profiles of patients with multiple sclerosis. Thus, microRNAs are promising FTD biomarkers that might enable earlier detection of FTD and improve accurate identification of patients for clinical trials","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018408v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018408v2.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Neurology

"Enhanced Recovery after Intensive Care (ERIC): study protocol for a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a critical care telehealth program on process quality and functional outcomes","Introduction 
Survival after critical illness has noticeably improved over the last decades due to advances in critical care medicine. Besides, there are an increasing number of elderly patients with chronic diseases being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). More than half of the survivors of critical illness suffer from medium- or long-term cognitive, psychological and/or physical impairments after ICU discharge, which is recognized as post intensive care syndrome (PICS). There are evidence- and consensus-based quality indicators (QIs) in intensive care medicine, which have a positive influence on patients' long-term outcomes if adhered to. 
Methods and analysis 
The protocol of a multicentre, pragmatic, stepped wedge cluster-randomized controlled, quality improvement trial is presented. During three predefined steps, 12 academic hospitals in Berlin and Brandenburg, Germany, are randomly selected to move in a 1-way crossover from the control to the intervention condition. After a multifactorial training programme on QIs and clinical outcomes for site personnel ICUs will receive an adapted, interprofessional protocol for a complex telehealth intervention comprising of daily telemedical rounds at ICU. The targeted sample size is 1431 patients. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on the adherence to 8 QIs daily measured during the patient's ICU stay, compared to standard of care. Furthermore, the impact on long-term recovery such as PICS-related patient-centred outcomes including health-related quality-of-life, mental health, clinical assessments of cognition and physical function, all-cause mortality, and cost-effectiveness 3 and 6 months after ICU discharge will be evaluated. 
Ethics and dissemination
This protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Charit Universittsmedizin, Berlin, Germany (EA1/006/18). The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences. Study findings will also be disseminated via the website (https://www.eric-projekt.de).

"DNA methylation derived immune cell profiles, CpG markers of inflammation, and pancreatic cancer risk","Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second most common cause of cancer death over the next 5 years. Since inflammation is thought to be a common trajectory for disease initiation, we sought to prospectively characterize immune profiles using DNA methylation markers to examine whether they play a key role in pancreatic cancer risk. In a nested case-control study pooling three U.S. prospective cohort studies, DNA methylation was measured in prediagnostic leukocytes of incident pancreatic cancer cases and matched controls using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. Differentially methylated regions were used to predict immune cell types and CpGs previously associated with blood inflammatory markers were selected for the analysis. DNA methylation data from a retrospective case-control study conducted in Spain (PanGenEU) was used for independent replication of results. Immune cell proportions and ratio of cell proportions were not associated with pancreatic cancer risk in the nested case-control study. Methylation extent of CpGs residing in or near gene MNDA was significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk in the nested case-control study and replicated in PanGenEU. In the nested case-control study, the associations were present 10 or more years prior to cancer diagnosis. Methylation of a promoter CpG of gene PIM-1 was associated with pancreatic cancer survival in both studies. We identified several CpGs that may play a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis using a targeted approach for the selection of inflammation-based CpGs in two large, independent studies conducted in different countries with distinct study designs.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20019034v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20019034v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Epidemiology

"Clinical predictors for etiology of acute diarrhea in children in resource-limited settings","Background. Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in lower- and middle-income countries. In such settings, access to laboratory diagnostics are often limited, and decisions for use of antimicrobials often empiric. Clinical predictors are a potential non-laboratory method to more accurately assess diarrheal etiology, the knowledge of which could improve management of pediatric diarrhea.
Methods. We used clinical and quantitative molecular etiologic data from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a prospective, case-control study, to develop predictive models for the etiology of diarrhea. Using random forests, we screened the available variables and then assessed the performance of predictions from random forest regression models and logistic regression models using 5-fold cross-validation.
Results. We identified 1049 cases where a virus was the only etiology, and developed predictive models against 2317 cases where the etiology was known but non-viral (bacterial, protozoal, or mixed). Variables predictive of a viral etiology included age, season, height-for-age z-score (HAZ), bloody diarrhea, and vomiting. Cross-validation suggests an AUC of 0.825 can be achieved with a parsimonious model of 5 variables, achieving a specificity of 0.85, a sensitivity of 0.59, a NPV of 0.82 and a PPV of 0.64.
Conclusion. Predictors of the etiology of pediatric diarrhea can be used by providers in low-resources setting to inform clinical decision-making. The use of non-laboratory methods to diagnose viral causes of diarrhea could reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescription worldwide.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20016725v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20016725v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Public and Global Health

"A Pilot Study of an Esophageal Cooling Device During Radiofrequency Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation","Background: Esophageal thermal injury is a risk of ablation of the posterior left atrium despite various devices utilized to date.  

Objective: Evaluate the potential of a commercially-available esophageal cooling device to provide esophageal protection during left atrial catheter ablation. 

Methods: In this pilot study, we randomized 6 patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.  Three patients received standard of care for our site (use of a single-sensor temperature probe, with adjunct iced-water instillation for any temperature increases >1C).  Three patients received standard ablation after placement of the esophageal cooling device using a circulating water temperature of 4C.  All patients underwent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on the day prior to ablation followed by EGD on the day after. 

Results: In the 3 control patients, one had no evidence of esophageal mucosal damage, one had diffuse sloughing of the esophageal mucosa and multiple ulcerations, and one had a superficial ulcer with large clot.  Both patients with lesions were classified as Zargar 2a.  In the 3 patients treated with the cooling device, one had no evidence of esophageal mucosal damage, one had esophageal erythema (Zargar 1), and one had a solitary Zargar 2a lesion.  At 3-month follow-up, 1 patient in each group had recurrence of atrial fibrillation.

Conclusions: The extent of esophageal injury was less severe with a commercially available esophageal cooling device than with reactive instillation of ice-cold water.

"Which came first, obstructive sleep apnea or hypertension? A retrospective study of electronic records over 10 years, with separation by sex","Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for hypertension (HTN), but the clinical progression of the sleep disorder to the high blood pressure condition is unclear. There are also sex differences in prevalence, screening and symptoms of OSA. The objective was to estimate the time from OSA to HTN diagnoses, with sex-specific quantification. 
Design: Retrospective analysis of electronic health records (EHR) over a 10-year period (2006 to 2015 inclusive).
Setting: UCLA Health System in Los Angeles, California, USA.
Participants: 4848 patients: female N=2086, mean [agestd] = 52.813.2 years; male N=2762, age=53.813.5 years. These patients were selected from 1.6 million patients with diagnoses in the EHR who met the criteria of: diagnoses of OSA and HTN; in long-term care defined by ambulatory visits at least one year prior and one year subsequent to the first OSA diagnosis; no diagnosis of OSA or HTN at intake; and a sleep study performed at UCLA. 
Primary and secondary outcome measures: The primary outcome measure in each patient was time from the first diagnosis of OSA to the first diagnosis of HTN (in days). Since HTN and OSA are progressive disorders, a secondary measure was relationship between OSA-to-HTN time and age.
Results: The mean, std and 95% confidence intervals of the time from OSA to HTN diagnoses were: all -732  1094.9 [-764.6, -701.8] days; female -815.9  1127.3 [-867.3, -764.2] days; and male -668.6  1065.6 [-708.1, -626.8] days. Age was negatively related to time from OSA to HTN diagnosis in both sexes.
Conclusions: HTN was on average diagnosed years prior to OSA, with a longer separation in females. Our findings suggest under-screening of OSA, more so in females than males. Undiagnosed OSA may delay treatment for the sleep disorder and perhaps affect the development and progression of HTN.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20019018v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20019018v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Health Informatics

"Simultaneous estimation of bi-directional causal effects and heritable confounding from GWAS summary statistics","Mendelian Randomisation (MR), an increasingly popular method that estimates the causal effects of risk factors on complex human traits, has seen several extensions that relax its basic assumptions. However, most of these extensions suffer from two major limitations; their under-exploitation of genome-wide markers, and sensitivity to the presence of a heritable confounder of the exposure-outcome relationship. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Latent Heritable Confounder MR (LHC-MR) method applicable to association summary statistics, which estimates bi-directional causal effects, direct heritability, and confounder effects while accounting for sample overlap. We demonstrate that LHC-MR outperforms several existing MR methods in a wide range of simulation settings and apply it to summary statistics of 13 complex traits. Besides several concordant results, LHC-MR unravelled new mechanisms (how being diagnosed for certain diseases might lead to improved lifestyle) and revealed potential false positive findings of standard MR methods (apparent causal effect of body mass index on educational attainment may be driven by a strong ignored confounder). Phenome-wide search to identify LHC-implied heritable confounders showed remarkable agreement between the LHC-estimated causal effects of the latent confounder and those for the potentially identified ones. Finally, LHC-MR naturally decomposes genetic correlation to causal effect-driven and confounder-driven contributions, demonstrating that the genetic correlation between systolic blood pressure and diabetes is predominantly confounder-driven.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018929v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018929v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Trends in hepatitis C virus seroprevalence and associated risk factors among men who have sex with men in Montreal: results from three cross-sectional studies (2005, 2009, 2018)","Introduction: 
To eliminate the hepatitis C virus (HCV) by 2030, Canada must adopt a micro-elimination approach targeting priority populations, including gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). HCV prevalence and risk factors among MSM populations are context-dependent, and accurately describing these indicators at the local level is essential if we want to design appropriate, targeted prevention and treatment interventions. We aimed first to estimate and investigate temporal trends in HCV seroprevalence between 2005-2018 among Montreal MSM, and then to identify the socio-economic, behavioural, and biological factors associated with HCV exposure among this population.
Methods: 
We used data from three bio-behavioural cross-sectional surveys conducted among Montreal MSM in 2005 (n=1,795), 2009 (n=1,258), and 2018 (n=1,086). To ensure comparability of seroprevalence estimates across time, we standardized the 2005 and 2009 time-location samples to the 2018 respondent-driven sample. Time trends overall and stratified by HIV status, history of injection drug use (IDU), and age were examined. Modified Poisson regression analyses with generalized estimating equations were used to identify factors associated with HCV seropositivity pooling all surveys. We used multiple imputation by chained equations for all missing values.
Results: 
Standardized HCV seroprevalence among all MSM remained stable from 7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3-10%) in 2005, to 8% (95%CI: 1-9%) in 2009, and 8% (95%CI: 4-11%) in 2018. This apparent stability hides diverging temporal trends in seroprevalence between age groups, with a decrease among MSM <30 years old, and an increase among MSM aged =45 years. History of IDU was the strongest predictor for HCV seropositivity (adjusted prevalence ratio: 8.0; 95%CI: 5.5-11.5), and no association was found between HCV seroprevalence and the sexual risk factors studied (condomless anal sex with men of serodiscordant/unknown HIV status, number of sexual partners, and group sex), nor with biological markers of syphilis.
Conclusions: 
HCV seroprevalence remained stable among Montreal MSM between 2005-2018. Unlike other settings where HCV infection was strongly associated with sexual risk factors among MSM subgroups, IDU was the preeminent risk factor for HCV seropositivity. Understanding the intersection of IDU contexts, practices, and populations is essential to prevent HCV transmission among MSM.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018994v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018994v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Epidemiology

"Epidemiological identification of a novel infectious disease in real time: Analysis of the atypical pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, 2019-20","Objective: Virological tests indicate that a novel coronavirus is the most likely explanation for the 2019-20 pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing.

Methods: Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of ten existing pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to ""Disease X"" (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued.

Results: The probability that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 32% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 Jan 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 59%.

Conclusions: We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen. The proposed approach, that uses only routinely-observed non-virological data, can aid ongoing risk assessments even before virological test results become available.

"Consultation length by multimorbidity and deprivation: observational study using electronic patient records","Longer GP consultations are recommended for people with multimorbidity. In Scotland, multimorbid patients in deprived areas did not have longer consultations though their counterparts in the least deprived areas did. We are not aware of research testing this particular example of the inverse care law in England.

We set out to assess length of GP consultation for patients with and without multimorbidity and whether this varies by socioeconomic deprivation. A random sample of over 1.2 million consultations between 1 April 2014 and 31 March 2016 for 185,755 adults in England was drawn from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Consultation duration was derived from time of opening and closing the electronic record. Duration was modelled as a function of multimorbidity status, index of multiple deprivation, and their interaction, with adjustment for age, sex, GP trainee status and patient level random effect.

Mean adjusted consultation length in the most deprived fifth of areas was 10.8 (95 per cent  CI 10.7,10.9) minutes for people with 2+ physical conditions and 11.0 (CI 10.9,11.1) minutes for people with 2+ conditions including a mental health condition. This compares with 11.0 (CI 10.9,11.0) minutes for non-multimorbid people in the least deprived fifth of areas. 

Consultation length for people with multimorbidity in the most deprived areas is no higher than that for non-multimorbid people in the least deprived areas. Further research is needed to assess the impact of consultation length on patient and system outcomes for people with multimorbidity.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018960v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018960v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Primary Care Research

"Implementation of data access and use procedures in clinical data warehouses. A systematic review of literature and publicly available policies","Background
The promises of improved health care and health research through data-intensive applications rely on a growing amount of health data. At the core of large-scale data integration efforts, clinical data warehouses (CDW) are also responsible of data governance, managing data access and (re)use. As the complexity of the data flow increases, greater transparency and standardization of criteria and procedures is required in order to maintain objective oversight and control. This study assessed the spectrum of data access and use criteria and procedures in clinical data warehouses governance internationally.

Methods
We performed a systematic review of (a) the published scientific literature on CDW and (b) publicly available information on CDW data access, e.g., data access policies. A qualitative thematic analysis was applied to all included literature and policies.

Results
Twenty-three scientific publications and one policy document were included in the final analysis. The qualitative analysis led to a final set of three main thematic categories: (1) requirements, including recipient requirements, reuse requirements, and formal requirements; (2) structures and processes, including review bodies and review values; and (3) access, including access limitations.

Conclusions
The description of data access and use governance in the scientific literature is characterized by a high level of heterogeneity and ambiguity. In practice, this might limit the effective data sharing needed to fulfil the high expectations of data-intensive approaches in medical research and health care. The lack of publicly available information on access policies conflicts with ethical requirements linked to principles of transparency and accountability.
CDW should publicly disclose by whom and under which conditions data can be accessed, and provide designated governance structures and policies to increase transparency on data access. The results of this review may contribute to the development of practice-oriented minimal standards for the governance of data access, which could also result in a stronger harmonization, efficiency, and effectiveness of CDW.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018861v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018861v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Health Policy

"Incorporating Nonlinear Kinetics to Improve the Predictive Performance of Population Pharmacokinetic Models for Ciclosporin in Adult Renal Transplant Recipients: A Comparison of Modelling Strategies","Abstract
Aim: Ciclosporin (CsA) has been shown to follow nonlinear pharmacokinetics in renal transplant recipients who received Neoral-based triple immunosuppressive therapy. Some of these nonlinear properties have not been fully considered in population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the potential influence of nonlinearity and the functional forms of covariates on model predictability.
Methods: A total of 2969 CsA whole-blood measurements, including 1328 pre-dose and 1641 2-h post-dose concentrations, were collected from 173 patients who underwent their first renal transplantation. Four popPK models based on different modelling strategies were developed to investigate the discrepancy between empirical and theory-based, linear and nonlinear compartmental kinetic models and empirical formulae on model predictability. Prediction-based and simulation-based diagnostics (prediction- corrected visual predictive checks) were performed to determine the stability and predictive performance of these four models.
Results: Model predictability improved when nonlinearity was considered. The theory-based nonlinear model which incorporated nonlinear property based on known theoretical relationships performed better than the other two compartmental models. The nonlinear Michaelis-Menten model showed a remarkable improvement in predictive performance over that of the other three compartmental models. The saturated binding of CsA to erythrocytes, and auto-inhibition that arose from the inhibitory effects of CsA on CYP3A4/P-gp and CsA-prednisolone drug interaction may have contributed to the nonlinearity.
Conclusions: Incorporating nonlinear properties are likely to be a promising approach for improving CsA model predictability. However, CsA nonlinear kinetics resources need further investigation. Until then, Michaelis-Menten empirical model can be used for CsA dose adjustments.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.20018820v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.20018820v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Pharmacology and Therapeutics

"Altered thalamocortical structural connectivity in persons with schizophrenia and healthy siblings","Schizophrenia has long been theorized as a ""misconnection syndrome"" - abnormal connections in thalamocortical circuitry may be an underlying mechanism of psychotic symptomatology and cognitive impairments. There is emerging evidence for functional and structural hypoconnectivity between thalamus and prefrontal cortex in persons with schizophrenia (SZ), as well as hyperconnectivity between thalamus and sensory and motor cortices. However, it is unclear whether thalamocortical dysconnectivity is a general marker of vulnerability to schizophrenia or a specific mechanism of schizophrenia pathophysiology. This study aimed to answer this question by examining thalamocortical structural connectivity in healthy siblings of persons with schizophrenia (SIB). Twenty-two SZ, 20 SIB, and 45 healthy controls (HC) of either sex underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Probabilistic tractography was used to quantify structural connectivity between thalamus and six cortical regions of interest. Thalamocortical structural connectivity was compared among the three groups using cross-thalamic and voxel-wise approaches. Thalamo-prefrontal structural connectivity was reduced in both SZ and SIB relative to HC, while SZ and SIB did not differ from each other. Thalamo-motor structural connectivity was increased in SZ relative to SIB and HC, while SIB and HC did not differ from each other. Hemispheric differences also emerged in thalamic connectivity with motor, posterior parietal, and temporal cortices across all groups. The results support the hypothesis that altered thalamo-prefrontal structural connectivity is a general marker of vulnerability to schizophrenia, whereas altered connectivity between thalamus and motor cortex is related to illness expression or illness-related secondary factors.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.20018796v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.20018796v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Epidemiological characteristics of novel coronavirus infection: A statistical analysis of publicly available case data","The geographic spread of persons infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) provides an opportunity to study the natural history of the newly emerged virus. Migration events put travelers at risk of infection for the duration of their exposure to an area where transmission is known to occur. Using publicly available data of the ongoing epidemic of 2019-nCoV where event dates for cases have been shared, the present study estimated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern interpretation of the epidemiological dynamics of 2019-nCoV infections. Our results show that the incubation periods falls within the range of two to nine days with 95% confidence, and the median incubation period is 4-5 days when approximated using the Weibull distribution, which was the best fit model. The median time from illness onset to hospitalization was estimated at 3 days. Based on the estimate of the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of isolation and quarantine should be at least nine days. We also note that the median time delay of 13.8 days from illness onset to death should be considered when estimating the case fatality risk of this novel virus.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.20018754v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.20018754v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Non-pharmacological management of Alzheimer's disease, a qualitative study in Mauritius","Introduction
The major form of dementia is Alzheimer disease (AD). In Mauritius it was estimated in 2015 that around 10,000 persons had Alzheimer disease from Alzheimer disease International report . This represent 16 percent of the total population and it is expected to rise.  Therefore, apart from pharmacological therapies, non pharmacological treatment (NPT) which can improve cognitive performance such as cognitive training, occupational therapy, reminiscence therapy, are being highly investigated. 
Aim and objective
To determine the outcome(s) and to highlight the effective strategies in the management of Alzheimer Disease in Mauritius using NPT. Information obtained from this research will add to the current knowledge and expansion.
Materials and methods: 
The only NGO in Mauritius is Alzheimer Association, from where the persons with AD were recruited.  Non-interventional methods of qualitative study involving interviews of person with AD, lasting 30 to 45 minutes (audio recorded) were audio-recorded. An informed consent from the carer or patient relative prior to starting was ensured.  Both semi-structured interviews and open-ended questions were used, relating to NPT.  Thematic analysis in qualitative research, followed by coding and decoding raw data. Similar categories of data were grouped and themes emerged.
Results
In-depth responses of the person with AD related with their experiences, perceptions, opinions, feelings, and knowledge. Qualitative study (n=20) emerged with 6 main themes.  Among these, dependency on family identified as an important theme.  It has also been associated as an important form of cognitive and functional engagement for person with AD.
Discussion
Non-pharmacological interventions has an important role to prolong the active age of older individuals, as well as to maintain quality of life.
Conclusion 
There is still a greater demand on the market for non pharmacological interventions and Mauritius should plan and devise national guidelines to deal with this unmet proportion of elderly so as to curb for future health equality and stability.

"Streptococcus intermedius as a leading agent of brain abscess: retrospective analysis of a UK cohort","Background: Brain abscess is an uncommon condition, but carries high mortality. Current treatment guidelines are based on limited data. Surveillance of clinical, radiological and microbiology data is important to inform patient stratification, interventions, and antimicrobial stewardship.
Methods: We undertook a retrospective, observational study of patients with brain abscess, based on hospital coding, in a UK tertiary referral teaching hospital. We reviewed imaging data, laboratory microbiology, and antibiotic prescriptions.  
Results: Over a 47 month period, we identified 47 adults with bacterial brain abscess (77% male, median age 47 years). Most of the abscesses were solitary frontal or parietal lesions. A microbiological diagnosis was secured in 39/47 (83%) of cases, among which the majority were of the Streptococcus milleri group (27/39; 69%), with a predominance of Streptococcus intermedius (19/27; 70%). Patients received a median of 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics (most commonly ceftriaxone), followed by variable oral follow-on regimens. Ten patients (21%) died, up to 146 days after diagnosis. Mortality was significantly associated with increasing age, multiple abscesses, immunosuppression and the presence of an underlying cardiac anomaly.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that there has been a shift away from staphylococcal brain abscesses, towards S. intermedius as a dominant pathogen. In our setting, empiric current first line therapy with ceftriaxone remains appropriate on microbiological grounds and narrower spectrum therapy may sometimes be justified. Mortality of this condition remains high among patients with comorbidity. Prospective studies are required to inform optimum dose, route and duration of antimicrobial therapy.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.20018788v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.20018788v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Seasonally Variant Gene Expression in Full-Term Human Placenta","Seasonal exposures influence human health and development. The placenta, as a mediator of the maternal and fetal systems and a regulator of development, is an ideal tissue to understand the biological pathways underlying relationships between season of birth and later life health outcomes. Here, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study of season of birth in full-term human placental tissue to evaluate whether the placenta may be influenced by seasonal cues. Of the analyzed transcripts, 583 displayed differential expression between summer and winter births (FDR q<0.05); among these, BHLHE40, MIR210HG, and HILPDA had increased expression among winter births (Bonferroni p<0.05). Enrichment analyses of the seasonally variant genes between summer and winter births indicated over-representation of transcription factors HIF1A, VDR, and CLOCK, among others, and of GO term pathways related to ribosomal activity and infection. Additionally, a cosinor analysis found rhythmic expression for approximately 11.9% of all 17,664 analyzed placental transcripts. These results suggest that the placenta responds to seasonal cues and add to the growing body of evidence that the placenta acts as a peripheral clock, which may provide a molecular explanation for the extensive associations between season of birth and health outcomes.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018671v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018671v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Reduced synaptic density in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome, revealed by [11C]UCB-J PET.","Synaptic loss is prominent in several human neurodegenerative diseases. We tested the hypothesis that synaptic density is reduced by the primary tauopathies of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP-Richardson's syndrome) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Thirty-seven participants (12 CBS, 10 PSP, and 15 age-/sex-/education-matched controls) underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessment, 3T magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography with the radioligand [11C]UCB-J which targets the Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). 10 CBS patients had negative -amyloid biomarkers (Pittsburgh Compound B PET). As expected, patients with PSP-Richardson's syndrome and amyloid-negative CBS were impaired in executive, memory and visuospatial tasks. [11C]UCB-J binding was reduced across frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, cingulate, hippocampus, insula, amygdala and subcortical structures in both PSP and CBS patients compared to controls (p<0.001), with reductions up to 50%, consistent with post mortem data. The revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination score correlated positively with [11C]UCB-J binding in frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, and cingulate cortices, as well as in the  hippocampus, insula and amygdala, p<0.05); putamen and frontal lobe [11C]UCB-J binding correlated inversely with the PSP rating scale ( p<0.05). In conclusion, we confirm severe synaptic loss in PSP and CBS, which correlates with disease severity, providing critical insights into the underlying pathophysiology of primary degenerative tauopathies and supporting potential treatment strategies based on synaptic maintenance or restoration.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018697v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018697v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Neurology

"Lab-wide association scan of polygenic scores identifies biomarkers of complex disease","Clinical laboratory (lab) tests are used in clinical practice to diagnose, treat, and monitor disease conditions. Test results are typically stored in electronic health records (EHRs), and a growing number of EHRs are linked to patient DNA, offering unprecedented opportunities to query relationships between clinical lab tests and genetics. Clinical lab data, however, are of uneven quality, and previous studies have focused on a small number of lab traits. We present two methods, QualityLab and LabWAS, to clean and analyze EHR labs at scale in a Lab-Wide Association Scan. In a proof of concept analysis focused on blood lipids and coronary artery disease, we found that heritability estimates of QualityLab lipid values were comparable to previous reports; polygenic scores for lipids were strongly associated with the referent lipid in a LabWAS; and a LabWAS of a polygenic score for coronary artery disease recapitulated known heart disease biomarker profiles and identified novel associations.

"Resting and functional pupil response metrics indicate features of reward sensitivity and Autism Spectrum Disorder in children","Altered motivational drives and aberrant reward system function may contribute to the social impairments observed in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Pupil metrics have been highlighted as peripheral indicators of autonomic arousal and reward system function, specifically noradrenergic and dopaminergic activity that influence motivational drive states. However, research on individual differences in the neurobiological correlates of reward responsivity and clinically relevant features associated with ASD is sparse. The goal of the current study was to examine the relationship between measures of sensitivity to punishment and reward, ASD features, and resting as well as functional pupil response metrics across a clinically heterogeneous pediatric sample. We assessed whether quantitative features of reward sensitivity are linearly related to core clinical features of ASD. Pupil metrics were measured using a passive eye tracking task. Scores on a parent-report measure of punishment and reward sensitivity were found to be positively correlated with ASD features. Given these relationships, we assessed whether pupil measurements could be used as a neurobiological correlate of reward sensitivity and predictor of clinically significant ASD traits. In a logistic regression model, we find that the amplitude of pupil dilation, along with sex and full-scale IQ, could be used to correctly classify 84.9% of participants as having an ASD diagnosis versus not having an ASD diagnosis. This research highlights individual differences of reward sensitivity that scale with ASD features. Furthermore, reported results emphasize that functional pupil response metrics and other objective patient-level variables can be used together as predictors of ASD diagnostic status.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018648v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018648v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"A reappraisal of polymyxin B dosing based on population pharmacokinetic model in patient with renal insufficiency","Background: Current FDA-approved label recommends polymyxin B dosing should be adjusted according to renal function, despite several studies proved poor correlation between polymyxin B PK and creatinine clearance. The study aims to assess the impact of renal function on polymyxin B metabolism and identify an alternate dosing strategy by population analysis. 
Methods: Blood samples from adult patients were collected at steady state during routine therapeutic drug monitoring. Nonlinear mixed effects modeling was employed to build a population PK model of polymyxin B. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to design polymyxin B dosing regimens across various renal function. 
Results: Pharmacokinetic analyses included 112 polymyxin B concentrations at steady state from 32 adult patients aged 37-93 received intravenous polymyxin B (100-200 mg/d). The creatinine clearance in patients was 5.91-244 mL/min. In the final population PK model, CrCL was the significant covariate on CL (typical value, 1.59 L/hr; between-subject variability, 13%). Mean (SD) individual empirical Bayesian estimates of CL was 1.75 (0.43) L/hr. A new dosing strategy combining the PK/PD targets and Monte Carlo simulation indicated that polymyxin B dose reductions improved the probability of achieving optimal exposures in simulated patients with renal insufficiency. For severe infections caused by organisms with MIC of = 2 mg/L, though a high daily dose (e.g. 200mg/day) would possible for bacterial eradication, the risk of nephrotoxicity is significantly increased.
Conclusion: A population PK model was established to develop individualized polymyxin B dosage regimens that the dose of polymyxin B should be adjusted according to CrCL.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018481v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018481v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Pharmacology and Therapeutics

"Associations between dietary patterns and gene expression pattern in peripheral blood mononuclear cells: a cross-sectional study","Background: Diet may alter gene expression in immune cells involved in cardio-metabolic disease susceptibility. However, we still lack a robust understanding of the association between diet and immune cell-related gene expression in humans.

Objective: Our objective was to examine the associations between dietary patterns (DPs) and gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a population of healthy, Norwegian adults.

Methods: We used factor analysis to define a posteriori DPs from food frequency questionnaire-based dietary assessment data. In addition, we derived interpretable features from microarray-based gene expression data (13 967 transcripts) using two algorithms: CIBERSORT for estimation of cell subtype proportions, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) for cluster discovery. Finally, we associated DPs with either CIBERSORT-predicted PBMC leukocyte distribution or WGCNA gene clusters using linear regression models. All analyses were gender-stratified (n = 130 women and 105 men).

Results: We detected three DPs that broadly reflected Western, Vegetarian, and Low carb diets. CIBERSORT-predicted percentage of monocytes associated strongly and negatively with the Vegetarian DP in both women and men. For women, the Vegetarian DP associated most strongly with a large gene cluster consisting of 600 genes mainly involved in regulation of DNA transcription. For men, the Western DP inversely associated most strongly with a smaller cluster of 36 genes mainly involved in regulation of metabolic and inflammatory processes. In subsequent protein-protein interaction network analysis, the most important driver genes within these WGCNA gene clusters seemed to physically interact in biological networks.

Conclusions: DPs may affect percentage monocytes and regulation of key biological processes within the PBMC pool. Although the present findings are exploratory, our analysis pipeline serves a useful framework for studying the association between diet and gene expression.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.20018465v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.20018465v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Nutrition

"Interpretable Clinical Genomics with a Likelihood Ratio Paradigm","Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)-based analysis has become standard for genomic diagnostics of rare diseases. Current algorithms use a variety of semantic and statistical approaches to prioritize the typically long lists of genes with candidate pathogenic variants. These algorithms do not provide robust estimates of the strength of the predictions beyond the placement in a ranked list, nor do they provide measures of how much any individual phenotypic observation has contributed to the prioritization result. However, given that the overall success rate of genomic diagnostics is only around 25-50% or less in many cohorts, a good ranking cannot be taken to imply that the gene or disease at rank one is necessarily a good candidate. Likelihood ratios (LR) are statistics for summarizing diagnostic accuracy, providing a measure of how much more (or less) a patient with a disease has a particular test result compared to patients without the disease. Here, we present an approach to genomic diagnostics that exploits the LR framework to provide an estimate of (1) the posttest probability of candidate diagnoses; (2) the LR for each observed HPO phenotype, and (3) the predicted pathogenicity of observed genotypes. LIkelihood Ratio Interpretation of Clinical AbnormaLities (LIRICAL) placed the correct diagnosis within the first three ranks in 92.9% of 384 cases reports comprising 262 Mendelian diseases, with the correct diagnosis having a mean posttest probability of 67.3%. Simulations show that LIRICAL is robust to many typically encountered forms of genomic and phenomic noise. In summary, LIRICAL provides accurate, clinically interpretable results for phenotype-driven genomic diagnostics.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.19014803v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.19014803v1.full.pdf","2020-01-28","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

Cox-nnet based imaging predictions are more robust and accurate than Cox-PH. Moreover, using a novel two-stage Cox-nnet complex model, we are able to combine pathology image and transcriptomics RNA-Seq data to make impressively accurate prognosis predictions, with C-index close to 0.90 and log-ranked p-value of 4e-21 in the testing dataset.

"Colonoscopy and reduction of colorectal cancer risk by molecular tumor subtypes: a population-based case-control study","Objective: In previous studies, the protective effect of colonoscopy was generally stronger for distal than for proximal colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to investigate whether the association of colonoscopy and CRC risk varies according to major molecular pathological features and pathways of CRC.

Design: Population-based case-control study from Germany, including 2132 patients with a first diagnosis of CRC and information on major molecular tumor markers, and 2486 control participants without CRC. Detailed participant characteristics were collected by standardized questionnaires and information on previous colonoscopy was derived from medical records. Polytomous logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between previous colonoscopy and subtypes of CRC.

Results: Overall, we observed strong risk reduction of CRC after colonoscopy that was weaker for microsatellite instable (MSI) than for non-MSI CRC (p for heterogeneity <0.01), for CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) high CRC than for CIMP low/negative CRC (p het<0.01), for BRAF-mutated than for BRAF non-mutated CRC (p het=0.01), for KRAS non-mutated than for KRAS-mutated CRC (p het=0.04), and for CRC classified into the sessile serrated pathway than for CRC of the traditional pathway (p het<0.01). After colonoscopy with detection of adenomas, no risk reduction was found for sessile serrated pathway CRC. 

Conclusion: Our study extends the molecular understanding of existing differences in risk reduction of proximal and distal CRC reported by previous studies, and may imply important information for improving strategies for timely detection of relevant precursors.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017137v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017137v2.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Gastroenterology

"Violin plot data: A concerto of crucial information on valve thrombogenicity classified using laboratory measured valve motion","Abstract:
Objectives 
This in vitro study compares mechanical (MHV) and bioprosthetic (BHV) heart valves for high amplitude short duration regional flow velocities (RFV) near valve closure.
Background 
We previously tested several clinical and prototype valves and observed RFV at levels which may be related to a dimensionless thrombogenic potential (TP).  
Methods 
A total of four valves were tested in aortic and mitral sites under pulsatile circulation in a pulse duplicator. Valves included both clinical models and experimental prototypes. An optical approach measuring projected dynamic valve area (PDVA) to gauge valve motion was implemented. Pulsatile pressures and flow rates were measured by conventional techniques and a quasi-steady flow tester was used to measure valve leakage. RFV was derived using time-dependent volumetric flow rate/PDVA. Since flow velocity and fluid shear force are related through flow velocity gradient, TPs for valves that achieve near closure during the forward flow deceleration phase were determined as RFVs relative to the control mechanical valve RFV value of -126 m/s.  
Results
TP is dimensionless and ranged between -0.45 and +1.0. Negative TPs arise when transient rebound of valve occluders is accompanied by water-hammer phenomena. Positive TPs occur during the decelerating forward flow. Bioprostheses had lowest TP transient of 0.15 with exception of a mock-transcatheter aortic valve (mTAVI) that incorporated by design a trivial perivalvular leak (~1.35 ml/s). This device demonstrated a remarkably high transient TP of 0.95. The control mechanical valves had the highest TP of 1.0. The study implicates TP transients near mechanical valve closure, and not forward or non-flow phases, as primary to shear induced activation of the coagulation cascade.
Conclusions
Our data reveals distinct TP profile differences between valve models. If verifiable, the design of future valves may utilize currently available experimental tools to determine TPs resulting in advanced devices with significantly reduced TP.","/content/10.1101/19009407v5?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009407v5.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Cardiovascular Medicine

"A Precision Medicine Framework for Personalized Simulation of Hemodynamics in Cerebrovascular Disease","Introduction
Cerebrovascular disease is a major public health challenge. An important biomarker is cerebral hemodynamics. To measure cerebral hemodynamics, however, only invasive, potentially harmful or time-to-treatment prolonging methods are available. We present a simulation-based alternative which allows calculation of cerebral hemodynamics based on the individual vessel configuration of a patient derived from structural vessel imaging. 

Methods
We implemented a framework allowing annotation of extracted brain vessels from structural imaging followed by 0-dimensional lumped modelling of cerebral hemodynamics. For annotation, a 3D-graphical user interface (GUI) was implemented. For 0D-simulation, we used a modified nodal analysis (MNA), which was adapted for easy implementation by code. The code was written in-house in java. The simulation GUI allows inspection of simulation results, identification of vulnerable areas, simulation of changes due to different systemic blood pressures. Moreover, sensitivity analysis was implemented allowing the live simulation of changes of variables such as vessel lumen to simulate procedures and disease courses. In two exemplary patients, simulation results were compared to dynamic-susceptibility-weighted-contrast-enhanced magnetic-resonance(DSC-MR) perfusion imaging.

Results
The successful implementation of the framework allowing individualized annotation and simulation of patients is presented. In two exemplary patients, both the simulation as well as DSC-MRI showed the same results pertaining to the identification of areas vulnerable to ischemia. Sensitivity analysis allows the individualized simulation of changes in vessel lumen and the effect on hemodynamics.

Discussion
We present the first precision medicine pipeline for cerebrovascular disease which allows annotation of the arterial vasculature derived from structural vessel imaging followed by personalized simulation of brain hemodynamics. This paves the way for further development of precision medicine in stroke using novel biomarkers and might make the application of harmful and complex perfusion methods obsolete for certain use cases in the future.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019190v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019190v1.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Neurology

"An individualized risk prediction model for new-onset, progression and regression of chronic kidney disease in a retrospective cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes under primary care in Hong Kong","Objectives: This study is aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for multi-state transitions across different stages of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus under primary care. 
Setting: We retrieved the anonymized electronic health records of a population based retrospective cohort in Hong Kong. 
Participants: A total of 26,197 patients were included in the analysis. 
Primary and secondary outcome measures: The new-onset, progression, and regression of chronic kidney disease were defined by the transitions of four stages that were classified by combining glomerular filtration rate and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. We applied a multi-scale multi-state Poisson regression model to estimate the rates of the stage transitions by integrating the baseline demographic characteristics, routine laboratory test results and clinical data from electronic health records. 
Results:  During the mean follow-up time of 1.7 years, there were 2,935 patients newly diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, 1,443 progressed to the next stage and 1,971 regressed into an earlier stage. The models achieved the best performance in predicting the new-onset and progression with the predictors of sex, age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides and drug prescriptions. 
Conclusions:  This study demonstrated that individual risks of new-onset and progression of chronic kidney disease can be predicted from the routine physical and laboratory test results. The individualized prediction curves developed from this study could potentially be applied to routine clinical practices, to facilitate clinical decision making, risk communications with patients and early interventions.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019182v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019182v1.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Artificial Intelligence Assisted Early Warning System for Acute Kidney Injury Driven by Multi-Center ICU Database","Background: To improve the performance of early acute kidney injury (AKI) prediction in intensive care unit (ICU), we developed and externally validated machine learning algorithms in two large ICU databases.
Methods: Using eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU) and MIMIC-III databases, we selected all adult patients (age = 18). The detection of AKI was based on both the oliguric and serum creatinine criteria of the KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes). We developed an early warning system for forecasting the onset of AKI within the first week of ICU stay, by using 6- or 12-hours as the data extraction window and make a prediction within a 1-hour window after a gap window of 6- or 12-hours. We used 52 features which are routinely available ICU data as predictors. eICU was used for model development, and MIMIC-III was used for externally validation. We applied and experimented on eight machine learning algorithms for the prediction task.
Results: 3,816 unique admissions in multi-center eICU database were selected for model development, and 5,975 unique admissions in single-center MIMIC-III database were selected for external validation. The incidence of AKI within the first week of ICU stay in eICU and MIMIC-III cohorts was 52.1% (n=1,988) and 31.3% (n=1,870), respectively. In eICU cohort, the performance of AKI prediction is better with shorter extraction window and gap window. We found that the AdaBoost algorithm yielded the highest AUC (0.8859) on the model with 6-hours data extraction window and 6-hours gap window (model 6-6) rather than other prediction models. In MIMIC-III cohort, AdaBoost also performed well.
Conclusions: We developed the machine learning-based early AKI prediction model, which considered clinical important features and has been validated in two datasets.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20019091v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20019091v1.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine

"Incidence and outcomes of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders in lung transplant patients: analysis of ISHLT Registry","Background: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a life-threatening complication following lung transplant. We aimed to study the incidence of and risk factors for PTLD in adult lung transplant recipients.
Methods:  The International Society of Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) Registry was used to identify adult, first-time, single and bilateral lung transplant recipients with at least one year follow-up and from centers reporting PTLD between January 2006 and June 2015. Kaplan Meier method was used to describe timing and distribution of PTLD. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the clinical characteristics associated with PTLD.
Results: Of the 19,309 lung transplant recipients in the analysis cohort, we identified 454 cases of PTLD. Cumulative incidence of PTLD was 1.1% (95% CI = 1.0%, 1.3%) at 1 year and 4.1% (95% CI= 3.6%, 4.6%) at 10-years. We observed that 47.4% of all PTLD cases occurred within the first year following lung transplantation. In the multivariable model, independent risk factors for PTLD included age, EBV mismatch and native lung diseases. The risk of PTLD during the first year after transplant increased with increasing age in patients between 45 to 62 years at time of transplantation; the inverse was true for ages less than 45 year or greater than 62 years. Finally, receiving a donor organ with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types A1 and A24 was associated with an increased risk of PTLD while the recipient HLA type DR11 was associated with a decreased risk.
Conclusions: Our study indicates that PTLD is a relatively rare complication among adult lung transplant recipients. We identified clinical characteristics that are associated with increased risk of PTLD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20019042v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20019042v1.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Transplantation

"Preservation of cognition in hypertension-treated South Indian rural population","Change in diet life style and increased life expectancy has led to the dramatic escalation in old age related complication like cognitive decline leading to dementia. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are huge risk factors for dementia, including Alzheimer disease (AD). Hypertension is very well known to cause cognitive impairment.  Control of CVD could provide protection against dementia. Earlier in the mouse model of AD, reserpine, an antihypertensive and antipsychotic drug could elicit improvement in the working memory in AD model mice and enhance the same in normal mice. Hence, Cognitive protection in the patients on chronic antihypertensive drug which contains reserpine was evaluated. Cognition in a cohort (in the South Indian rural population) of hypertensive patients (majority age group 50 to 70 years) who have been chronically treated with a combinatorial drug(adelphane/adelphane esidrexsodl by Novaritis Switzerland) consisting of reserpine and hydrazine for years was compared with controls without hypertension. The cohorts were age sex socio-economic education background matched. Cognition was scored using the Tamil version of: Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination-III (ACEIII (Tamil)) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Tamil) scales.  The composite ACEIII (Tamil) score of control and treated groups were 53.6 and   53.2 respectively. MoCA(tamil) scores (Control :15.1 and Treated: 14.7) did not show much alteration. Further the mean scores of the control and treated groups individual components of cognition in ACE, namely Attention Memory Fluency Language and visuospatial cognitive skills also did not reveal significant difference. Thus controlling blood pressure or hypertension with chronic antihypertensive medication like adelphane/adelphane esirdex (reserpine containing drugs) has retained normal cognition in both genders.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019125v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019125v1.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Emotional and behavioural phenotypes in young people with neurodevelopmental CNVs","Background:
A number of disorders caused by copy number variants (CNVs) are associated with a high risk of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairments (ND-CNVs). Few studies of ND-CNVs have investigated the emotional and behavioural problems that are important outcomes in young people with developmental and intellectual disabilities using appropriate measures. 
Methods:
322 young people with 13 ND-CNVs across eight loci (mean age:9.79 years, range:6.02-17.91, 66.5% male) took part in the study. Primary carers completed the Developmental Behaviour Checklist (DBC).
Results:
Sixty-seven percent of individuals with an ND-CNV screened positive for clinically significant difficulties. Young people from families with higher incomes (OR=0.71, CI=0.55 - 0.92, p=.009) were less likely to screen positive. Young people born after prolonged labour (OR=2.87, CI=1.18-8.13, p=.030) were more likely to screen positive. The rate of difficulties differed depending on ND-CNV genotype (Deviance=25.83, p=.011), with the lowest rate in 22q11.2 deletion (46%) and the highest in 1q21.1 deletion (87.5%). Individuals with inherited ND-CNVs had greater difficulties (F=6.54, df=1, p=.012, np2=.050), including higher self-absorbed (F=5.01, df=1, p=.027, np2=.039) and communication disturbance scores (F=9.13, df=1, p=.003, np2=.068). Specific patterns of strengths and weaknesses were found for different ND-CNV genotypes. However, ND-CNV genotype explained no more than 7-16% of variance, depending on subdomain. 
Conclusions:
Behavioural and emotional problems are common in young people with ND-CNVs. The ND-CNV specific patterns we find can provide a basis for more tailored support. More research is needed to better understand the variation in behavioural and emotional problems not accounted for by genotype.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019133v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019133v1.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Improvement in Inner Retinal Function in Glaucoma in Response to Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3 Supplementation: A Crossover Randomized Clinical Trial","Importance: Retinal ganglion cells endure significant metabolic stress with ageing and glaucoma-related stressors. Injured cells require increased energy for repair but maintain capacity to recover function despite periods of functional loss. Nicotinamide, a precursor of redox co-factor and metabolite, NAD+, is low in serum of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and its supplementation provides robust protection of retinal ganglion cells by targeting mitochondrial health in glaucoma models. However, the potential of nicotinamide to improve retinal ganglion cell function in humans with glaucoma is yet unknown.
Objective: To determine whether nicotinamide supplementation taken in conjunction with conventional IOP-lowering therapy leads to early improvement in retinal ganglion cell function in people with glaucoma.
Design: Crossover, double-masked, randomized clinical trial conducted between October 2017 to January 2019.
Setting: Study participants recruited from two tertiary care centers in Melbourne, Australia.
Participants: Adults diagnosed and treated for primary glaucoma. Ninety-four participants assessed for study eligibility.
Intervention: Participants randomized to first receive oral placebo or nicotinamide and reviewed six-weekly. Accelerated dosing method utilized; participants commenced 6-week course of 1.5 grams/day followed by 6 weeks of 3.0 grams/day. After 12 weeks, participants crossed over to other intervention for 12 weeks without washout. At each visit, visual function measured using full-field flash electroretinography and white-on-white perimetry.
Main outcome measures: Primary endpoint was change in inner retinal function determined a-priori as change in photopic negative response (PhNR) parameters: saturated PhNR amplitude (Vmax), ratio of PhNR/b-wave amplitude (Vmax ratio). 
Results: Fifty-seven participants (65.510.0 years, 39% female) enrolled. PhNR Vmax improved beyond 95% coefficient of repeatability (COR) in 23% of participants following 12 weeks of nicotinamide versus 9% on placebo. Conversely, PhNR Vmax deteriorated in 9% on placebo and 7% on nicotinamide. Overall, Vmax improved by 14.8% [95% CI: 2.8%, 26.9%], (p=0.02) on nicotinamide and 5.2% [-4.2%, 14.6%], (p=0.27) on placebo. Vmax ratio improved on average by 12.6% [5.0%, 20.2%], (p=0.002) following nicotinamide and 3.6% [-3.4%, 10.5%], (p=0.30) on placebo. A concomitant trend for improved visual field mean deviation was observed with 27% improving =1dB on nicotinamide and fewer deteriorating =1dB (4%) compared to placebo (p=0.02). Moderate correlation was observed between PhNR and visual field change with treatment. Participants demonstrated excellent treatment adherence rates (>94%) and nicotinamide was well tolerated with minimal side effects.
Conclusions and Relevance: Nicotinamide supplementation can improve inner retinal function in patients receiving concurrent IOP-lowering glaucoma therapy. Further studies are underway to elucidate the effects of long-term nicotinamide supplementation on glaucoma progression.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019075v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019075v1.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Ophthalmology

"Microbial contributions to oxalate metabolism in health and disease","Over-accumulation of oxalate in humans may lead to nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis. Humans lack endogenous oxalate degradation pathways (ODP), but intestinal microbiota can degrade oxalate and protect against its absorption. However, the particular microbes that actively degrade oxalate in vivo are ill-defined, which restricts our ability to disentangle the underlying taxonomic contributions. Here we leverage large-scale multi-omics data (>3000 samples from >1000 subjects) to show that the human microbiota in health harbors diverse ODP-encoding microbial species, but an oxalate autotroph-Oxalobacter formigenes- dominates this function transcriptionally. Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are at significantly increased risk for disrupted oxalate homeostasis and calcium-oxalate nephrolithiasis. Here, by analyzing multi-omics data from the iHMP-IBD study, we demonstrate that the oxalate degradation function conferred by the intestinal microbiota is severely impaired in IBD patients. In parallel, the enteric oxalate levels of IBD patients are significantly elevated and associated with intestinal disease severity, which is consistent with the clinically known nephrolithiasis risk. The specific changes in ODP expression by several important taxa suggest that they play different roles in the IBD-induced nephrolithiasis risk.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018770v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018770v1.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Health Informatics

"Relationships among Commercial Biases and Author Conflicts of Interest in Biomedical Publishing","Recently, concerns have been raised over the potential impacts of commercial biases on editorial practices in biomedical publishing. Specifically, it has been suggested that commercial biases may make editors more open to publishing articles with author conflicts of interest (aCOI). Using a data set of 128,781 articles published in 159 journals, we evaluated the relationships among commercial publishing biases and reported author conflicts of interest. The 159 journals were grouped according to commercial biases (reprint services, advertising revenue, and ownership by a large commercial publishing firm). 30.6% (39,440) of articles were published in journals showing no evidence of commercial publishing biases. 33.9% (43,630) were published in journals accepting advertising and reprint fees; 31.7% (40,887) in journals owned by large publishing firms; 1.2% (1,589) in journals accepting reprint fees only; and 2.5 % (3,235) in journals accepting only advertising fees. Journals with commercial biases were more likely to publish articles with aCOI (9.2% (92/1000) vs. 6.4% (64/1000), p = 0.024). In the multivariate analysis, only a journal's acceptance of reprint fees served as a significant predictor (OR = 2.81 at 95% CI, 1.5 to 8.6). Shared control estimation was used to evaluate the relationships between commercial publishing biases and aCOI frequency in total and by type. BCa-corrected mean difference effect sizes ranged from -1.0 to 6.1, and confirm findings indicating that accepting reprint fees may constitute the most significant commercial bias. The findings indicate that concerns over the influence of industry advertising in medical journals may be overstated, and that accepting fees for reprints may constitute the largest risk of bias for editorial decision-making.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018705v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018705v1.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Medical Ethics

"Automatic Detection of Target Engagement in Transcutaneous Cervical Vagal Nerve Stimulation for Traumatic Stress Triggers","Transcutaneous cervical vagal nerve stimulation (tcVNS) devices are attractive alternatives to surgical implants, and can be applied for a number of conditions in ambulatory settings, including stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Transferring tcVNS technologies to at-home settings brings challenges associated with the assessment of therapy response. The ability to accurately detect whether tcVNS has been effectively delivered in a remote setting such as the home has never been investigated. We designed and conducted a study in which 12 human subjects received active tcVNS and 14 received sham stimulation in tandem with traumatic stress, and measured continuous cardiopulmonary signals including the electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), seismocardiogram (SCG), and respiratory effort (RSP). We extracted physiological parameters related to autonomic nervous system activity, and created a feature set from these parameters to: 1) detect active (vs. sham) tcVNS stimulation presence with machine learning methods, and 2) determine which sensing modalities and features provide the most salient markers of tcVNS-based changes in physiological signals. Heart rate (ECG), vasomotor activity (PPG), and pulse arrival time (ECG+PPG) provided sufficient information to determine target engagement (compared to sham) in addition to other combinations of sensors. resulting in 96% accuracy, precision, and recall with a receiver operator characteristics area of 0.96. Two commonly utilized sensing modalities (ECG and PPG) that are suitable for home use can provide useful information on therapy response for tcVNS. The methods presented herein could be deployed in wearable devices to quantify adherence for at-home use of tcVNS technologies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018689v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018689v1.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Framework for Identifying Drug Repurposing Candidates from Observational Healthcare Data","Objective. Observational medical databases, such as electronic health records and insurance claims, track the healthcare trajectory of millions of individuals. These databases provide real-world longitudinal information on large cohorts of patients and their medication prescription history. We present an easy-to-customize framework that systematically analyzes such databases to identify new indications for on-market prescription drugs. 
Materials and Methods. Our framework provides an interface for defining study design parameters and extracting patient cohorts, disease-related outcomes, and potential confounders in two observational databases, covering more than 150 million patients. It then applies causal inference methodology to emulate hundreds of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for prescribed drugs, while adjusting for confounding and selection biases. After correcting for multiple testing, it outputs the estimated effects and their statistical significance in each database. 
Results. We demonstrate the utility of the framework in a case study of Parkinson's disease (PD) and evaluate the effect of 259 drugs on various PD progression measures. The results of these emulated trials reveal a remarkable agreement between the two observational medical databases for the most promising candidates.
Discussion. Estimating drug effects from observational data is challenging due to data biases and noise. To tackle this challenge, we integrate causal inference methodology with domain knowledge and compare the estimated effects in two separate databases. 
Conclusion. Our framework enables a systematic search for drug repurposing candidates by emulating RCTs that use observational data. The high level of agreement in the results obtained in two separate databases provides an internal validation of identified effects.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20018366v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20018366v1.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Health Informatics

"The increase in paraoxonase-1 is associated with a decrease in left ventricular volume in kidney transplant recipients.","Background: Patients on dialysis have impaired cardiac function, in part due to increased fluid volume and ventricular stress.  Restored kidney function through transplantation reduces left ventricular volume in both systole and diastole.  Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is reduced in patients on dialysis, which may be related to their impaired cardiac function.  We tested the hypothesis that change in PON1 is associated with changes in left ventricular (LV) end-volume and LV mass after kidney transplantation.
Methods: Patients were studied before and 12 months after kidney transplantation.  The control group was patients on dialysis not expected to receive a transplant in the next 12 months.  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume and LV mass.  PON1 was measured by arylesterase activity and by mass.
Results:  PON1 mass and activity were not different between the groups at baseline.  Both PON1 mass and activity were increased post-kidney transplantation (p<0.0001 for change).  The change in PON1 mass (p=0.0062) and PON1 arylesterase activity (p=0.0254) were inversely correlated with the change in NT-proBNP for patients receiving a kidney transplant.  However, only the change in the PON1 mass, but not the change in PON1 arylesterase, was inversely correlated with the change in left ventricular volume (ml/m2.7) (p=0.0146 and 0.0114 for diastolic and systolic, respectively) and with the change in hemoglobin (p=0.0042).

"Reduced loss aversion in subclinical negative symptoms and hypomania","Loss aversion is a behavioral phenomenon that describes a higher sensitivity to losses than to gains and influences decisions. Decision-making is altered in several psychopathologic states, such as in the two symptom dimensions of hypomania and negative symptoms. It has been argued that progress in our understanding of psychopathology requires a reorientation from the traditional, syndrome-based perspective to a more detailed study of individual constituent symptoms. In the present study, we made careful efforts to dissociate the relationship of loss aversion to negative symptoms, from its relationship with hypomanic symptoms. We selected a sample of 45 subjects from a healthy student population (n = 835) according to psychopathologic scales for hypomania and negative symptoms and stratified them into a control group (n = 15), a subclinical hypomania group (n = 15) and a negative symptoms group (n = 15). Participants completed a loss aversion task consisting of forced binary choices between a monetary gamble and a riskless choice with no gain or loss. We found, that these two symptom dimensions of hypomania and negative symptoms have a similar inverse relation to loss aversion as demonstrated by analysis of variance. Further research is warranted to describe the underlying psychological and neurobiological mechanisms at play. Given the partially opposing nature of hypomania and negative symptoms it further needs to be elucidated whether they are linked to loss aversion via dissociable mechanisms.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018119v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018119v1.full.pdf","2020-01-29","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"The incubation period of 2019-nCoV infections among travellers from Wuhan, China","Currently, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Little is known about its epidemiological characteristics. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 (5.6 - 7.7, 95% CI) days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile).

"Developing an Individualized Clinical Prediction Rules of Antihypertensive Drugs: A Study Protocol Based on Real-world Practice","Background: Hypertension is one of the most urgent public health challenges, and drug therapy is the primary method to control blood pressure for patients. However, blood pressure control rate is still poor with antihypertensive drugs use. Although Clinical Prediction Rules (CPR) is useful to help clinicians make more appropriate decisions at the point of medication, the evidence is still limited in china. The objective of this study is to develop an CPR of antihypertensive drugs in individualized application of patients based on real-world practice.
Methods:  A two-way cohort study has been conducted in one China's large tertiary hospital using clinical information on patient characteristics, drug use and clinical outcome. Data extraction is through ICD-10 disease codes of hypertension from Electronic Medical Record System. Eligible patients admitted from September 2016 to August 2018 who have received at least one antihypertensive drug therapy is included. Patients were grouped into several exposure groups according to medications. COX regression model and clinical specialty survey is applied to identify Influencing Factors (IF) in different study groups, and the discriminant model was used to construct a CPR according IF. The accuracy of the CPR is analyzed by sensitivity, specificity, Youden's index and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
Discussion: Result is expected to provide valuable CPR for physicians and policymakers with respect to treating hypertension according characteristic of individual patients. By developing a predictive method for clinical outcomes and treatment costs of antihypertensive medication, we expect to discriminate those patients who would profit from specific scheme of antihypertensive drugs to minimal incidence probability of costs and complications in region of china.

"Evaluation of Myocardial Perfusion and Immune Cell Response in Cardiac Allograft Dysfunction of Heart-Transplant Patients","Background: We investigated the myocardial perfusion differences and changes in immune cell response in heart-transplant patients with nonspecific graft dysfunction (NGD) compared to cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) patients and normal heart-transplant patients.
Methods and Results: 
We prospectively studied 17 heart-transplant patients (59.8+/-14.1 years, 78% male) from January to June 2016. Regadenoson stress cardiac MRI was performed in the patients and peripheral blood obtained contemporaneously to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Stress myocardial perfusion showed significantly decreased myocardial perfusion using maximum upslope method in NGD and CAV patients compared to normal heart-transplant patients. Myocardial scar by late gadolinium enhancement also was significantly increased in nonspecific graft dysfunction patients compared to normal. Evaluation of PBMCs by flow cytometry showed a trend towards increased activated HLA-DR+ T cells in NGD patients compared to normal. Clinical outcomes for cardiac hospitalization, allograft loss/retransplant, death were assessed at 3 years.
Conclusions: NGD shows decreased stress myocardial perfusion by cardiac MRI and a trend towards increased activated T cells in PBMCs, suggestive of an immune-mediated cause for allograft dysfunction.

"Antimicrobial treatment impacts resistance in off-target populations of a nosocomial bacterial pathogen: a case-control study.","The antimicrobial resistance crisis has persisted despite broad attempts at intervention. Detailed studies of the population dynamics that lead to resistance could identify additional intervention points. An important driver of resistance in the most concerning antibiotic resistant pathogens can be selection imposed on bacterial populations that are not the intended target of antimicrobial therapy. Here we focus on the important nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecium in a hospital system where resistance to daptomycin is evolving despite standard interventions. We hypothesized that the intravenous use of daptomycin generates off-target selection for resistance in transmissible gastrointestinal (carriage) populations of E. faecium.  We performed a case-control study in which the daptomycin resistance of E. faecium isolated from rectal swabs from daptomycin-exposed patients was compared to a control group of patients exposed to linezolid, a drug with similar indications. In the daptomycin-exposed group, daptomycin resistance of E. faecium from the off-target population was on average 50% higher than resistance in the control group (n=428 independent E. faecium clones from 22 patients). There was also greater phenotypic diversity in daptomycin resistance within daptomycin-exposed patients. Multiple samples over time were available from a subset of patients, and these demonstrate wide variability in temporal dynamics, from long-term maintenance of resistance to rapid return to sensitivity after daptomycin treatment stopped. Our results demonstrate that off-target gastrointestinal populations rapidly respond to intravenous antibiotic exposure. Gastrointestinal populations are the source for faecal transmission and so can be the driver for hospital-wide population level increases in resistance. Focusing on the off-target evolutionary dynamics may offer novel avenues to slow the spread of antibiotic resistance.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019323v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019323v1.full.pdf","2020-01-30","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Genomic determination of relative risks for Clostridioides difficile infection from asymptomatic carriage in ICU patients","Background: Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) are among the most prevalent hospital-associated infections (HAIs), particularly for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The risks for developing active CDI from asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile are not well understood. 
Methods: We identified asymptomatic C. difficile carriage among 1897 ICU patients, using rectal swabs from an existing ICU vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) surveillance program. C. difficile isolates from VRE swabs, and from C. difficile-positive stool samples, were genome sequenced to assess clonal relationships among isolates from asymptomatic carriers and CDI patients. Integrated genomic and epidemiologic analyses identified multiple cases of asymptomatic carriers who developed CDI, and of asymptomatic transmission of C. difficile to naive patients. 
Results: Genomic analyses identified diverse strains in infected patients and asymptomatic carriers. 7.4% of ICU patients asymptomatically carried C. difficile. 69% of isolates carried an intact toxin locus. In contrast, 96% of C. difficile stool isolates were toxigenic. CDI rates in asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic strains were 5.3%, versus 0.57% in non-carriers. The relative risk for CDI with asymptomatic carriage of a toxigenic strain was 9.32 (95% CI=3.25-26.7). Genomic identification of clonal clusters supported epidemiologic analyses for asymptomatic transmission events, with spatial-temporal overlaps identified in 13 of 28 cases.
Conclusions: Our studies provide the first genomically-confirmed assessments of CDI relative risk from asymptomatic carriage of toxigenic strains and highlight the complex dynamics of asymptomatic transmission in ICUs. C. difficile screening can be implemented within existing HAI surveillance programs and, with isolation of asymptomatic carriers, has potential to reduce these risks.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019489v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019489v1.full.pdf","2020-01-30","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Decline in respiratory deaths not associated with influenza in Russia: effect of the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), or improvement in care?","Background. Pneumococcal vaccination (PCV13) for children (as well as older adults) in Russia was introduced in 2014, with no prior PCV7 use. While pneumonia hospitalization rates, both in children and adults did not decrease in the following years, respiratory mortality rates declined with time. Moreover, there is a strong association between antibiotic, including multidrug resistance and PCV13 vaccine serotypes for S. pneumoniae in children in Russia, and presence of S. pneumoniae among sepsis cases in Russia during the recent years has been very low. Annual variability in influenza circulation may affect some of the changes in respiratory mortality rates, obscuring the trends in respiratory mortality related to pneumococcal vaccination.
Methods. We applied the inference method from our recent study of influenza-associated mortality in Russia to relate monthly respiratory mortality rates between 09/2010 and 08/2019 to monthly indices of influenza circulation and baseline rates of mortality not associated with influenza, allowing for a potential trend in the baseline rates starting 2015.
Results. Baseline rates of respiratory mortality not associated with influenza decreased with time starting from the 2014/15 season (with each season running from September to August), with the 2018/19 baseline rates of respiratory mortality per 100,000 individuals being lower by 12.41 (95% CI (10.6,14.2)) compared to the 2010-2014 period.
Conclusions. While improvement in care might have contributed to the reduction in the rates of respiratory mortality not associated with influenza in Russia, the above temporally consistent reduction is compatible with the gradual replacement of vaccine serotypes in the transmission and carriage of S. pneumoniae following the introduction of PCV13. Further work is needed to better understand the impact of PCV13 on the epidemiology of respiratory infections and related mortality in Russia.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019372v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019372v1.full.pdf","2020-01-30","Epidemiology

"Quantifying the Dynamics of Migration after a Disaster: Impact of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico","Population displacement may occur after natural disasters, permanently altering the demographic composition of the affected regions. Measuring this displacement is vital for both optimal post-disaster resource allocation and calculation of measures of public health interest such as mortality estimates. Here, we analyzed data generated by mobile phones and social media to estimate the weekly island-wide population at risk and within-island geographic heterogeneity of migration in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. We compared these two data sources to population estimates derived from air travel records and census data. We observed a loss of population across all data sources throughout the study period, however, the magnitude and dynamics differ by data source. Census data predict a population loss of just over 129,000 from July 17 to July 2018, a 4% decrease; air travel data predicts a population loss of 168,295 for the same period of time, a 5% decrease; mobile phone based estimates predicts a loss of 235,375 form July 2017 to May 2018, an 8% decrease; and social media based estimates predict a loss of 476,779 from August 2017 to August 2018; a 17% decrease. On average, municipalities with smaller population size lost a bigger proportion of their population. Moreover, we infer that these municipalities experienced greater infrastructure damage as measured by the proportion of unknown locations stemming from these regions. Finally, our analysis measures a general shift of population from rural to urban centers within the island.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019315v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019315v1.full.pdf","2020-01-30","Epidemiology

"Incidence and Risk Factors of Second Primary Cancer after the Initial Primary Human Papillomavirus Related Neoplasms","Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers are nowadays associated with better survival. However, comprehensive studies in second primary cancer (SPC) after the initial primary HPV-related cancer still remain warranted. Therefore, this study was designed to analyse the incidence and risk factors of SPC after HPV-related cancer.
Methods: We identified 86,790 patients diagnosed with initial primary HPV-related cancer between 1973 and 2010 in the National Cancer Institutes Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 9 database. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and cumulative incidence were calculated to assess the risk of SPC after HPV-related cancer. Subdistribution hazard regression was also conducted to figure out the risk factors.
Results: SIR of SPC after HPV-related cancer was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.55-1.65) for male and 1.25 (95% CI 1.22-1.28) for female. SIR of second primary HPV-related cancer (7.39 [95% CI 6.26-8.68] male and 4.35 [95% CI 4.04-4.67] female) was obviously higher than that of second primary HPV-unrelated cancer (1.54 [95% CI 1.49-1.60] male and 1.16 [95% CI 1.13-1.19] female). 5-year cumulative incidence of SPC was 7.22% (95% CI 6.89%-7.55%) for male and 3.72% (95% CI 3.58%-3.88%) for female. Risk factors of SPC included being married and initial primary cancer (IPC) diagnosed at earlier stage for both gender, and IPC diagnosed at older age as well as surgery performed for female only.
Conclusion: Patients diagnosed with HPV-related cancer are more likely to develop another primary cancer, as compared with the age-specific reference population. Patients with the risk factors claimed in this study are suggested to screen for SPC regularly. According to the elevation of SIR of HPV-related SPC, it is suggested that part of the HPV-related SPC cases may be caused by the persistent infection of HPV.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.19004507v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.19004507v1.full.pdf","2020-01-30","Oncology

Here, we use ground, rail and air travel data to estimate the probability that 2019-nCoV cases were imported from Wuhan to 370 cities throughout China in the three weeks prior to the quarantine. Based on an estimated R0 of 2.56 [95% CI: 2.09, 2.78], we find that the probability of a pre-quarantine introduction exceeds 50% in 131 [95% CI 72, 232] cities, including six cities with populations over two million people with no reported cases as of January 27th.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019299v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019299v1.full.pdf","2020-01-30","Epidemiology

"Estimated effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent international spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)","Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) following its recent emergence. Here, we analyze the expected impact of different travel screening programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss around half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019224v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019224v1.full.pdf","2020-01-30","Epidemiology

"Spatial and epidemiological drivers of P. falciparum malaria among adults in the Democratic Republic of the Congo","Background: Malaria remains a significant public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Adults are frequently infected and may serve as a reservoir for further transmission, yet we know relatively little about risk factors for adult infections. In this study, we assessed malaria risk factors amongst adults using samples from the nationally representative, cross-sectional 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We further explored differences in risk factors by urbanicity.
Methods: Plasmodium falciparum infection was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Covariates were drawn from the DHS to model individual, community, and environmental level risk factors for infection. Additionally, we used deep sequencing data to estimate the community-level proportions of drug resistant infections and included these estimates as potential risk factors. All identified factors were assessed for differences in associations by urbanicity.
Results: A total of 16,126 adults were included. Overall prevalence of malaria was 30.3% (SE = 1.1) by PCR; province-level prevalence ranged from 6.7-58.3%. Only 17% of individuals lived in households with at least one bednet for every two people, as recommended by the World Health Organization. Protective factors included increasing within-household bednet coverage (PR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.76 - 0.95) and modern housing (PR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.49 - 0.69). Community level protective factors included: increased average education and wealth (PR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.65-0.91; PR - 0.84, 95% CI = 0.80 - 0.89). Education, wealth, and modern housing showed protective associations in cities but not in rural areas. 
Conclusions: The DRC continues to suffer from a high burden of malaria; interventions that target high-risk groups and sustained investment in malaria control are sorely needed. Differences in risk factors by urbanicity may be due to differences in transmission intensity or access to resources.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20018978v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20018978v1.full.pdf","2020-01-30","Epidemiology

"A Genetics-First Approach to Dissecting the Heterogeneity of Autism: Phenotypic Comparison of Autism Risk Copy Number Variants","Objective: Certain copy number variants (CNVs) greatly increase risk of autism. We conducted a genetics-first study to investigate whether heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of autism is underpinned by specific genotype-phenotype relationships.
Methods: This international study included 566 children (12.3 years (SD=4.2), 51% male) who were ascertained on the basis of having a genetic diagnosis of a rare CNV associated with high risk of autism (83 16p11.2 deletion carriers, 50 16p11.2 duplication carriers, 380 22q11.2 deletion carriers and 53 22q11.2 duplication carriers), as well as 2027 children (9.1 years (SD=4.9), 87% male) with autism of heterogeneous aetiology. The Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and IQ testing were conducted. 
Results: The four genetic variant groups differed in autism severity, autism subdomain profile as well as IQ profile. However, we found substantial variability in phenotypic outcome within individual genetic variant groups (75% to 96% of the variance depending on the trait), whereas variability between groups was low (1% to 21% depending on trait). We compared CNV carriers who met autism criteria, to children with heterogeneous autism, and a range of profile differences were identified. Using clinical cut-offs, we found that 54% of children with one of the 4CNVs who did not meet full autism diagnostic criteria nonetheless had elevated levels of autistic traits.
Conclusion: Many CNV carriers do not meet full diagnostic criteria for autism, but nevertheless meet clinical cut-offs for autistic traits. Although we find profile differences between variants, there is considerable variability in clinical symptoms within the same variant.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.20017426v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.20017426v2.full.pdf","2020-01-31","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Step-downs reduce workers compensation payments to encourage return to work. Are they effective?","Objective:
To determine whether step-downs, which cut the rate of compensation paid to injured workers after they have been on benefits for several months, are effective as a return to work incentive.
Methods:
We aggregated administrative claims data from eight Australian workers compensation systems to calculate weekly scheme exit rates, a proxy for return to work. Jurisdictions were further subdivided into four injury subgroups: fractures, musculoskeletal, mental health, and other trauma. The effect of step-downs on scheme exit was tested using a regression discontinuity design. Results were pooled into meta-analyses to calculate combined effects and the proportion of variance attributable to heterogeneity.
Results:
The combined effect of step-downs was a 0.86 percentage point (95% CI -1.45 to -0.27) reduction in the exit rate, with significant heterogeneity between jurisdictions (I2 = 68%, p = .003). Neither timing nor magnitude of step-downs was a significant moderator of effects. Within injury subgroups, only fractures had a significant combined effect (-0.84, 95% CI -1.61 to -0.07). Sensitivity analysis indicated potential effects within mental health and musculoskeletal conditions as well.
Conclusions:
The results suggest some workers compensation recipients anticipate step-downs exit early to avoid the reduction in income. However, the effects were small and suggest step-downs have marginal practical significance. We conclude that step-downs are generally ineffective as a return to work policy initiative.","/content/10.1101/19012286v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012286v2.full.pdf","2020-01-31","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Early dynamics of transmission and control of 2019-nCoV: a mathematical modelling study","An outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has led to 7818 cases as of 30th January 2020. Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection is crucial for evaluating the likely effectiveness of control measures and potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases 2019-nCoV in Wuhan and exported cases originating in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time and the likely prevalence of symptomatic cases in the city as of 23rd January 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases would generate outbreaks in other areas. We estimated that the median reproduction number, R, fluctuated between 1.6-2.9 from mid-December to mid-January 2020. We found that the US, Australia and France had more confirmed cases with travel history to Wuhan than the model predicted, and estimated that there were 29,500 (14,300-85,700) prevalent symptomatic cases in Wuhan on 23rd January 2020, when travel restrictions were introduced. Based on our estimates of R, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan, once there are more than three introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Our results show that 2019-nCoV has substantial potential for ongoing human-to-human transmission, and exported cases from Wuhan may have increased prior to travel restrictions being introduced on 23rd January 2020.

"Early evaluation of the Wuhan City travel restrictions in response to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak","An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first reported in China and has spread worldwide. On January 23rd 2020 China shut down transit in and out of Wuhan, a major transport hub and conurbation of 11 million inhabitants, to contain the outbreak. By combining epidemiological and human mobility data we find that the travel ban slowed the dispersal of nCoV from Wuhan to other cities in China by 2.91 days (95% CI: 2.54-3.29). This delay provided time to establish and reinforce other control measures that are essential to halt the epidemic. The ongoing dissemination of 2019-nCoV provides an opportunity to examine how travel restrictions impede the spatial dispersal of an emerging infectious disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019844v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019844v1.full.pdf","2020-02-02","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Real time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection: Inference using exported cases","The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection who were confirmed in other countries provide a chance to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV in the early stage of epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naive population. As of 24 January 2020, with 23 exported cases, and estimating the growth rate from 8 December 2019 (scenario 1) and using the data since growth of exported cases (scenario 2), the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 5433 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 3883, 7160) and 17780 cases (95% CI: 9646, 28724), respectively. The latest estimates of the cCFR were 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.6) for scenario 1 and 7.7% (95% CI: 4.9-11.3%) for scenario 2, respectively. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.3) and 3.7 (95% CI: 3.1, 4.3) for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on the results, we note that current 2019-nCoV epidemic has a substation potential to cause a pandemic. The proposed approach can provide insights into early risk assessment using only publicly available data.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019547v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019547v1.full.pdf","2020-02-02","Epidemiology

"Transmission and epidemiological characteristics of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-Infected Pneumonia(NCIP):preliminary evidence obtained in comparison with 2003-SARS","[Abstract] Objectives Latest epidemic information of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-Infected Pneumonia (NCIP) was collected and a detailed statistical analysis was carried out to make comparison with 2003-SARS in order to provide scientific reference for the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV. Methods The information of NCIP and 2003-SARS from websites of NHCPRC and the World Health Organization was collected, and then the transmission dynamics of the two kinds of infectious diseases were analyzed. The information of 287 confirmed NCIP patients obtained from the website of health committees of 16 provinces. A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the NCIP epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed NCIP case data. Results The growth rate of new cases and deaths of NCIP were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 287 confirmed NCIP cases aged 9 months to 90 years and the average age was (42.38 15.97) years. The gender ratio (M: F) was 1.35: 1. The numbers of NCIP patients in Wuhan and other inland areas were in line with Y=0.7209 x3-11.97x2+59.129x (R2=0.9858) and Y=2.2169 x3-39.74x2+158.88x (R2=0.9357),respectively, with good fitting effects judging by their R2 values. Conclusions The fatality rate of NCIP is lower than that of 2003-SARS and the cure rate is higher. The age of NCIP patients is mainly concentrated in the 30-50 years old (68.29%). The harm of the first-generation NCIP patients is indeed higher than that of secondary cases.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019836v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019836v1.full.pdf","2020-02-02","Epidemiology

"Reconciling early-outbreak preliminary estimates of the basic reproductive number and its uncertainty: a new framework and applications to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has recently emerged as a global threat. As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have prioritized estimating the basic reproductive number Ro, defined as the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case. While these efforts are extremely valuable, their modeling approaches and the resulting estimates vary widely. Here, we present a framework for comparing different estimates of Ro across a wide range of models by decomposing it into three key quantities (the exponential growth rate r, the mean generation interval G, and the generation-interval dispersion kappa) and apply our framework to early estimates of Ro for the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all three quantities, in particular in the shape of the generation-interval distribution. While rapid response during an outbreak can be valuable, avoiding over-confidence is also important.

authorities require evidence on the effectiveness of control measures such as thermal screening

travellers would not be detected, depending on the incubation period, sensitivity of exit and

"Estimated effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent international spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)","Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) following its recent emergence. Here, we analyze the expected impact of different travel screening programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss around half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019224v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019224v2.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Epidemiology

"Macro-parasite transmission in dynamic seasonal environment: Basic Reproductive Number, endemicity, and control","Seasonality of transmission environment, which includes snail populations and habitats, or human-snail contact patterns, can affect the dynamics of schistosomiasis infection, and control outcomes. Conventional modeling approaches often ignore or oversimplify it by applying 'seasonal mean' formulation. Mathematically, such 'averaging' is justified when model outputs/quantities of interest depend linearly on input variables. That is not generally the case for macroparasite transmission models, where model outputs are nonlinear functions of seasonality fashion. 
Another commonly used approach for Schistosomiasis modeling is a reduction of coupled human-snail system to a single 'human equation', via quasi-stationary snail (intermediate host) dynamics. The basic questions arising from these approaches are whether such 'seasonal averaging' and 'intermediate host reduction' are suitable for highly variable/seasonal environments, and what implications these methods have on models' predictive potential of control interventions.
Here we address these questions by using a combination of mathematical analysis and numerical simulation of two commonly used models for macroparasite transmission, MacDonald (MWB), and stratified worm burden (SWB) snail-human systems. We showed that predictions from 'seasonal averaging' models can depart significantly from those of quasi-stationary models. Typically, seasonality would lower endemicity and sustained infection, vs. stationary system with comparable transmission inputs. Furthermore, discrepancies between the two models ('seasonal' and its 'stationary mean') increase with amplitude (or variance) of seasonality. So sufficiently high variability can render infection unsustainable. Similar discrepancies were observed between coupled and reduced 'single host' models, with reduced model overpredicting sustained endemicity. Seasonal variability of transmission raises the question of optimal control timing. Using dynamic simulation, we show that optimal timing of repeated MDA is about half season past the snail peak, where snail population attains its minimal value. Compared to sub-optimal timing, such strategy can reduce human worm burden by factor 2 after 5-6 rounds of MDA. We also extended our models for dynamic snail populations, which allowed us to study the effect of repeated molluscicide, or combined strategy (MDA + molluscicide). The optimal time for molluscicide alone is the end or the start of season, and combined strategy can give additional reduction, and in some cases lead to elimination.
Overall, reduced sustainability in seasonal environment makes it more amenable to control interventions, compared to stationary environment.","/content/10.1101/19012245v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012245v2.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Distinct single cell gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes correlates with treatment response groups defined by type I interferon in rheumatoid arthritis","Previously, we demonstrated that type I IFN (IFN/a) activity can predict non-response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, we examine the biology of TNFi non-response in monocytes from RA patients. We compared single cell gene expression in purified classical (CL, n=342) and non-classical (NC, n=359) monocytes.  RA patients were grouped according to their pre-TNFi IFN/a activity: those likely to have EULAR no response (non-response group, IFN/a 0 or >1.3, n=9) and those likely to have EULAR moderate or good response (response group, IFN/a > 0 and =1.3, n=6). Major differences in gene expression were apparent in principal component and unsupervised cluster analyses.  CL monocytes from the non-response group were unlikely to express JAK1 and IFI27 (p <0.0001 and p 0.0005, respectively).  In NC monocytes from the same group, expression of IFNAR1, IRF1, TNFA, TLR4 (p =0.0001 for each) and others was enriched. Interestingly, JAK1 expression was absent in CL and NC monocytes from 9 patients. This pattern strongly associated with the non-response IFN/a group, suggesting a major biological difference between JAK1 expressors and non-expressors. The type I IFN activity that was previously found to predict TNFi response associated with changes in gene expression in monocytes that suggest differential IFN pathway activation in RA patients who are either likely to respond or to have no response to TNFi.  This work could suggest mechanisms for TNFi non-response, and potential therapeutic strategies for those patients unlikely to respond to TNFi.","/content/10.1101/19011460v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011460v2.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Rheumatology

"Epidemiological identification of a novel infectious disease in real time: Analysis of the atypical pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, 2019-20","Objective: Virological tests indicate that a novel coronavirus is the most likely explanation for the 2019-20 pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing.

Methods: Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of ten existing pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to ""Disease X"" (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued.

Results: The probability that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 32% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 Jan 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 59%.

Conclusions: We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen. The proposed approach, that uses only routinely-observed non-virological data, can aid ongoing risk assessments even before virological test results become available.

"Hemodynamic modeling of aspirin effects on BOLD responses at 7T","Aspirin is considered a potential confound for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. This is because aspirin affects the synthesis of prostaglandin, a vasoactive mediator centrally involved in neurovascular coupling, a process that underlies the blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) response. Aspirin-induced changes in BOLD signal are a potential confound for fMRI studies of patients (e.g. with cardiovascular conditions or stroke) who receive low-dose aspirin prophylactically and are compared to healthy controls that do not take aspirin. To examine the severity of this potential confound, we combined high field (7 Tesla) MRI during a simple hand movement task with a biophysically informed hemodynamic model. Comparing elderly volunteers with vs. without aspirin medication, we tested for putative effects of low-dose chronic aspirin on the BOLD response. Specifically, we fitted hemodynamic models to BOLD signal time courses from 14 regions of the human motor system and examined whether model parameter estimates were significantly altered by aspirin. While our analyses indicate that hemodynamics differed across regions, consistent with the known regional variability of the BOLD response, we neither found a significant main effect of aspirin (i.e., an average effect across brain regions) nor an expected drugregion interaction. While our sample size is not sufficiently large to rule out small-to-medium global effects of aspirin, we had adequate statistical power for detecting the expected interaction. Altogether, our analysis suggests that low-dose aspirin, as used for prophylactic purposes, does not strongly affect BOLD signals and may not represent a critical confound for fMRI studies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019729v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019729v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Radiology and Imaging

"Exploring the potential for collaborative use of an app-based platform for n-of-1 trials among healthcare professionals that treat patients with insomnia","Background: N-of-1 trials are single patient, multiple crossover, comparative effectiveness experiments. Despite their rating as level 1 evidence, they are not routinely used in clinical medicine to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments.

Objective: We explored the potential for implementing a mobile app-based n-of-1 trial platform for collaborative use by clinicians and patients to support data-driven decisions around the treatment of insomnia. 

Methods: A survey assessing awareness and utilization of n-of-1 trials was administered to healthcare professionals that frequently treat patients with insomnia at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. 1M electronic health records were analyzed to evaluate evidence for a comorbid relationship between insomnia and dementia or Alzheimers disease among a patient population that may benefit from n-of-1 trials for the selection of optimal sleep treatments.  

Results: A total of 45 healthcare professionals completed the survey and were included in the analysis. We found that 64% of healthcare professionals surveyed had not heard of n-of-1 trials. After a brief description of these methods, 75% of healthcare professionals reported that they are likely or highly likely to use an app-based n-of-1 trial at least once in the next year if the service were free and easy to offer to their patients.  

Conclusions: An app-based n-of-1 trials platform might be a valuable tool for clinicians and patients to identify the best treatments for insomnia. Educational interventions that raise awareness and provide training are also likely necessary. The electronic health record (EHR) may help identify eligible patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019927v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019927v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Health Informatics

"Context matters: Contrasting behavioral and residential risk factors for Lyme disease between two high-incidence regions in the Northeastern and Midwestern U.S.","The dynamics of zoonotic vector-borne diseases are determined by a complex set of parameters including human behavior that may vary with socio-ecological contexts. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and the Northeast and upper Midwest are the regions most affected - two areas with differing levels of urbanization and sociocultural settings. The probability of being diagnosed with Lyme disease is related to the risk of encounters with an infected blacklegged tick, which reflects both the environmental tick hazard and human behaviors. Herein, we compare behavioral and peridomestic risk factors associated with human-tick encounters between high-incidence states in the Northeast (New York and New Jersey) and Midwest (Wisconsin) of the United States. We used a smartphone application, The Tick App, as a novel survey tool, during spring and summer of 2018. Adaptive human behavior was identified in the relationship between outdoor activities and the use of preventive methods. More frequent recreational outdoor activities and gardening (a peridomestic activity) were associated with an increased likelihood of using personal protective measures. Weekly participation in non-seasonal recreational and peridomestic outdoor activities in spring and summer was associated with an increased likelihood of finding a tick in the fall or winter. Most outdoor activities were more frequently reported by participants from the Midwest than the Northeast. Participants in the Northeast reported less use of personal protective measures, but they reported more interventions to reduce the presence of peridomestic deer and ticks (i.e. pesticide applications on their property) than participants in the Midwest. Participants from the Midwest were more likely to kill rodents on their property. Context mattered, and our study illustrates the need for the assessment of personal behavior and tick exposure in these two Lyme disease-endemic regions to aid in targeted public health messaging to reduce tick-borne diseases.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019810v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019810v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Epidemiology

We collected oral swabs and at least one pancreatic tissue or intestinal samples from 52 subjects, and characterized 16S ribosomal RNA genes using high-throughput DNA sequencing in a total 324 samples. We identified a total of 73 unique Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) that were shared between oral and pancreatic or intestinal samples. Accounting for pairing and within-subject correlation, 7 ASVs showed significant concordance (Kappa statistics) and 5 ASVs exhibited significant or marginally significant Pairwise Stratified Association (PASTA) between oral samples and pancreatic tissue or intestinal samples. Of these, two specific bacterial species (Gemella morbillorum and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii) showed consistent presence or absence patterns between oral and intestinal or pancreatic samples. Lastly, our microbial co-abundance analyses showed several distinct ASVs clusters and complex correlation-networks between ASV clusters in buccal, saliva, duodenum, jejunum, and pancreatic tumor samples. Toghether, our findings suggest that oral, intestinal, and pancreatic microbiomes are correlated and bacteria of oral origin exhibit co-abundance relationships and demonstrate complex correlation patterns in the intestinal and pancreatic tumor samples. Future prospective studies should aim to uncover the co-abundance of specific microbial communities for studying etiology of microbiota-driven carcinogenesis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019752v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019752v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Epidemiology

"The impact of brain lesion characteristics and the corticospinal tract wiring pattern on mirror movement characteristics in unilateral cerebral palsy","Background. Mirror movements (MM) influence bimanual performance in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP). Whilst MM are related to brain lesion characteristics and the corticospinal tract (CST) wiring pattern, the combined impact of these neurological factors remains unknown.
Objective. To investigate the combined impact of neurological factors on MM.  
Methods. Forty-nine children with uCP (mean age 10y6mo) performed a repetitive squeezing task to quantify similarity between MM activity (MM-similarity) and strength of the MM activity (MM-intensity). We used MRI to evaluate lesion type (periventricular white matter, N=30) cortico-subcortical, N=19), the extent of ipsilesional damage and damage to basal ganglia, thalamus and corpus callosum. The CST wiring pattern (17 CSTcontralateral, 16 CSTipsilateral, 16 CSTbilateral) was assessed with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Data was analyzed with simple and multiple regression analyses. 
Results. MM-similarity in the more-affected hand was higher with more damage to the corpus callosum. MM-intensity was higher in children with CSTcontralateral with damage to the basal ganglia and thalamus. In the less-affected hand, MM-similarity was explained by the interaction between lesion type and CST wiring pattern, with higher MM-similarity in children with cortico-subcortical lesions in the CSTcontralateral group. MM-intensity was higher with larger damage to the corpus callosum and unilateral lesions. 
Conclusions. A complex combination of neurological factors influences MM characteristics and the mechanisms differ between hands.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019893v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019893v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Initiation of smoking and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes: a mendelian randomization study","Objectives: To evaluate the association between smoking behavior and type 2 diabetes risk using genetic data. Research Design and Methods: We obtained summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) related to smoking behavior (n=1.2 million people) and type 2 diabetes (n=898,130) in individuals of European ancestry. Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using these summary-level statistics. Specifically, we assessed if genetically determined smoking initiation, smoking cessation, and smoking heaviness (number of cigarettes per day) modulated susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Results: We observed that for each 2-fold increased odds of initiating smoking behavior corresponded with a 21% increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.18-1.24, P=1x10-12). Our effect was consistent across instrumental variable methodological approaches, and we did not observe evidence of systematic biases to our effect estimate. When analyzed using an analogous approach, we found that the effect of smoking initiation increasing diabetes risk was equivalent to the effect of smoking behavior on increase coronary artery disease, an established causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: Genetic data supports the hypothesis that smoking initiation corresponds with increased risk for type 2 diabetes. These findings are consistent with previous clinical epidemiological association between smoking behavior and elevated type 2 diabetes risk. Individual-level MR studies are necessary to estimate mediators and confounders related to this association.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019737v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019737v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Grip strength is associated with retinal and choroidal thickness in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients without retinopathy","Abstract
Objective: To determine the relationship between grip strength and retinal or choroidal thickness in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Design: Observational study-cross-sectional design.
Setting and Participants: The study was conducted among diabetes patients without retinopathy registered in the community health system in Guangzhou, China. 
Measures: Grip strength was measured twice for each hand with a dynamometer in kilograms (kg). The retinal and choroidal thickness in macular Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) sectors were measured by commercial swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT; DRI OCT-2 Triton; Topcon, Tokyo, Japan). 
Results: A total of 1,029 patients were included in the study. Both retinal thickness and choroidal thickness increased with the higher quartile of grip strength. Regression analyses indicated that the average retinal and choroidal thickness increased by 0.14 m (95%CI: 0.03-0.25 m, P=0.011) and 0.57 m (95%CI: 0.03-1.11 m, P=0.037) for each additional kg of grip strength following adjustment for age and gender. Further adjustments were made for axial length, HbA1c, length of time the patient had diabetes, insulin usage, height, weight and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which resulted in an average retinal and choroidal thickness increase of 0.13 m (95%CI: 0.02-0.24 m, P=0.024) and 0.65 m (95%CI: 0.13-1.16 m, P=0.013) for each additional kg of grip strength. Consistent results were obtained in the analyses in ETDRS 9 sectors.
Conclusion: Greater hand grip strength was found to be significantly associated with thicker retinal and choroidal layers in diabetic patients. Grip strength may provide a useful indicator of retinal health in diabetic patients. Further studies are needed to determine directionality and causality, and to examine whether improving muscle strength has a positive effect on retinal and choroidal thickness.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019885v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019885v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Ophthalmology

"Dysregulated lipid metabolism precedes onset of psychosis in people at clinical high risk","A key clinical challenge in the management of individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) is that it is difficult to predict their future clinical outcomes. Here, we investigated if the levels of circulating molecular lipids are related to adverse clinical outcomes in this group. Serum lipidomic analysis was performed in 263 CHR individuals and 51 healthy controls (HC), who were then clinically monitored for up to five years. Machine learning was used to identify lipid profiles that discriminated between CHR subjects and HC, and between subgroups of CHR subjects with distinct clinical outcomes. At baseline, compared to HC, CHR subjects (independent of outcome) had higher levels of triacylglycerols (TGs) with a low acyl carbon number and a double bond count, as well as higher levels of lipids in general. CHR subjects who subsequently developed psychosis (n=50) were distinguished from those that did not (n=213) on the basis of lipid profile at baseline, using a model with an AUC = 0.81 (95% CI = 0.69-0.93). CHR subjects who became psychotic had lower levels of ether phospholipids than CHR individuals who did not (p<0.01). Collectively, these data suggest that lipidomic abnormalities predate the onset of psychosis, and that blood lipidomic measures may be useful in predicting which CHR individuals are most likely to develop psychosis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019851v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019851v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Circulating lipids associate with future weight gain in individuals with an at-risk mental state and in first-episode psychosis","Patients with schizophrenia have a lower than average life span, largely due to the increased prevalence of cardiometabolic co-morbidities. Identification of individuals with psychotic disorders with a high risk of rapid weight gain, and the associated development of metabolic complications, is an unmet need as regards public health. Here, we applied mass spectrometry-based lipidomics in a prospective study comprising 48 controls (CTR), 44 first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients and 22 individuals at clinical-high-risk (CHR) for psychosis, from two study centers (Turku/Finland and London/UK). Baseline serum samples were analyzed by lipidomics, while body mass index (BMI) was assessed at baseline and after 12 months. We found that baseline triacylglycerols with low double bond counts and carbon numbers were positively associated with the change in BMI at follow-up. In addition, a molecular signature comprised of two triacylglycerols (TG(48:0) and TG(45:0)), was predictive of weight gain in individuals with a psychotic disorder, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.60-0.85). When independently tested in the CHR group, this molecular signature predicted said weight change with AUROC = 0.73 (95% CI: 0.61-0.83). We conclude that molecular lipids may serve as a predictor of weight gain in psychotic disorders in at-risk individuals, and may thus provide a useful marker for identifying individuals who are most prone to developing cardiometabolic co-morbidities.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019711v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019711v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Efficacy of Ultrasound-Guided Erector Spinae Plane Block for Perioperative Pain Control and Short-Term Outcomes in Lumbar Laminoplasty","Background: Erector spinae plane (ESP) block has been reported to provide analgesia in spine surgery in case reports or case series, and there have been no controlled studies to date evaluating its efficacy. We aimed to exam the roles of ESP block in lumbar surgery in a single center randomized control trial by injecting local analgesic into the interfacial plane between the erector spinae muscles and the transverse process under ultrasound guidance.
Methods: Consecutive elective lumbar surgery patients were randomized into either a control group (general anesthesia only, Group G, N=32) or a treatment group (general anesthesia plus ESP block, Group E, N=30). Several parameters including visual analog scale (VAS, primary outcome), perioperative anesthetics and analgesics usage, indexes of hemodynamics variation, return of bowel function and overall benefit of analgesia score (OBAS) were measured. 
Results: Significant differences in VAS scores over time were found between the two matched groups (P = 0.010). Group E patients had significantly lower pain scores than Group G patients in the early postoperative period within the first 6 hr. Group G and Group E VAS scores peaked at 1 hr and 12 hr, respectively, and the peak pain score in Group G is significantly higher than that of Group E (P = 0.002). In addition, patients who received ESP block had lower perioperative analgesic and sedative medication requirements, improved satisfaction with pain management, more stable hemodynamics, and earlier bowel function return than those using general anesthesia alone.
Conclusion: Pre-incision bilateral single injection ESP blocks provided effective analgesia perioperatively during lumbar laminoplasty, decreased perioperative anesthesia and analgesia requirement, and accelerated short-term recovery.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019745v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019745v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Anesthesia

"Apolipoprotein E genotype, lifestyle and coronary artery disease: gene-environment interaction analyses in the UK Biobank population","Introduction: Carriers of the APOE <U+03F5>4 genotype have an increased risk for developing coronary artery disease (CAD), but there is preliminary evidence that lifestyle factors interact with APOE genotype on CAD risk. Here, we assessed the interactions of physical activity, oily fish intake and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake with APOE genotype on risk of incident cardiovascular disease in a large population of middle-aged individuals. 
Methods: The present study was embedded in the UK Biobank population and comprised 344,092 European participants (mean age: 56.5 years, 45.7% men) without a history of CAD. Information regarding physical activity, oily fish intake and PUFA intake was collected through questionnaires, and information on incident CAD through linkage with hospital admission records. Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age and sex. 
Results: A higher physical activity level and a higher intake of oily fish were associated with a lower incidence of CAD. These associations were similar across all APOE isoform groups (p-values for interaction > 0.05). A higher PUFA intake was only associated with a lower CAD risk in APOE e4 carriers (hazard ratio: 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.62,0.90), however, no statistically significant interaction was observed (p-valueinteraction = 0.137). 
Conclusion: While higher physical activity, fish intake and PUFA intake all decreased the risk of CAD, no evidence for interaction of these lifestyle factors with APOE genotype was observed in UK Biobank participants. Interventions intended to reduce cardiovascular risk might therefore be similarly effective across the APOE isoform carriers.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019620v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019620v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Status of water sources, hygiene and sanitation and its impact on the health of households of Makwane Village, Limpopo Province, South Africa","The key to reducing or even eradicating the burden of waterborne diseases is through appropriate sanitation facilities and piped water systems. Installation of centralised system may take decades to be established, especially in impoverished rural communities of African countries. A survey of 88 households representing Makwane, a scattered settlement in South Africa, Limpopo Province, was conducted to assess the status of basic services. A questionnaire was designed to obtain the required information, such as improved water sources, improved sanitation facilities, hygiene practices and incidence of diarrhoeal diseases in the community. A house-to-house survey was conducted from July to August in 2014 and data were collected from the heads of each household. Results of the survey revealed a complete absence of improved drinking water sources in the community (100%). People rely on any available water sources such stream water, or on rainwater harvesting. Safe hygiene practices were observed in most households with regards to water storage as they store water in 25 L plastic buckets (57%), vessels stored inside a room (76%), use storage containers covered with a lid (76%) and wash these containers at any time prior to storing water (39%). Results also indicated a high percentage of households not treating water (81%) prior to use, disposing wastewater in the yard (97%), lacking access to improved sanitation facilities (41%), and not allowing children under 12 years old to use the toilets (62%). As a result, they practise open defecation as an alternative sanitation facility (86%). The main water source for the community was found to be the stream (31%) and this source is used for adequate personal hygiene in terms of full body bath (94%). In terms of health outcomes, the most prevalent health problem was found to be diarrhoea (75%), which occurred mostly in children less than 5 years old and was found to persist up to 3 days (34%). The community generally visited the clinic (75%) in cases of health problems. The implementation of point-of-use household drinking water treatment in Makwane households for the production of safe drinking water is highly recommended. In addition to this, a special education with emphasis on drinking water storage, cleaning of water storage containers and safe disposal of wastewater should be offered. Open defecation should also be discouraged to mitigate the bacterial contamination of water sources and transmission of diseases.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019679v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019679v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Epidemiology

"Quantitatively Evaluating the Cross-Sectoral and One Health Impact of Interventions: A Scoping Review and Application to Antibiotic Resistance","Current published guidance on how to evaluate antibiotic resistance (ABR) from a One Health perspective has focussed on the evaluation of intervention design and of the implementation process.  For efficient resource allocation, it is also important to consider quantitative measures of intervention impact. In particular, there has been little discussion of how to practically evaluate ABR-related agri- and aquaculture interventions from a public health perspective.  Lessons can be learned from other One Health and cross-sectoral intervention impact evaluations. WebofScience, EconLit, PubMed and grey literature were searched for literature quantitatively evaluating interventions across humans, animals and/or the environment. The review included 90 studies: 73 individual evaluations (from 72 papers) and 18 reviews, all including some measure of human impact, but only 29 papers covered all three One Health perspectives (human, animal and environmental). To provide decision makers with expected outcome estimates that are related to their objective, evaluations should provide outcome estimates from multiple different perspectives; individual, microeconomic and/or macroeconomic perspectives across the One Health system should be taken into account. Based on the methods found in this review, a multi-level compartmental modelling approach for ABR-related intervention evaluation is proposed. The outcomes of such models can then feed into multi-criteria-decision analyses that weigh outcomes alongside other chosen outcome estimates (for example equity or uncertainty). It is key that future quantitative evaluation models on ABR-related interventions are shared (for example through open source code sharing websites) to avoid duplication of effort and to enable more comprehensive estimates of intervention impact to be modelled in the future.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019703v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019703v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Health Economics

"Direct Measurement of Rates of Asymptomatic Infection and Clinical Care-Seeking for Seasonal Coronavirus","The pandemic potential of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China, during December 2019 is strongly tied to the number and contagiousness of undocumented human infections. Here we present findings from a proactive longitudinal sampling study of acute viral respiratory infections that documents rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care seeking for seasonal coronavirus.  We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms.  These numbers indicate that a very high percentage of seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for understanding the spread of the emergent nCoV.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019612v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019612v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"High Risk Infants who are Low Dose Tolerant after Peanut Oral Food Challenges","Background: Early peanut (PN) introduction may prevent peanut allergy in at-risk children. Little data exists regarding early introduction for infants with large skin prick tests (SPT) or high peanut IgE levels, who are not often offered oral food challenges (OFC). 
Objective: To retrospectively assess tolerance of a low dose (1 gram) of peanut in infants at risk for peanut allergy, including highest-risk infants (HRI) with SPT wheal >7mm.
Methods: We reviewed PN OFCs performed over a two-year period at our pediatric allergy center. Low-dose PN OFC was offered to all infants considered at risk for PN allergy, regardless of peanut SPT or IgE results. Dosing was escalated after OFC at home.
Results: Of infants with SPT wheal <=4 mm (n=30), 29 (97%) were low-dose-tolerant. Of those with SPT >4 mm (n=40), 25 (63%) were low-dose-tolerant, and Ara h2 IgE was significantly lower compared to non-tolerant individuals (median 0.62 versus 6.49 kU/L, p<0.05). Among HRI with SPT >7mm (n=22), 12 (55%) were tolerant, with median SPT 9mm (range 8-11mm), PN-IgE 1.1 kU/L (0.3-10.7 kU/L) and Ara h2 1.6 kU/L (0-9.57 kU/L). Age, sex, race, eczema, and egg sensitization did not affect tolerance regardless of SPT size. After 3-6 months, most infants tolerant at OFC were gradually able to consume larger doses of PN.
Conclusion: Many infants with PN-SPT >4mm are tolerant of low-dose peanut, and Ara h 2 IgE may be predictive for clinical tolerance among these infants. Low-dose PN-OFC with gradual updosing may help prevent PN allergy in a greater number of at-risk infants.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019570v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019570v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Allergy and Immunology

"Blood Levels of NLRP3 Inflammasome Components are Associated with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder","Background: Inflammation has a well-known role in the pathogenesis of a range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Previous studies provided evidence regarding its possible involvement in the etiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, mechanisms explaining the association of inflammation with OCD are lacking. The NLRP3 inflammasome complex initiates and mediates inflammatory response, which explain one of the most important key mechanisms behind inflammatory response. In this study, we aimed to determine a possible association between NLRP3 inflammasome and OCD, and to evaluate its relationship with clinical features.
Methods: This case-control study included 103 participants (51 OCD and 52 healthy controls). OCD patients were diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. All participants were evaluated by psychiatric inventories, i.e. Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, and Hewitt Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from fresh blood samples. RNA and protein were extracted from PBMCs and expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting. Serum IL-1beta and IL-18 cytokine levels were determined by ELISA. 
Results: NEK7 and CASP1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in OCD patients, compared to controls. Pro-Caspase-1 protein levels were elevated, as well. Regression analysis showed that NEK7 mRNA and Caspase-1 protein levels can differentiate OCD and healthy control groups. 
Discussion: pro-Caspase-1 mRNA and protein levels in PBMCs, as well as NEK7 mRNA levels are potential biomarker candidates in OCD. Our results may prompt research into possible role of NLRP3 inflammasome in OCD etiology.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019646v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019646v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Is mammography screening beneficial: An individual-based stochastic model for breast cancer incidence and mortality","The benefits of mammography screening have been controversial, with conflicting findings from various studies. We hypothesize that unmeasured heterogeneity in tumor aggressiveness underlies these conflicting results. Based on published data from the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (CNBSS), we develop and parameterize an individual-based mechanistic model for breast cancer incidence and mortality that tracks five stages of breast cancer progression and incorporates the effects of age on breast cancer incidence and all-cause mortality. The model accurately reproduces the reported outcomes of the CNBSS. By varying parameters, we predict that the benefits of mammography depend on the effectiveness of cancer treatment and tumor. In particular, patients with the most rapidly growing or potentially largest tumors have the highest benefit and least harm from the screening, with only a relatively small effect of age. However, the model predicts that confining mammography populations with a high risk of acquiring breast cancer increases the screening benefit only slightly compared with the full population.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019596v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019596v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Epidemiology

"Collapsing the list of myocardial infarction-related differential expressed genes into a diagnostic signature","Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most severe manifestations of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the leading cause of death from non-infectious diseases worldwide. It is known that the central component of CAD pathogenesis is a chronic vascular inflammation. However, the mechanisms underlying the changes that occur in T, B and NK lymphocytes, monocytes and other immune cells during CAD and MI are still poorly understood. One of those pathogenic mechanisms might be the dysregulation of intracellular signaling pathways in the immune cells. In the present study we performed a transcriptome profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MI patients and controls. The machine learning algorithm was then used to search for MI-associated signatures, that could reflect the dysregulation of intracellular signaling pathways. The genes ADAP2, KLRC1, MIR21, PDGFD and CD14 were identified as the most important signatures for the classification model with L1-norm penalty function. The classifier output quality was equal to 0.911 by Receiver Operating Characteristic metric on test data. These results were validated on two independent open GEO datasets. Identified MI-associated signatures can be further assisted in MI diagnosis and/or prognosis. Thus, our study presents a pipeline for collapsing the list of differential expressed genes, identified by high-throughput techniques, in order to define disease-associated diagnostic signatures.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019554v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019554v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Amyloid-beta CSF/PET discordance vs tau load 5 years later: It takes two to tangle","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between discordant amyloid-A PET and CSF biomarkers at baseline and the emergence of tau pathology 5 years later. METHODS: We included 730 ADNI participants without dementia (282 cognitively normal, 448 mild cognitive impairment) with baseline [18F]Florbetapir PET and CSF A42 available. Amyloid- CSF/PET status was determined at baseline using established cut-offs. Longitudinal data was available for [18F]florbetapir (A) PET (baseline to 4.31.9 years), CSF (p)tau (baseline to 2.00.1 years), cognition (baseline to 4.32.0 years), and [18F]flortaucipir (tau) PET (measured 5.21.2 years after baseline to 1.60.7 years later). We used linear mixed modelling to study the association between amyloid- CSF/PET status and tau pathology measured in CSF or using PET. Additionally, we calculated the proportion of CSF+/PET- participants who during follow-up (i) progressed to amyloid- CSF+/PET+, and/or (ii) became tau-positive based on [18F]flortaucipir PET. RESULTS: Amyloid- CSF+/PET+ (N=318) participants had elevated CSF (p)tau levels and worse cognitive performance at baseline, while CSF+/PET- (N=80) participants were overall similar to the CSF-/PET- (N=306) group. Five years after baseline, [18F]flortaucipir PET uptake in the CSF+/PET- group (1.200.13) did not differ from CSF-/PET- (1.180.08, p=0.69), but was substantially lower than CSF+/PET+ (1.480.44, p<0.001). Of the CSF+/PET- subjects, 21/64 (33%) progressed to amyloid- CSF+/PET+, whereas only one (3%, difference p<0.05) became tau-positive based on [18F]flortaucipir PET. CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient amyloid- load detectable by both CSF and PET is required before substantial tau deposition emerges. Compared to participants with abnormal amyloid- levels on PET and CSF, the CSF+/PET- group has a distinctly better prognosis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019539v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019539v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Neurology

"A genetic model of ivabradine recapitulates results from randomized clinical trials","Background. Naturally occurring human genetic variants provide a valuable tool to identify drug targets and guide drug prioritization and clinical trial design. Ivabradine is a heart rate lowering drug with protective effects on heart failure despite increasing the risk of atrial fibrillation. In patients with coronary artery disease without heart failure, the drug does not protect against major cardiovascular adverse events prompting questions about the ability of genetics to have predicted those effects. This study evaluates the effect of a mutation in HCN4, ivabradine's drug target, on safety and efficacy endpoints.
Methods. We used genetic association testing and Mendelian randomization to predict the effect of ivabradine and heart rate lowering on cardiovascular outcomes.
Results. Using data from the UK Biobank and large GWAS consortia, we evaluated the effect of a heart rate-reducing genetic variant at the HCN4 locus encoding ivabradine's drug target. These genetic association analyses showed increases in risk for atrial fibrillation (OR 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.13, P=9.3  10-9) in the UK Biobank. In a cause-specific competing risk model to account for the increased risk of atrial fibrillation, the HCN4 variant reduced incident heart failure in participants that did not develop atrial fibrillation (HR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83-0.98, P=0.013).

"Predicting human health from biofluid-based metabolomics using machine learning","Biofluid-based metabolomics enables the profiling of thousands of molecules and has the potential to provide highly accurate, minimally invasive diagnostics for a range of health conditions. However, typical metabolomics studies focus on only a few statistically significant features. We study the applicability of machine learning for health state-prediction across 35 human mass spectrometry-based metabolomics studies. Models trained on all features outperform those using only significant features and frequently provide high predictive performance across nine health states, despite disparate experimental conditions and disease contexts. Combining data from different experimental settings (e.g. sample type, instrument, chromatography) within a study minimally alters predictive performance, suggesting information overlap between different methods. Using only non-significant features, we still often obtain high predictive performance. To facilitate further advances, we provide all data online. This work highlights the applicability of biofluid-based metabolomics with data-driven analysis for health state diagnostics.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019471v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019471v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Health Informatics

"The use of simultaneous SEEG and MEG in localising seizure onset zone","Objectives: Both Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) are used in presurgical epilepsy assessment, with contrasting advantages and limitations. It is not known whether combined recording using both modalities can maintain inherent advantages whilst overcoming these limitations e.g. recording from deep brain sources whilst preserving good spatial resolution. Methods: 24 adult and paediatric patients who underwent SEEG study for pre-surgical evaluation of focal drug-resistant epilepsy, were recorded using simultaneous SEEG-MEG, of which 14 had abnormal interictal activity during recording. The 14 patients were divided into two groups; those with presumed superficial (n=7) and deep (n=7) brain interictal activity. Results: There was no significant difference between SEEG and MEG in identifying superficial spikes (p=0.135) and SEEG was significantly better at detecting deep spikes (p=0.002). Mean distance across patients between SEEG channel with highest average spike amplitude and MEG dipole was 26.6+/-3.6 mm for superficial sources, and 21.5 +/- 2.04 mm for deep sources, even though for some of the latter (n=4) no MEG spikes were detected and MEG dipole was fitted to a SEEG interictal activity triggered average. Removal of MEG dipole was associated with 1 year seizure freedom in 5/6 patients with superficial source, and 4/6 patients with deep source. Conclusions: Although SEEG has greater sensitivity in identifying interictal activity from deeper sources, an MEG source can be localised using SEEG information, thereby providing useful whole brain context to SEEG and potential role in epilepsy surgery planning.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019505v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019505v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Neurology

"Added Value and Clinical Significance of Nonlinear Variability Indices of Walking Stride Interval in Neurodegenerative Diseases","Though self-paced walking is highly stereotyped, the stride interval fluctuates from one stride to the next around an average value with a measurable statistical variability. In clinical gait analysis, this variability is usually assessed with indices such the standard deviation or the coefficient of variation (CV). The aim of this study is to understand the added value that nonlinear indices of walking stride interval variability, such as Hurst exponent (H) and Minkowski fractal dimension (D), can provide in a clinical context and to suggest a clinical significance of these indices in the most common neurodegenerative diseases: Parkinson, Huntington, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although evidence have been accumulated that the stride interval organization at long range displays a more random, less autocorrelated, gait pattern in neurodegenerative diseases compared with young healthy individuals, it is today necessary to recompute CV, H, and D indices in a unified way and to take into account aging impact on these indices. In fact, computed nonlinear indices of variability are mainly dependent on stride interval time series length and algorithms used, making quantitative comparisons between different studies difficult or even impossible. Here, we recompute these indices from available stride interval time series, either coming from our lab or from online databases, or made available to us by the authors of previously conducted research. We confirm that both linear and nonlinear variability indices are relevant indicators of aging process and neurodegenerative diseases. CV is sensitive to aging process and pathology but does not allow to discriminate between specific neurodegenerative diseases. D shows no significative change in pathological groups. However, since H index is correlated with Hoehn & Yahr scores and significantly lowered in patients suffering from Huntington's disease, we recommend it as a relevant supplement to CV.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019455v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019455v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Neurology

"From sequence data to patient result: a solution for HIV drug resistance genotyping with Exatype, end to end software for Pol-HIV-1 Sequence analysis and patient HIV drug resistance result generation","Introduction: With the rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to treat HIV infection, there are ongoing concerns regarding probable emergence and transmission of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) mutations. This scaleup has to lead to an increased need for routine HIVDR testing to inform the clinical decision on a regimen switch. Although the majority of wet laboratory processes are standardized, slow, labor intensive data transfer and subjective manual sequence interpretation steps are still required to finalize and release patient results. We thus set out to validate the applicability of a software package to generate HIVDR patient results from raw sequence data independently.
Methods: We assessed the performance characteristics of Hyrax Bioscience Exatype (a sequence data to patient result, fully automated sequence analysis software, which consolidates RECall, MEGA X and the Stanford HIV database) against the standard method (RECall and Stanford database). Exatype is a web-based HIV Drug resistance bioinformatic pipeline available at sanger.exatype.com. To validate the exatype, we used a test set of 135 remnant HIV viral load samples at the National HIV Reference Laboratory (NHRL).
Result: We analyzed, and successfully generated results of 126 sequences out of 135 specimens by both standard and Exatype software. Result production using Exatype required minimal hands-on time in comparison to the standard (6 computation-hours using the standard method versus 1.5 Exatype computation-hours). Concordance between the two systems was 99.8% for 311,227 bases compared. 99.7 % of the 0.2% discordant bases, were attributed to nucleotide mixtures as a result of the sequence editing in Recall. Both methods identified similar (99.1%) critical antiretroviral resistance-associated mutations resulting in a 99.2% concordance of resistance susceptibility interpretations. Base calling comparison between the two methods had Cohen kappa (0.97 to 0.99) implying an almost perfect agreement with minimal base calling variation. On a predefined dataset, RECall editing displayed the highest probability to score mixtures accurately one vs. 0.71 and the lowest chance to inaccurately assign mixtures to pure nucleotides (0.002 to 0.0008). This advantage is attributable to the manual sequence editing in RECall.
Conclusion: The reduction in hands-on time needed is a benefit when using the Exatype HIV DR sequence analysis platform and result generation tool. There is a minimal difference in base calling between Exatype and standard methods. Although the discrepancy has minimal impact on drug resistance interpretation, allowance of sequence editing in Exatype as RECall can significantly improve its performance.

"Improving Esophageal Protection during AF ablation: the IMPACT study.","Background: Thermal injury to the esophagus is a known complication of ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) and accounts for most procedure-related mortality. Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen by infusing cold liquid can reduce thermal injury to a limited extent. 

Objective: To investigate the ability of a powerful temperature control device to protect the esophagus from ablation-related thermal injury.

Methods: A single-center, prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial was used to investigate the ability of the ensoETM device to protect the esophagus from thermal injury. This method was compared in a 1:1 randomization to a control group of standard practice utilizing a single-point temperature probe. In the study group, the device was used to keep the luminal temperature at 4 degrees during radiofrequency (RF) ablation for AF. Endoscopic examination was performed at 7 days post-ablation and esophageal injury was scored. The patient and the endoscopist were blinded to the randomization.

Results: We recruited 188 patients, of whom 120 underwent endoscopy. Thermal injury to the mucosa was significantly more common in the control group than in those receiving esophageal protection (12/60 versus 2/60; P=0.008), with a trend toward reduction in gastroparesis (6/60 Vs 2/60, p=0.27). There was no difference between groups in RF duration, force, power and combined ablation index (P value range= 0.2-0.9). Procedure duration and fluoroscopy duration were similar (P=0.97, P=0.91 respectively). 

Conclusion: Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen significantly reduces ablation-related thermal injury compared to standard care. This method of esophageal protection is safe and does not compromise the efficacy of the ablation procedure.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019158v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019158v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Cardiovascular Medicine

"DNA methylation aging clocks and pancreatic cancer risk: Pooled analysis of three prospective nested case-control studies","Background: Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030 in the United States. DNA methylation (DNAm) age may reflect age-related variations in the biological changes and abnormalities related to cancer development.  
Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis using prediagnostic blood samples of pancreatic cancer cases and matched controls selected from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Physician's Health Study (PHS), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). We used three DNAm aging clocks (Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge) to estimate subjects' DNAm age, epigenetic age acceleration (AA) and intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA) metrics. We performed conditional logistic regression and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression to examine associations between six AA and IEAA metrics and risk of pancreatic cancer and survival, respectively. 
Results: A total of 393 incidence pancreatic cancer cases and 431 matched controls from the NHS, PHS, and HPFS cohorts were included in this analysis. The medians of all three epigenetic AA and three IEAA metrics were consistently above zero (indicating accelerated age) among cases, while they were below zero (indicating decelerated age) among the matched controls. Comparing participants in the highest quartile of age acceleration metrics, the pancreatic cancer risks were significantly increased by 67% to 83% for Hannum and PhenoAge AA or IEAA metrics with minimal of 7- to 9-years accelerated ages. Except for Hovarth AA and IEAA metrics, there were significant dose-response trends, such that higher age accelerations were associated with higher pancreatic cancer risk, but the relationships were nonlinear. Stratified analyses showed heterogeneous associations, varying by participants' characteristics and by epigenetic AA or IEAA metrics. As time to diagnosis increased, the ORs of pancreatic cancer for the Hannum AA and Horvath AA or IEAA metrics trended upwards, while the ORs for the PhenoAge AA or IEAA and Hannum IEAA metrics trended downward. Overall, we observed no significant association between pancreatic cancer survival and any of the prediagnostic epigenetic AA or IEAA metrics.
Conclusion: Our results indicate DNAm age acceleration is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in a nonlinear, dose-response manner. Epigenetic IEAA metrics may be a useful addition to current methods for pancreatic cancer risk prediction.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019174v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019174v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Epidemiology

"Association of the use of hearing aids with the incidence and progression of dementia: A longitudinal retrospective study","Background 

Hearing aid usage has been linked to improvements in cognition, communication, and socialization, but the extent to which it can affect the onset and progression of dementia is unknown. This study leveraged the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set to longitudinally examine the association between the use of hearing aids and risk of progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to dementia as well as progression of dementia in hearing-impaired adults.

Methods

The sample included 977 participants aged >50 with MCI or all-cause dementia enrolled between 2005 and 2018. Participants were classified into four groups according to the definition of the duration of disease stage: Group 1, 450 participants with MCI at baseline that developed dementia during follow up; Group 2, 314 participants diagnosed with dementia at baseline and subsequently died during follow-up; Group 3, 126 healthy participants who were later diagnosed with MCI and then dementia at follow-up; Group 4, 87 participants with MCI at baseline who later converted to dementia and subsequently died during follow-up. Groups 3 and 4 were used to better capture the duration of MCI-to-dementia and dementia-to-death periods. Kaplan-Meier survival functions and survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to assess the effect of hearing aid use on risk of MCI-to-dementia conversion and mortality risk in dementia participants. Sensitivity analyses were performed to control for confounding.

Results

Hearing aid users with MCI showed a reduced risk of developing dementia both in Group 1 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95%CI, 0.45-0.69; false discovery rate [FDR] p <.0001) and Group 3 (HR,0.42; 95%CI, 0.27-0.66; FDR p <.001). The mean progression rate in CDRSB was significantly higher for those who did not use hearing aids (p =.04). Hearing aid usage was also found to influence the progression of dementia. Hearing-aid users with dementia had a lower risk of death, both in Group 2 (HR,0.75; 95%CI, 0.60-0.95; FDR p<U+2009>=.038) and Group 4 (HR,0.53; 95%CI, 0.33-0.89; FDR p<U+2009>=.04). Our findings were robust subject to multiple sensitivity analyses. 

Conclusions 

Among hearing-impaired adults, hearing aid usage was significantly associated with reduced dementia risk and slower disease progression.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.19015503v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.19015503v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Geriatric Medicine

"Deep Learning for pericardial fat extraction and evaluation on a population study","The pericardial fat represents a powerful (promising) index which has been seen to correlate with several cardiovascular events. We propose a novel approach to automatically measure it from CT scans and we seek to explore how it is distributed in a study population. We studied a population of 1528 patients where 47 (3%) showed a cardiac event. The fat segmentation model was based on a deep neural network to identify the heart and from it, the pericardial fat was extract by threshold. Statistical analysis was finally computed to stratify the population according the quantity of pericardial fat. The high segmentation quality was reported with a Dice index (92.5%) and a Pearson coefficient (0.990, p<0.001). Notably, normalized pericardial fat volume was significantly higher in patients with cardiac event (73.4630.84 vs 60.0625.38 cm^3/m^2, p=0.005) with a AUC of 63,44% for discrimination of cardiac event. The proposed approach reached accurate and fast performance for the evaluation of the pericardial fat making it reliable for a population analysis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019109v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019109v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Radiology and Imaging

"Family-based genome-wide association study of leprosy in Vietnam","Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease of the skin and peripheral nerves with a strong genetic predisposition. Recent genome-wide approaches have identified numerous common variants associated with leprosy, almost all in the Chinese population. We conducted the first family-based genome-wide association study of leprosy in 622 affected offspring from Vietnam, followed by replication in an independent sample of 1189 leprosy cases and 671 controls of the same ethnic origin. The most significant results were observed within the HLA region, in which six SNPs displayed genome-wide significant associations, all of which were replicated in the independent case/control sample. We investigated the signal in the HLA region in more detail, by conducting a multivariate analysis on the case/control sample of 319 GWAS-suggestive HLA hits for which evidence for replication was obtained. We identified three independently associated SNPs, two located in the HLA class I region (rs1265048: OR=0.69 [0.58-0.80], combined p-value = 5.53x10-11; and rs114598080: OR=1.47 [1.46-1.48], combined p-value = 8.77x10-13), and one located in the HLA class II region (rs3187964 (OR=1.67 [1.55-1.80], combined p-value = 8.35x10-16). We also validated two previously identified risk factors for leprosy: the missense variant rs3764147 in the LACC1 gene (OR=1.52 [1.41-1.63], combined p-value = 5.06x10-14), and the intergenic variant rs6871626 located close to the IL12B gene (OR=0.73 [0.61-0.84], combined p-value = 6.44x10-8). These results shed new light on the genetic control of leprosy, by dissecting the influence of HLA SNPs, and validating the independent role of two additional variants in a large Vietnamese sample.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20018432v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20018432v1.full.pdf","2020-02-03","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Human-to-human transmission of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)","Background:
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of 2019-nCoV in humans was reported in Wuhan, China. We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to provide evidence of human-to-human transmission.
Methods:
A confirmed case of 2019-nCoV was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of 2019-nCoV in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of the confirmed cases were collected from their medical records. Exposure and travel histories were obtained by interviewing the confirmed cases.
Results:
Seventeen confirmed cases were identified from January 1 to 21, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, two cases (11.8%) arisen locally without travel history to Wuhan or exposure history to wildlife market within 14 days prior to the onset of illness. These two cases were from two family cluster infections including 4 and 2 index cases, respectively. The whole viral genome from the two cases was exactly the same with their index cases, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) which were predicted to cause one amino acid change in spike protein and Orf8 protein, respectively.
Conclusions:
This study identified two human-to-human transmitted cases of 2019-nCoV in Guangdong Province, China, which indicates that prevention strategies of cutting the person-to-person transmission of 2019-nCoV in households, hospitals and communities are urgently implemented.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019141v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019141v1.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Epidemiology

"Interprofessional Learning in Immediate Life Support training improves simulated patient related outcomes.","Aim of the study:
To assess team performance in implementing time critical key interventions during a simulated resuscitation after participating in either an interprofessional-learning (IPL) or uniprofessional-learning (UPL) Immediate Life Support training course (ILS).
Introduction:
Much of the published work on team-based simulation training has measured the lower levels of Kirkpatricks hierarchy of evidence and effectiveness. This study aimed to ascertain if interprofessional team training could improve a higher level of outcome such as behaviour and patient outcomes.
Methods: 
A retrospective quantitative analysis of time critical points in a simulated cardiac arrest resuscitation, from a previous randomised study on the effects of Interprofessional Learning in ILS. The video recordings from the original study consisting of medical (n=48) and nursing (n=48) were analysed to mark when either the IPL or UPL team performed a time critical intervention. 
Results:
Five time-critical points for interventions were identified; confirmation of cardiac arrest, commencement of initial CPR, rhythm check, time to 1st shock and delay in restarting CPR. Parametric testing of each of these time-based criteria were subjected to an independent sample t-test with statistically significant findings in three of the five criteria in favour of those who had undertaken the interprofessional learning.
Conclusion: 
Our results demonstrate that through an IPL approach in ILS there was a statistically different improvement in mean times to performing time-critical interventions, which if transferred to the clinical environment could improve and impact on both change of behaviour and patient outcomes in Kirkpatricks higher levels of evidence and effectiveness.
Though this study shows that team behaviour and performing time-critical interventions can improve in the short-term, we acknowledge that further longitudinal studies are required to ascertain the effect of such improvement over time. So that both as researchers and educators we can make healthcare teams work safer and more efficiently to improve patient outcomes.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016170v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19016170v2.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Medical Education

"Comparative Evaluation of CHROMagar COL-APSE, MicroScan Walkaway, ComASPColistin, and Colistin MAC Test in Detecting Colistin-resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria","Colistin has become a critical antibiotic for fatal Gram-negative infections owing to the proliferation of multidrug-resistant carbapenemase-producing bacteria. Thus, cheaper, faster, efficient and easier-to-use colistin diagnostics are required for clinical surveillance, diagnoses and therapeutics. The sensitivity, specificity, major error (ME), very major error (VME), categorial agreement, essential agreement, turnaround time (TAT), average cost, and required skill for four colistin resistance diagnostics viz., CHROMagar COL-APSE, ComASP Colistin, MicroScan, and Colistin MAC Test (CMT) were evaluated against broth microdilution (BMD) using 84 Gram-negative bacterial isolates. A multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used to screen all isolates to detect the presence of the mcr-1 to mcr-5 genes. A 15-point grading scale was used to grade the tests under skill, ease, processing time etc. mcr-1 was detected by both M-PCR and CMT in a single E. coli isolate, with other PCR amplicons suggestive of mcr-2, -3 and -4 genes being also observed on the gel. The sensitivity and specificity of CHROMagar COL-APSE, MicroScan, and ComASP Colistin, were  82.05% and 66.67%,  92.31% and 76.92%, and 100% and 88.89% respectively. The MicroScan was the most expensive at a cost (per sampe tested) of R221.6 ($15.0), followed by CHROMagar COL-APSE (R118.3; $8.0), M-PCR (R75.1; $5.1), CMT (R20.1; $1.4) and ComASP Colistin (R2.64; $0.2). CHROMagar was the easiest to perform, followed by ComASP Colistin, M-PCR, MicroScan, CMT and BMD whilst M-PCR and MicroScan required higher skill. The ComASP Colistin was the best performing diagnostic test, with low VME and ME, making it recommendable for routine colistin sensitivity testing in clinical laboratories; particularly, in poorer settings. It is however limited by a TAT of 18-24 hours.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.17.19015156v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.17.19015156v2.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Pathology

"Multimodal neuroimaging and suicidality in a US population-based sample of school-aged children","Importance: Suicide deaths and suicidality are considered a public health emergency, yet their brain underpinnings remain elusive. 

Objective: To examine individual, environmental, and clinical characteristics, as well as multimodal brain imaging correlates of suicidality in a US population-based sample of school-aged children.

Design: Cross-sectional analysis of the first wave of data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study

Setting: Multicenter population-based study

Participants: Children aged 9-10 years from unreferred, community samples with suicidality data available (n=7,994). Following quality control, we examined structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) (n=6,238), resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) (n=4,134), and task-based fMRI (range n=4,075 to 4,608).

Exposure: Lifetime suicidality, defined as suicidal ideation, plans and attempts reported by children or/and caregivers.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Multimodal neuroimaging analyses examined differences with Welch t-test and Equivalence Tests, with observed effect sizes (ES, Cohen d) and their 90% confidence interval (CI) < |0.15|. Predictive values were examined using the area under precision-recall curves (AUPRC). Measures included, cortical volume and thickness, large-scale network connectivity and task-based MRI of reward processing, inhibitory control and working memory.

Results: Among the 7,994 unrelated children (3,757 females [47.0%]), those will lifetime suicidality based on children (n=684 [8.6%]; 276 females [40.4%]), caregiver (n=654 [8.2%]; 233 females [35.6%]) or concordant reports (n=198 [2.5%]; 67 females [33.8%]), presented higher levels of social adversity and psychopathology on themselves and their caregivers compared to never-suicidal children (n=6,854 [85.7%]; 3,315 females [48.3%]). A wide range of brain areas was associated with suicidality, but only one test (0.06%) survived statistical correction: children with caregiver-reported suicidality had a thinner left bank of the superior temporal sulcus compared to never-suicidal children (ES=-0.17, 95%CI -0.26, -0.08, pFDR=0.019). Based on the prespecified bounds of |0.15|, ~48% of the group mean differences for child-reported suicidality comparisons and a ~22% for parent-reported suicidality comparisons were considered equivalent. All observed ES were relatively small (d=|0.20|) and with low predictive value (AUPRC=0.10).

Conclusion and Relevance: Using commonly-applied neuroimaging measures, we were unable to find a discrete brain signature related to suicidality in youth.

"Assessing spread risk of Wuhan novel coronavirus within and beyond China, January-April 2020: a travel network-based modelling study","Objective: To estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January through to April, 2020.
Design: Travel network-based modelling study.
Setting and participants: General population travelling from Wuhan and other high-risk cities in China.
Main outcome measures: Based on de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports, we defined the relative importation risk and internal and international destinations of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan and other high-risk cities in China.
Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China, and a high proportion of cases likely travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak. Should secondary outbreaks occur in 17 high-risk secondary cities, they could contribute to seeding the virus in other highly connected cities within and beyond China after the LNY holiday. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of Wuhan. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases seen. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent.
Conclusion: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020479v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020479v1.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Epidemiology

"Network-based Drug Repurposing for Human Coronavirus","Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020263v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020263v1.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Forecasting the Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemics using a simple (simplistic) model","Confirmed infection cases in mainland China were analyzed using the data up to January 28, 2020 (first 13 days of reliable confirmed cases). In addition, all available data up to February 3 were processed the same way. For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data reported until the time of writing . Using this model and the first set of data, we estimate that the maximum cases will be about 21,000 reaching this level in mid-February. Using all available data the maximum number of cases is somewhat higher at 29,000 but its dynamics does not change. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020461v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020461v1.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Epidemiology

"A survey to explore new markers of achievement to assess and monitor gender equity in an NIHR Biomedical Research Centre: A two-factor model","Background: The underrepresentation of women in academic medicine at senior level and in leadership positions is well documented. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) announced that eligibility for funding for Biomedical Research Centres (BRCs) required at least Silver award status of the Athena SWAN Charter. However, the evidence base for monitoring gender equity (GE) in BRCs is underdeveloped. 
Methods: An exploratory online survey distributed to an entire population of NIHR Oxford BRC affiliates (N=683) who ranked the importance of 13 markers of GE on a five point Likert scale. Data were summarised using frequencies and descriptive statistics. Interrelationships between the markers and underlying latent dimensions (factors) were determined by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Thematic analysis was used to analyse open-ended comments.
Results: The response rate was 36% (243 respondents). Respondents were more frequently female (55%, n=133), aged 41-50 years (33%, n=81), investigators (33%, n=81) and had been affiliated with the BRC for 2-7 years (39.5%, n=96). Participants ranked BRC senior leadership roles and organisational policies on gender equity, as very important, 58% (n=141) and 57% (n=139) respectively. The top two markers ranked as very important by female participants were organisational policies (64.7%, n=86/133) and recruitment and retention (60.9%, n=81/133), whereas male participants ranked leadership development (52.1%, n=50/96) and BRC senior leadership roles (50%, n=48/96) as being very important. The factor analyses showed two distinct latent dimensions: organisational markers and individual markers of GE in BRCs. Open ended comments suggested three key areas of actions: monitoring and benchmarking, organisational support for those with childcare responsibilities, and leadership and Institutional support for GE.
Conclusions: 
The findings suggest a two-factor model of markers of achievement for GE with organisational and individual dimensions. Implementation and sustainability of gender equity requires commitment at senior leadership and organisational policy level.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020347v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020347v1.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Health Policy

"Population movement, city closure and spatial transmission of the 2019-nCoV infection in China","The outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City of China obtained global concern, the population outflow from Wuhan has contributed to spatial expansion in other parts of China. We examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the 2019-nCoV transmission in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan. We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of cases. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could be prevented, and if two days later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Our findings suggest that population movement might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the epidemic.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020339v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020339v1.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Epidemiology

"The impact of traffic isolation in Wuhan on the spread of 2019-nCov","The 2019-nCoV outbreak occurred near the Chinese Spring Festival transport period in Wuhan. As an important transportation center, the migration of Wuhan accelerated the spread of 2019-nCoV across mainland China. Based on the cumulative Baidu migration index (CBMI), we first analyzed the proportion of Wuhan's migrant population to other cities. Our results confirm that there is a significant correlation between the export population of Wuhan and reported cases in various regions. We subsequently found that the mortality rate in Hubei Province was much higher than that in other regions of mainland China, while the investigation of potential cases in Wuhan was far behind other provinces in Mainland China, which indicates the effectiveness of early isolation.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020438v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020438v1.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Getting to zero quickly in the 2019-nCov epidemic with vaccines or rapid testing","Any plan for stopping the ongoing 2019-nCov epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Using an SEIR-type transmission model, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by one-time vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients within 24 hours of symptom onset (assuming 10% asymptomatic transmission). The epidemic could be ended in six months if testing with isolation and treatment reached 90% of symptomatic patients. If 90% of symptomatic patients could be tested within six hours of symptoms appearing, the epidemic could be ended in under four months.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020271v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020271v1.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Epidemiology

"Integrative Bioinformatics Analysis Provides Insight into the Molecular Mechanisms of 2019-nCoV","The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV according to the updated findings. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility, which was consistent with current clinical observations. Moreover, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. We also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings could explain the clinical symptoms so far and help clinicians and researchers understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020206v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020206v1.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Circulating tumor DNA in neoadjuvant treated breast cancer reflects response and survival","Pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is strongly associated with favorable outcome. We examined the utility of serial circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing for predicting pCR and risk of metastatic recurrence in 84 high-risk early breast cancer patients treated in the neoadjuvant I-SPY 2 TRIAL. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was isolated from 291 plasma samples collected at pretreatment (T0), 3 weeks after initiation of paclitaxel (T1), between paclitaxel and anthracycline regimens (T2), or prior to surgery (T3). A personalized ctDNA test was designed to detect 16 patient-specific mutations (from whole exome sequencing of pretreatment tumor) in cfDNA by ultra-deep sequencing. At T0, 61 of 84 (73%) patients were ctDNA-positive, which decreased over time (T1-35%; T2-14%; T3-9%). Patients who remained ctDNA-positive at T1 were significantly more likely to have residual disease after NAC (83% non-pCR) compared to those who cleared ctDNA (52% non-pCR; OR 4.33, P=0.012). After NAC, all patients who achieved pCR were ctDNA-negative (n=17, 100%). For those who did not achieve pCR (n=43), ctDNA-positive patients (14%) had significantly increased risk of metastatic recurrence (HR 10.4; 95% CI, 2.346.6); interestingly, patients who did not achieve pCR but were ctDNA-negative (86%) had excellent outcome, similar to those who achieved pCR (HR 1.4; 95% CI, 0.1513.5). Lack of ctDNA clearance was a significant predictor of poor response and metastatic recurrence, while clearance was associated with improved survival regardless of pCR status. Personalized monitoring of ctDNA during NAC may aid in real-time assessment of treatment response and help fine-tune pCR as a surrogate endpoint of survival.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019760v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019760v1.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Oncology

"Differential vulnerability of the cerebellum in healthy ageing and Alzheimer's disease","Introduction: Ageing and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) result in cerebellar atrophy, but it is unclear whether atrophy engages similar or distinct structural and functional cerebellar territories. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of cerebellar grey matter loss in ageing and AD. We mapped voxels with structural decline along cerebellar functional gradients that provide a quantitative measure of functional specialisation - Gradient 1 progresses from motor to default-mode territories; Gradient 2 isolates task-positive processing areas; Gradient 3 captures lateralisation differences in cognitive regions. Results: We identified bilateral cerebellar atrophy in default-mode, cognitive control and attention networks in ageing, and right-lateralised AD-related atrophy in similar macroscale networks. Age- and AD-related structural decline showed partial spatial overlap. Functional localisation differences between ageing and AD atrophy were observed only on Gradient 3.

"Risk assessment of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreaks outside China","We developed a computational tool to assess the risk of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: 
(i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas;
(ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions,  and the efficacy of entry screening at destination;
(iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia and Europe, and we investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020503v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020503v1.full.pdf","2020-02-05","Epidemiology

"Improving Esophageal Protection during AF ablation: the IMPACT study.","Background: Thermal injury to the esophagus is a known complication of ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) and accounts for most procedure-related mortality. Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen by infusing cold liquid can reduce thermal injury to a limited extent. 

Objective: To investigate the ability of a powerful temperature control device to protect the esophagus from ablation-related thermal injury.

Methods: A single-center, prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial was used to investigate the ability of the ensoETM device to protect the esophagus from thermal injury. This method was compared in a 1:1 randomization to a control group of standard practice utilizing a single-point temperature probe. In the study group, the device was used to keep the luminal temperature at 4 degrees during radiofrequency (RF) ablation for AF. Endoscopic examination was performed at 7 days post-ablation and esophageal injury was scored. The patient and the endoscopist were blinded to the randomization.

Results: We recruited 188 patients, of whom 120 underwent endoscopy. Thermal injury to the mucosa was significantly more common in the control group than in those receiving esophageal protection (12/60 versus 2/60; P=0.008), with a trend toward reduction in gastroparesis (6/60 Vs 2/60, p=0.27). There was no difference between groups in RF duration, force, power and combined ablation index (P value range= 0.2-0.9). Procedure duration and fluoroscopy duration were similar (P=0.97, P=0.91 respectively). 

Conclusion: Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen significantly reduces ablation-related thermal injury compared to standard care. This method of esophageal protection is safe and does not compromise the efficacy of the ablation procedure.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019158v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019158v2.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Step-downs reduce workers compensation payments to encourage return to work. Are they effective?","Objective:
To determine whether step-downs, which cut the rate of compensation paid to injured workers after they have been on benefits for several months, are effective as a return to work incentive.
Methods:
We aggregated administrative claims data from eight Australian workers compensation systems to calculate weekly scheme exit rates, a proxy for return to work. Jurisdictions were further subdivided into four injury subgroups: fractures, musculoskeletal, mental health, and other trauma. The effect of step-downs on scheme exit was tested using a regression discontinuity design. Results were pooled into meta-analyses to calculate combined effects and the proportion of variance attributable to heterogeneity.
Results:
The combined effect of step-downs was a 0.86 percentage point (95% CI -1.45 to -0.27) reduction in the exit rate, with significant heterogeneity between jurisdictions (I2 = 68%, p = .003). Neither timing nor magnitude of step-downs was a significant moderator of effects. Within injury subgroups, only fractures had a significant combined effect (-0.84, 95% CI -1.61 to -0.07). Sensitivity analysis indicated potential effects within mental health and musculoskeletal conditions as well.
Conclusions:
The results suggest some workers compensation recipients anticipate step-downs exit early to avoid the reduction in income. However, the effects were small and suggest step-downs have marginal practical significance. We conclude that step-downs are generally ineffective as a return to work policy initiative.","/content/10.1101/19012286v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012286v3.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Relationships among Commercial Biases and Author Conflicts of Interest in Biomedical Publishing","Recently, concerns have been raised over the potential impacts of commercial biases on editorial practices in biomedical publishing. Specifically, it has been suggested that commercial biases may make editors more open to publishing articles with author conflicts of interest (aCOI). Using a data set of 128,781 articles published in 159 journals, we evaluated the relationships among commercial publishing biases and reported author conflicts of interest. The 159 journals were grouped according to commercial biases (reprint services, advertising revenue, and ownership by a large commercial publishing firm). 30.6% (39,440) of articles were published in journals showing no evidence of commercial publishing biases. 33.9% (43,630) were published in journals accepting advertising and reprint fees; 31.7% (40,887) in journals owned by large publishing firms; 1.2% (1,589) in journals accepting reprint fees only; and 2.5 % (3,235) in journals accepting only advertising fees. Journals with commercial biases were more likely to publish articles with aCOI (9.2% (92/1000) vs. 6.4% (64/1000), p = 0.024). In the multivariate analysis, only a journal's acceptance of reprint fees served as a significant predictor (OR = 2.81 at 95% CI, 1.5 to 8.6). Shared control estimation was used to evaluate the relationships between commercial publishing biases and aCOI frequency in total and by type. BCa-corrected mean difference effect sizes ranged from -1.0 to 6.1, and confirm findings indicating that accepting reprint fees may constitute the most significant commercial bias. The findings indicate that concerns over the influence of industry advertising in medical journals may be overstated, and that accepting fees for reprints may constitute the largest risk of bias for editorial decision-making.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018705v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.20018705v2.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Medical Ethics

"The incubation period of 2019-nCoV from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application","A novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified in China in December, 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period, which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Here, we use data from public reports of 101 confirmed cases in 38 provinces, regions, and countries outside of Wuhan (Hubei province, China) with identifiable exposure windows and known dates of symptom onset to estimate the incubation period of 2019-nCoV. We estimate the median incubation period of 2019-nCoV to be 5.2 days (95% CI 4.4-6.0), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 10.5 days (95% CI: 7.3, 15.3) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 64 out of every 10,000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of active  monitoring or quarantine. Whether this risk is acceptable depends on the underlying risk of infection and consequences of missed cases. The estimates presented here can be used to inform policy in multiple contexts based on these judgments.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.02.20020016v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.02.20020016v1.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer is associated with RAS/AKT pathway dysregulation and high tumour mutational burden.","Purpose: Pathological complete response (pathCR) in rectal cancer, seen in examination of the pathological specimen post-surgery is the phenomenon whereby a tumour completely regresses under treatment with chemoradiotherapy. This is beneficial as up to 75% of patients do not experience regrowth of the primary tumour, allowing organ preservation and is poorly understood. We aimed to characterise the processes involved in pathCR.
Materials & Methods: Two groups of patients were identified with either complete response (pathCR group) or no response (poor response group) and biopsy and/or resection specimen blocks were retrieved. These underwent high read depth amplicon sequencing, exome sequencing, methylation arrays and immunohistochemistry for DNA repair pathway proteins. Sequencing data underwent analysis and the two cohorts were compared.
Results: Seven patients who underwent pathological complete response and twenty four who underwent poor response (to act as opposite 'extreme phenotypes') underwent molecular characterisation. Patients in the complete response group had significantly higher tumour mutational burden, neoantigen load and enrichments for mutations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway as well as significantly lower numbers of structural variants. There were no differences in copy number variants or tumour heterogeneity. Methylation analysis demonstrated enrichment for changes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.
Conclusions: The phenomenon of pathCR in rectal cancer appears to be related to immunovisibility caused by a high tumour mutational burden phenotype. Resistance mechanisms seem to involve the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway and tumour heterogeneity does not seem to play a role in resistance.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20019794v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20019794v1.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Oncology

"Health related effects of education levels: a Mendelian randomization study","A deeper understanding of the causal links from education level to health outcomes may shed a light for disease prevention. We conducted a wide-angled Mendelian randomization to disentangle the causal role of education level from intelligence for 31 health outcomes and explore to what extent body mass index and smoking mediate the associations. Genetically higher education level was associated with lower risk of major psychiatric disorders and most somatic diseases independent of intelligence, including suicide attempts, large artery stroke, heart failure, lung cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes, insomnia, major depressive disorder, total and ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and gout. Adjustment for body mass index and smoking attenuated the associations between education and several outcomes, especially for type 2 diabetes and heart failure. These findings emphasize the importance of education to reduce the burden of common diseases.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20020008v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20020008v1.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Public and Global Health

"Estimating the risk on outbreak spreading of 2019-nCoV in China using transportation data","A novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, China and has been causing an unprecedented outbreak in China. The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency.  During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence.
 
Here, we have developed a mathematical framework incorporating city-to-city connections to calculate the number of imported cases of the novel virus from an outbreak source, and the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases. We used this number to estimate the arrival time of outbreak emergence using air travel frequency data from Wuhan to other cities, collected from the International Air Transport Association database. In addition, a meta-population compartmental model was built based on a classical SIR approach to simulate outbreaks at different cities. 

We consider the scenarios under three basic reproductive number  settings using the best knowledge of the current findings, from high (2.92), mild (1.68), to a much lower numbers (1.4). The mean arrival time of outbreak spreading has been determined. Under the high , the critical time is 17.9 days after December 31, 2019 for outbreak spreading. Under the low , the critical time is between day 26.2 to day 35 after December 31, 2019. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low  (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the connections between the source and target cities. Under the higher  (2.92), the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence is generally low until the border control measure was enhanced to reduce more than 95% of the connections.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20019984v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20019984v1.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Epidemiology

"Microstructural degeneration underlies executive dysfunction after stroke","Objective: Executive dysfunction affects 40% of stroke patients and is associated with poor quality of life. Stroke severity and lesion volume rarely predict whether a patient will have executive dysfunction. Stroke typically occurs on a background of cerebrovascular burden, which impacts cognition and brain network structural integrity. We investigated whether measures of white matter microstructural integrity and cerebrovascular risk factors better explain executive dysfunction than markers of stroke severity. 
Methods: We used structural equation modelling to examine multivariate relationships between cerebrovascular risk, white matter microstructural integrity (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity), stroke characteristics and executive dysfunction in 126 stroke patients (mean age 68.4 years), three months post-stroke, and compared to 40 age- and sex-matched control participants. Executive function was measured using the Trail Making Tests, Clock Drawing task and Rey Complex Figure copy task. Microstructural integrity was estimated using a standard pipeline to process diffusion weighted images. 
Results: Executive function was below what would be expected for age and education level in stroke patients (t-test compared to controls t(79)=5.75, p<0.001). A multivariate structural equation model illustrated the complex relationship between executive function, white matter integrity, stroke characteristics and cerebrovascular risk. Pearsons correlations confirmed a stronger relationship between executive dysfunction and white matter integrity, than executive dysfunction and stroke severity. Mediation analysis showed the relationship between executive function and white matter integrity is mediated by cerebrovascular burden. 
Interpretation: White matter microstructural degeneration of the superior longitudinal fasciculus in the executive control network better explains executive dysfunction than markers of stroke severity.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020131v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020131v1.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Neurology

"Use of an integrated pan-cancer oncology enrichment NGS assay to measure tumour mutational burden and detect clinically actionable variants","Introduction: The identification of tumour mutational burden (TMB) as a biomarker of response to PD-1 immunotherapy has necessitated the development of genomic assays to measure this. We carried out comprehensive molecular profiling of cancers using the Illumina TruSight Oncology panel  (TSO500) and compared to whole genome sequencing.  
Methods: Cancer samples derived from formalin fixed material were profiled on the TSO500 panel, sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument and processed through the TSO500 Docker Pipeline. Either FASTQ files (PierianDx) or VCF files (OncoKDM) were processed to understand clinical actionability.
Results: In total, 108 samples (a mixture of colorectal, lung, oesophageal and control samples) were processed via the DNA panel. There was good correlation between TMB, SNV, indels and CNV as predicted by TSO500 and WGS (R2>0.9) and good reproducibility, with less than 5% variability between repeated controls. For the RNA panel, 13 samples were processed, with all known fusions observed via orthogonal techniques detected. For clinical actionability 72 Tier 1 variants and 297 Tier 2 variants were identified with clinical trials identified for all patients. 
Conclusions: The TruSight Oncology 500 assay accurately measures TMB, MSI, single nucleotide variants, indels, copy number/structural variation and gene fusions when compared to whole genome sequencing and orthogonal technologies. Coupled with a clinical annotation pipeline this provides a powerful methodology for identification of clinically actionable variants.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20019992v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20019992v1.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Early epidemiological analysis of the 2019-nCoV outbreak based on a crowdsourced data","Abstract: As the outbreak of novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) progresses within China and beyond, there is a need for rapidly available epidemiological data to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we present an effort to compile epidemiological information on 2019-nCoV from media news reports and a physician community website (dxy.cn) between Jan 20, 2020 and Jan 30, 2020, as the outbreak entered its 7th week. We compiled a line list of patients reported in China and internationally and daily case counts by Chinese province. We describe the demographics, hospitalization and reporting delays for 288 patients, over time and geographically. We find a decrease in case detection lags in provinces outside of Wuhan and internationally, compared to Wuhan, and after Jan 18, 2020, as outbreak awareness increased. The rapid progression of reported cases in different provinces of China is consistent with local transmission beyond Wuhan. The age profile of cases points at a deficit among children under 15 years of age, possibly related to prior immunity with related coronavirus or behavioral differences. Overall, our datasets, which have been publicly available since Jan 21, 2020, align with official reports from Chinese authorities published more than a week later. Availability of publicly available datasets in the early stages of an outbreak is important to encourage disease modeling efforts by independent academic modeling teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019935v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019935v1.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Epidemiology

"Dynamics of within-host Mycobacterium tuberculosis diversity and heteroresistance during treatment","Background: Studying within-host genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in patients during treatment may identify adaptations to antibiotic and immune pressure. Understanding the significance of genetic heteroresistance, and more specifically heterozygous resistance-associated variants (RAVs), is clinically important given increasing use of rapid molecular tests and whole genome sequencing (WGS).
Methods: We analyse data from six cohort studies in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Most patients (>75%) had baseline rifampicin-resistance. Sputum was collected for culture at baseline and at between two and nine intervals until month six. Positive cultures underwent WGS. Mixed infections and reinfections were excluded from analysis.
Findings: Baseline Mtb genetic diversity was independently associated with cavitary disease, HIV coinfection and not taking antiretroviral therapy, infection with lineage 2 strains and absence of second-line drug resistance. Baseline genetic diversity was not associated with six-month outcome. Genetic diversity increased following treatment at week one and two before returning to baseline levels. Baseline genetic heteroresistance was most common for bedaquiline (6/10 [60%] of isolates with RAVs) and fluoroquinolones (9/62 [13%]). Most patients with heterozygous RAVs on WGS with sequential isolates available demonstrated persistence or fixation RAV(s) (17/20, 85%). New RAVs emerged in 9/286 (3%) patients during treatment. We could detect low-frequency RAVs preceding only preceded emergent resistance in only one case.
Interpretation: In single-strain Mtb infections, pre-treatment within-host bacterial genetic diversity did not predict outcome but may reveal adaptations to host and drug pressures. Predicting emergent resistance from low-frequency RAVs requires further work to separate transient from consequential mutations.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019786v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019786v1.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Combinatorial benefit without synergy in recent clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors","Hundreds of clinical trials are testing whether combination therapies can increase the anti-tumor activity of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs). We find that the benefits of recently reported and approved combinations involving ICIs are fully accounted for by increasing the chance of a single-agent response (drug independence), with no requirement for additive or synergistic efficacy. Thus, the degree of success of combinations involving ICIs with other therapies is largely predictable.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019604v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019604v1.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Oncology

"Cognitive profile partly mediates allergy-associated decrease in mental health","There is a well-established link between allergies and mental health. While both atopic and food allergies are associated with increased levels of depression and anxiety, it is unclear what the mechanism behind this relationship is. Several theories touch upon potential psychological mechanisms, but until now only general reductions in cognitive performance as a function of allergy have been reported. We employed a tablet-based high-resolution assessment of cognition that also recorded mental health, socio-economic status, and allergies in 533 children aged 7-9 years. We then employed mediation analyses to investigate the role of cognitive variables in the relation between allergy and mental health, Welch's t-tests to test for differences between children with and without allergies, and logistic regression to identify what variables predicted allergic state. In line with previous research, we found children with allergies reported higher levels of anxiety and depression. Furthermore, they showed a unique profile of higher processing speed, equal verbal short-term memory, and worse performance on tests of fluid reasoning, number sense, search organisation, and spatial short-term memory. We confirmed that these variables predicted allergic state using logistic regression. Finally, mediation analyses showed that cognition partially mediated the relationship between allergy and both anxiety and depression. Our results suggest that allergies bias children towards particular cognitive profiles, which in turn are risk factors for anxiety and depression. This supports the view that early intervention could reduce the number of allergic children that develops comorbid psychiatric conditions.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20019778v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20019778v1.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Pediatrics

"Predicting Self-harm Incidents Following Inpatient Visits using Disease Comorbidity Network","Self-harm is serious but preventable, particularly if the risk can be identified early. But the early detection of self-harm individuals is so far not satisfied. This study aims to develop and test a comorbidity network-enhanced deep learning framework to improve the prediction of individual self-harm within 12 months after hospital discharge. Between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2010, we obtained 2,323 patients with self-harm clinical record from 1,764,094 inpatients across 44 public hospitals in Hong Kong and 46,460 randomly sampled population controls from those same hospitals. Eighty percent (80%) of the study sample was randomly selected for model training, and the remaining 20% was set aside for model testing. The proposed comorbidity network-enhanced model was compared with a baseline deep learning model for self-harm prediction. The C-statistic, precision and sensitivity were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed model and the baseline model. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed comorbidity network-enhanced model outperformed baseline model in identifying patients who would self-harm within 12 months (C-statistic of proposed model 0.89). The precision was 0.54 for positive cases and 0.98 for negative cases, whilst the sensitivity was 0.72 for positive cases and 0.96 for negative cases. Results indicated that it is critical to consider the general disease comorbidity patterns in self-harm screening and prevention programs. The model also extracted the most predictive diagnoses, and pairs of comorbid diagnoses which provide medical professionals with an effective screening strategy.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019331v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019331v1.full.pdf","2020-02-04","Health Informatics

"Using Media to Promote Public Awareness of Early Detection of Kaposi's Sarcoma in Africa","Background: Despite its hallmark cutaneous presentation, most Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in Africa is diagnosed too late for effective treatment.  Early diagnosis will only be achievable if patients with KS present earlier for care.  We hypothesized that public awareness about KS can be enhanced through exposure to common media.
Methods: We developed educational messages regarding early detection of KS for the general African public portraying a three-part theme: Look (regularly examine one's skin/mouth); Show (bring to the attention of a healthcare provider any skin/mouth changes); and Test (ask for a biopsy for definitive diagnosis).  We packaged the messages in three common media forms (comic strips, radio, and video) and tested their effect on increasing KS awareness among adults attending markets in Uganda.  Participants were randomized to a single exposure to one of the media and evaluated for change in KS-related knowledge and attitudes.
Results: Among 420 participants, media exposure resulted in increased ability to identify KS (from 0.95% pre-test to 46% post-test); awareness that anyone is at risk for KS (29% to 50%); belief that they may be at risk (63% to 76%); and knowledge that definitive diagnosis requires biopsy (23% to 51%) (all p<0.001).  Most participants (96%) found the media culturally appropriate.
Conclusion:  Exposure to media featuring a theme of Look, Show, Test resulted in changes in knowledge and attitudes concerning KS among the general public in Uganda.  High incidence and poor survival of KS in Africa are an impetus to further evaluate these media, which are freely available online.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19013649v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.19013649v2.full.pdf","2020-02-06",NA,"Laker-Oketta","/highwire/citation/71836/bibtext",1,"070220-1","07/02/2020","71836"
"TG-Interacting Factor 1 expression quantitatively impacts survival in acute myeloid leukemia","Applying transcriptional profiling analysis to myeloblasts from 59 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated at our institution, we found that expression of the three-amino acid loop extension (TALE) homeobox gene TG-Interacting Factor 1 (TGIF1) correlated with overall and relapse-free survival, which was then confirmed in two other cohorts of patients. Moreover, TGIF1 expression correlated with survival for all cytogenetic risk groups and was an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. To elucidate the mechanism, we used Tgif1 knockout mice in which acute or chronic myeloid leukemia was induced through retroviral transfer of the MLL-AF9 or BCR-ABL fusion genes into bone marrow cells. Loss of Tgif1 accelerated disease progression, shortened survival, attenuated the response to chemotherapy, and doubled the frequency of leukemia-initiating cells. RNA-based sequencing analysis showed that genes associated with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)and retinoic acid signaling pathways were differentially affected in Tgif1-/- compared to Tgif1+/+ leukemia cells.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020537v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020537v1.full.pdf","2020-02-06","Oncology

"Making the urban environment around schools healthier, developing an initial programme theory: an early realist process evaluation of the London superzones pilot","BACKGROUND:
More than four out of five people in England live in an urban area so the urban environment is an important determinant of health and an important contributor to health inequalities. This is especially true for children, for whom the impacts of their local environment may have lifelong effects. To improve the health effects of the urban environment the London Devolution Partnership piloted multi-agency partnerships focusing on 400m 'superzones' around schools in deprived communities. The intention is for local partners to work together to make the environment within the superzone healthier.

METHODS: 
A realist process evaluation of 13 pilot sites. We used data from programme documents, a rapid literature search, and interviews with lead officers for the 13 local authorities that took part in the programme. Qualitative analysis was used to identify combinations of context, mechanisms, and outcomes (CMOs) that affected the creation of a local partnership and plan. 

RESULTS: 
All but one of the 13 pilot sites established a superzone and multi-agency action plan. We identified 12 CMOs that affect the process of creating a school superzone. We present a logic model that describes how these CMOs combine to make up an initial programme theory of superzones.  Key aspects of this programme theory include the importance of local partners' priorities, leadership and support from across the local authority, and the flexibility of the model itself.

CONCLUSION:  
The superzones model is an emerging framework for local place-based partnership working to improve the urban environment. However, the success of the model is likely to depend on local context. The evidence presented here could guide the further roll out of the model, and support those local authorities that want to create superzones.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020396v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020396v1.full.pdf","2020-02-06","Public and Global Health

"Epidemiology of pediatric cancer in the Northwest Region of Cameroon","Background: The epidemiological scale of cancer in Cameroon is still relatively unknown, as public health research in sub-Saharan Africa has traditionally focused on infectious and/or communicable disease. As awareness for chronic disease such as cancer has risen, so, too, have diagnoses and incidence. In order to ensure more effective care and quality of life for children at greater risk for cancer diagnoses, specific and effective research must be conducted in order to institute effective policy and protocols.

Objective: To comprehensively review all pediatric cancer cases seen in the Northwest Region of Cameroon in order to provide novel, current epidemiological data on pediatric cancer in the region.

Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed each individual pediatric cancer case seen from January 1, 2016, through November 30, 2017, in the three largest hospitals in the Northwest Region of Cameroon: Mbingo Baptist Hospital, Bamenda Provincial Hospital, and Banso Baptist Hospital.

Results: 173 cases of pediatric cancer were identified as being treated in one of the three hospitals in question over the 25-month study period. The average age of the patients was 6.23 years (SD =  3.93), and 58.4% of the patients were male. The three most common types of cancer diagnosed in these pediatric patients were Burkitt lymphoma, retinoblastoma, and Wilms tumor. Of the 173 cases, 105 of the patients were originally from the Northwest Region. The incidence of pediatric cancer originating from the Northwest Region of Cameroon is 5.92 cases (95% CI: 4.79 - 7.05) per 100,000 persons per year.

Conclusion: This study is the first extensive examination of pediatric cancer epidemiology in the Northwest Region of Cameroon. Children in sub-Saharan Africa are disproportionately affected by cancer in comparison with their counterparts in the developed world. As the body of literature continues to grow in the years to come, more effective care both preventive and curative can affect the lives of millions.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020487v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020487v1.full.pdf","2020-02-06","Epidemiology

"Quantification of positive family history as a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease","Objective: There is very little research regarding quantification of family history as a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease. This is especially so in the South Asian population, which tends to suffer from ischaemic heart disease at a much younger age, even after environmental and dietary factors are accounted for. This indicates a likely genetic basis. The aim of this study was to quantify family history as a risk factor.
Methods: It is a retrospective, cross-sectional study. Patients with family history and hypertension as the only cardiac risk factors were recruited in the study along with control subjects. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was used for the detection of myocardial ischemia.
Results: 114 patients had hypertension and family history as the only risk factors. 64 of these patients had myocardial ischemia. 102 control patients were also recruited, of whom only 26 suffered from myocardial ischemia. The odds-ratio was thus calculated to be 3.69 (95% CI: 1.54-9.28, p=0.001).
Conclusions: These findings suggest a strong genetic basis for ischemic heart disease in the South Asian population. This needs to be taken into consideration when such patients present with non-specific cardiac symptoms.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020560v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020560v1.full.pdf","2020-02-06","Cardiovascular Medicine

"A protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial of guided self-help Behavioral Activation intervention for geriatric depression","Background: Aging is a social concern. Despite increased incidence of depression in Chinese older populations, they are often misdiagnosed and undertreated, which pose a challenge to our health care system. Depressed older adults often suffer from lack of motivation. Evidence-based guided self-help behavioral activation treatment is effective in reducing anhedonia and amotivation symptoms, however the efficacy in in elderly depressed patients are unknown yet. So the current study aim to pilot the self-help guided intervention for the treatment of depression in elderly patients.
Methods/design: A pilot randomized controlled trial with 30 elderly inpatients with major depressive disorder will be conducted. Participants attending clinical psychological clinics at Mental Health Center of Chongqing will be randomized to receive guided self-help BA intervention or to a 6-week waiting list control. Participants in the treatment group will receive 6 sessions of guided self-help BA intervention delivered over the telephone. The waiting list control group will receive the intervention after a waiting period of 6 weeks. Exclusion criteria are limited to those at significant risk of harm to self or others, the presence of primary mental health disorder other than depression or intellectual disability at a level meaning potential participants would be unable to access the intervention. The study has ethical approval from the Chinese Research Ethics Committee. Our hypothesis is that guided self-help BA will effective when compared with the waiting-list intervention. 
Results: Effects of the treatment were observed on three outcomes domains: (1) clinical outcomes (symptom severity, recovery rates); (2) process variables (patient satisfaction, attendance, dropout); and (3) economic outcomes (cost and resource use). We also examine mediators of outcomes in terms of patient variables (behavioral activation/inhibition motivation). Results will be disseminated to patients, the wider public, clinicians and researchers through publication in journals and presentation at conferences.
Discussion: This is the first study to investigate guided self-help interventions for China geriatric depressed patients, a group which is currently under-represented in mental health research. The intervention is modular and adapted from an empirically supported behavioral activation treatment for depression (BATD). The generalizability and broad inclusion criteria are strengths but may also lead to some weaknesses.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020156v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020156v1.full.pdf","2020-02-06","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange for the treatment of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Protocol for a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare blood disorder that results in hemolysis of red blood cells (RBCs) due to the presence of autoantibodies in the serum. Previous research has shown that the use of therapeutic plasma exchange therapy (TPE) may be effective at treating AIHA by removing autoimmune antibodies from the intravascular space. However, very little knowledge synthesis is available on the use of TPE in AIHA patients due to the rarity of the disease. We propose a meta-analysis that investigates whether the use of TPE, with or without concurrent treatment regimens, can decrease adverse events, increase remission rate and improve lab results including hemoglobin, RBC, reticulocyte counts, hematocrit and total bilirubin.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020214v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020214v1.full.pdf","2020-02-06","Epidemiology

"Grip strength is associated with retinal and choroidal thickness in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients without retinopathy","Objective: To determine the relationship between grip strength and retinal or choroidal thickness in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Design: Observational study-cross-sectional design.
Setting and Participants: The study was conducted among diabetes patients without retinopathy registered in the community health system in Guangzhou, China. 
Measures: Grip strength was measured twice for each hand with a dynamometer in kilograms (kg). The retinal and choroidal thickness in macular Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) sectors were measured by commercial swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT; DRI OCT-2 Triton; Topcon, Tokyo, Japan). 
Results: A total of 1,029 patients were included in the study. Both retinal thickness and choroidal thickness increased with the higher quartile of grip strength. Regression analyses indicated that the average retinal and choroidal thickness increased by 0.14 m (95%CI: 0.03-0.25 m, P=0.011) and 0.57 m (95%CI: 0.03-1.11 m, P=0.037) for each additional kg of grip strength following adjustment for age and gender. Further adjustments were made for axial length, HbA1c, length of time the patient had diabetes, insulin usage, height, weight and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which resulted in an average retinal and choroidal thickness increase of 0.13 m (95%CI: 0.02-0.24 m, P=0.024) and 0.65 m (95%CI: 0.13-1.16 m, P=0.013) for each additional kg of grip strength. Consistent results were obtained in the analyses in ETDRS 9 sectors.
Conclusion: Greater hand grip strength was found to be significantly associated with thicker retinal and choroidal layers in diabetic patients. Grip strength may provide a useful indicator of retinal health in diabetic patients. Further studies are needed to determine directionality and causality, and to examine whether improving muscle strength has a positive effect on retinal and choroidal thickness.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019885v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019885v2.full.pdf","2020-02-06","Ophthalmology

"Spatial inequality hides the burden of dog bites and the risk of dog-mediated human rabies","Currently, there is an active rabies outbreak in the dog population of Arequipa, Peru. Inhabitants of the city are bitten by both pets and free-roaming dogs; therefore, the risk of human rabies transmission is concerning. Our objective was to estimate the rate of dog bites in the city and to identify factors associated with going or not going to a medical facility for rabies follow-up. To this end, we conducted a door-to-door survey of 4,000 houses in 21 urban and 21 peri-urban communities. We then analyzed associations between attaining follow-up rabies care and various socioeconomic factors, stratifying by urban and peri-urban localities. We found that the rate of dog bites in peri-urban communities (12.4%) was approximately three times higher than urban areas (4.0%). Among the people who were bitten, a significantly greater number of people in urban areas got follow-up rabies care than those in peri-urban areas.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20020727v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20020727v1.full.pdf","2020-02-09","Public and Global Health

"Epigenome-wide association study using prediagnostic bloods identifies a new genomic region (near TMEM204 and IFT140) associated with pancreatic cancer risk","Background: Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) using peripheral blood have identified specific sites of DNA methylation associated with risk of various cancers and may hold promise to identify novel biomarkers of risk; however, few studies have been performed for pancreatic cancer and none using a prospective study design. 
Methods: Using a nested case-control study design, incident pancreatic cancer cases and matched controls were identified from participants who provided blood at baseline in three prospective cohort studies (Nurses' Health Study, Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians' Health Study). DNA methylation levels were measured in DNA extracted from leukocytes using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. Average follow-up period for this analysis was 13 years.
Results: A region in chromosome 16 near genes TMEM204 and IFT140 was identified as being differentially methylated in cases and controls. For some CpGs in the region, the associations were stronger with shorter time to diagnosis (e.g., OR= 5.95, 95% CI = 1.52-23.12, for top vs bottom quartile, for =5 years between blood draw and cancer diagnosis) but associations remained significantly higher even when cases were diagnosed over 10 years after blood collection. Statistically significant differences in DNA methylation levels were also observed in the gastric secretion pathway using GSEA analysis. 
Conclusions: Changes in DNA methylation in peripheral blood may mark alterations in metabolic or immune pathways (potentially including alterations in immune subtypes) that play a role in pancreatic cancer. Identifying new biological pathways in carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer using EWAS approach could provide new opportunities for improving treatment and prevention.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021121v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021121v1.full.pdf","2020-02-09","Epidemiology

"Genetic overlap and causal associations between smoking behaviours and psychiatric traits and disorders in adolescents and adults","Background: Epidemiological research shows that smoking is associated with psychiatric disorders and psychotic experiences, even after controlling for confounds such as cannabis use and sleep problems. We investigated degree of genetic overlap and tested for causal associations between smoking and psychiatric traits and disorders using genetic data. We tested whether genetic associations existed beyond genetic influences shared with confounding variables. 
Methods: Genetic correlations were estimated with LD-score regression between smoking behaviours (N=262,990-632,802) and psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression; N=41,653-173,005), psychotic experiences in adolescents (N=6,297-10,098) and adults (N=116,787-117,794) and adult schizotypy (N=3,967-4,057). Genomic Structural Equation Modelling was performed to explore the associations while accounting for genetic influences of confounders (cannabis and alcohol use, risk-taking and insomnia). Causal associations were tested using Generalized Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (GSMR). 
Results: Significant genetic correlations were found between smoking and psychiatric disorders (rg = .10 - .38) and adult PE (rg = .33 - .40).  After accounting for covarying genetic influences, genetic associations between most smoking phenotypes and schizophrenia and depression remained but not between smoking behaviours and bipolar disorder or most psychotic experiences. GSMR results supported a causal role of smoking initiation on psychiatric disorders and adolescent cognitive and negative psychotic experiences.
Conclusions: Pleiotropy between smoking behaviours and schizophrenia and depression exists beyond the common genetic basis of known confounders. Smoking also appears to be causally associated with psychiatric disorders and with cognitive PEs and negative symptoms during adolescence. Exploration of the biological links underlying smoking and psychiatric illness would be well-justified.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021089v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021089v1.full.pdf","2020-02-09","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Radiation associated brain image changes after proton therapy for skull base head and neck cancers.","Background and purpose: To characterize patterns and outcomes of brain MR image changes after proton therapy (PT) for skull base head and neck cancer (HNC).
Material and methods: 127 patients treated with PT for HNC who had received at least 40 Gy(RBE) to the brain and had at least 1 follow up MRI > 6 months after PT were analyzed. MRIs were reviewed for radiation-associated image changes (RAIC).  MRIs were rigidly registered to planning CTs, and RAIC were contoured on T1 (post contrast) and T2 weighted sequences, and dose volume parameters extracted. Probability of RAIC over time was calculated using multistate analysis. Univariate/multivariate analyses were performed using Cox Regression. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to investigate dose volume correlates of RAIC development.
Results: 17.3% developed RAIC. All RAIC events were asymptomatic and occurred in the temporal lobe (14), frontal lobe (6) and cerebellum (2). The median volume of the RAIC on post contrast T1 was 0.5 cc at their maximum size. The RAIC spontaneously resolved in 27.3%, progressed in 27.3% and improved or were stable in 29.6% of patients. The three year actuarial rate of developing RAIC was 14.3%. Brain and RAIC lesion doses were generally higher for temporal lobe RAIC compared to frontal lobe RAIC. RAIC was observed in 63% of patients when V67 Gy(RBE) of the brain exceeded 0.17 cc. 
Conclusion: RAIC lesions after PT were asymptomatic and either resolved or regressed in the majority of the patients. The estimated dose volume correlations confirm the importance of minimizing focal high doses to brain when achievable.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020610v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020610v1.full.pdf","2020-02-09","Oncology

"Incorporating Human Movement Data to Improve Epidemiological Estimates for 2019-nCoV","Estimating the key epidemiological features of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic proves to be challenging, given incompleteness and delays in early data reporting, in particular, the severe under-reporting bias in the epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As a result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geo-stratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city's lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021071v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021071v1.full.pdf","2020-02-09","Epidemiology

"Apathy is not associated with reduced ventral striatal volume in patients with schizophrenia","Background: A growing body of neuroimaging research has revealed a relationship between blunted activation of the ventral striatum (VS) and apathy in schizophrenia. In contrast, the association between reduced striatal volume and apathy is less well established, while the relationship between VS function and structure in patients with schizophrenia remains an open question. Here, we aimed to replicate previous structural findings in a larger independent sample and to investigate the relationship between VS hypoactivation and VS volume.
Methods: We included brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 60 patients with schizophrenia (SZ) that had shown an association of VS hypoactivation with apathy during reward anticipation and 58 healthy controls (HC). To improve replicability, we applied analytical methods developed in two previously published studies: Voxel-based morphometry and the Multiple Automatically Generated Templates (MAGeT) algorithm. VS and dorsal striatum (DS) volume were correlated with apathy correcting for age, gender and total brain volume. Additionally, left VS activity was correlated with left VS volume.
Results: We failed to replicate the association between apathy and reduced VS volume and did not find a correlation with DS volume. Functional and structural left VS measures exhibited a trend-level correlation (rs=0.248, p=0.067, r2=0.06).
Conclusions: Our present data suggests that functional and structural striatal neuroimaging correlates of apathy can occur independently. Replication of previous findings may have been limited by other factors (medication, illness duration, age) potentially related to striatal volume changes in SZ. Finally, associations between reward-related VS function and structure should be further explored.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20019943v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20019943v1.full.pdf","2020-02-09","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in China","Background: Since December 2019, acute respiratory disease (ARD) due to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases.
Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020.
Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P<0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67).
Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020974v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020974v1.full.pdf","2020-02-09","Respiratory Medicine

"Analysis of the epidemic growth of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak using internationally confirmed cases","Background: On January 23, 2020, a quarantine was imposed on travel in and out of Wuhan, where the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak originated from. Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China.

Methods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification.

Results: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days--4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4--9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification.

Conclusions: Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020941v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020941v1.full.pdf","2020-02-09","Epidemiology

"Clinically Applicable Deep Learning Strategy for Pulmonary Nodule Risk Prediction: Insights into HONORS","Background and Purpose: Limited optimization was clinically applicable for reducing missed diagnosis, misdiagnosis and inter-reader variability in pulmonary nodule diagnosis. We aimed to propose a deep learning-based algorithm and a practical strategy to better stratify the risk of pulmonary nodules, thus reducing medical errors and optimizing the clinical workflow.

Materials and Methods: A total of 2,348 pulmonary nodules (1,215 with lung cancer) containing screened nodules from National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) and incidentally detected nodules from Jinling Hospital (JLH) were used to train and evaluate a deep learning algorithm, Filter-guided pyramid network (FGP-NET). Internal and external test of FGP-NET were performed on two independent datasets (n=542). The performance of FGP-NET at Youden point which maximizing the Youden index was compared with 126 board-certificated radiologists. We further proposed Hierarchical Ordered Network ORiented Strategy (HONORS), which manipulates the emphasis either on sensitivity or specificity to target risk-stratified clinical scenarios, directly making decisions for some patients.

Results: FGP-NET achieved a high area under the curve (AUC) of 0.969 and 0.855 for internal and external testing, and was comparable or even outperformed the radiologists when considering sensitivity. HONORS-guided FGP-NET identified benign nodules with a high sensitivity (95.5%) in the screening scenario, and demonstrated satisfactory performance for the rest ambiguous nodules with 0.945 of AUC by the Youden point. FGP-NET also detected lung cancer with a high specificity of 94.5% in routine diagnostic scenario; an AUC of 0.809 was achieved for the rest nodules.

Conclusion: The combination of HONORS and FGP-NET provides well-organized stratification for pulmonary nodules and also offers the potential for reducing medical errors.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020297v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020297v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Radiology and Imaging

"Reconciling early-outbreak estimates of the basic reproductive number and its uncertainty: a new framework and applications to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","Background

A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has recently emerged as a global threat.
As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number Ro, the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population.
The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of Ro vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources.

Aim

We aimed to develop a framework for comparing and combining different estimates of Ro across a wide range of models.

Methods

We reviewed 7 model-based analyses of the 2019-nCoV outbreak that were published online between January 23--26, 2020.
We decompose their Ro estimates into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate r, the mean generation interval, Gbar, and the generation-interval dispersion <U+03BA>.
We use a Bayesian multilevel model to construct pooled estimates and measure uncertainties associated with these quantities.

Results

We find that most early estimates of Ro rely on strong assumptions, especially about the generation-interval dispersion.
Estimates that rely on narrow generation-interval distributions are overly sensitive to estimates of the exponential growth rate.

Conclusion

Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of Ro, including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate Ro at the outset of an epidemic.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019877v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019877v3.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Cohorting KPC+ Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) positive patients - a genomic expos of cross-colonization hazards in a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH)"," Objective:  Cohorting patients who are colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) has been demonstrated to protect uncolonized patients from acquiring MDROs in healthcare settings. A neglected aspect of cohorting is the potential for cross-transmission within the cohort and the possibility of colonized patients acquiring secondary isolates with additional antibiotic resistance traits.  We searched for evidence of cross-transmission of KPC+ Klebsiella pneumoniae  (KPC-Kp) colonization among cohorted patients in a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH), and evaluated the impact of secondary acquisitions on resistance potential.
Design: Genomic epidemiological investigation
Setting: A high-prevalence LTACH during a bundled intervention that included cohorting KPC-Kp-positive patients. 
Methods: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and location data were analyzed to identify potential cases of cross-transmission between cohorted patients. 
Results: Secondary KPC-Kp isolates from 19 of 28 admission-positive patients were more closely related to another patients isolate than to their own admission isolate. In 14 of these 19 cases there was strong genomic evidence for cross-transmission (<10 SNVs) and the majority of these patients occupied shared cohort floors (12 cases) or rooms (5 cases) at the same time. Of the 14 patients with strong genomic evidence of acquisition, 12 acquired antibiotic resistance genes not found in their primary isolates. 
Conclusions:  Acquisition of secondary KPC-Kp isolates carrying distinct antibiotic resistance genes was detected in nearly half of cohorted patients.

"Cortical abnormalities and identification for first-episode schizophrenia via high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging","Background: Evidence from neuroimaging has implicated abnormal cerebral cortical patterns in schizophrenia. Application of machine learning techniques is required for identifying structural signature reflecting neurobiological substrates of schizophrenia at the individual level. We aimed to detect and develop a method for potential marker to identify schizophrenia via the features of cerebral cortex using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Method: In this study, cortical features were measured, including volumetric (cortical thickness, surface area, and gray matter volume) and geometric (mean curvature, metric distortion, and sulcal depth) features. Patients with first-episode schizophrenia (n = 52) and healthy controls (n = 66) were included from the Department of Psychiatry at Xijing Hospital. Multivariate computation was used to examine the abnormalities of cortical features in schizophrenia. Features were selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The diagnostic capacity of multi-dimensional neuroanatomical patterns-based classification was evaluated based on diagnostic tests.
Results: Mean curvature (left insula and left inferior frontal gyrus), cortical thickness (left fusiform gyrus), and metric distortion (left cuneus and right superior temporal gyrus) revealed both group differences and diagnostic capacity. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.88, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of were 94%, 82%, and 88%, respectively. Confirming these findings, similar results were observed in the independent validation. There was a positive association between index score derived from the multi-dimensional patterns and the severity of symptoms (r = 0.40, P < .01) for patients.
Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate a view of cortical differences with capacity to discriminate between patients with schizophrenia and healthy population. Structural neuroimaging-based measurements hold great promise of paving the road for their clinical utility in schizophrenia.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020768v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020768v2.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Baseline Structural and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predicts Early Treatment Response in Schizophrenia with Radiomics Strategy","Multimodal neuroimaging features might enable accurate classification and provide personalized treatment options in psychiatric domain. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate whether structural and functional features for predicting response to overall treatment of schizophrenia at the end of the first or a single hospitalization and in addition cross validate the results. This structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study included 85 and 63 patients with schizophrenia at baseline in dataset 1 and 2, respectively. After treatment, patients were classified as responders and non-responders. Features of gray matter and functional connectivity were extracted. Radiomics analysis was used to explore the predictive performance. Prediction models were based on structural features, functional features, and combined features. We found that the prediction accuracy was 80.38% (sensitivity: 87.28%; specificity 82.47%) for the model using functional features, and 69.68% (sensitivity: 83.96%; specificity: 72.41%) for the model using structural features. Our model combined both structural and functional features accurately predicted 92.04% responder and 80.23% non-responders to overall treatment, with an accuracy of 85.03%. These results highlight the power of structural and functional MRI-derived radiomics features to predict early response to treatment in schizophrenia. Prediction models of the very early treatment response in schizophrenia could augment effective therapeutic strategies.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020784v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020784v2.full.pdf","2020-02-07",NA,"Cui","/highwire/citation/71883/bibtext",14,"100220-14","10/02/2020","71883"
"Cognitive profile partly mediates allergy-associated decrease in mental health","There is a well-established link between allergies and mental health. While both atopic and food allergies are associated with increased levels of depression and anxiety, it is unclear what the mechanism behind this relationship is. Several theories touch upon potential psychological mechanisms, but until now putative cognitive mechanisms of the link between mental health and allergies have been unexplored. We employed tablet-based deep cognitive phenotyping, and also recorded mental health, socio-economic status, and allergies in 533 children aged 7-9 years. We then employed mediation analyses to test whether cognitive mechanisms mediated the association between allergies and mental health. In line with previous research, we found children with allergies reported higher levels of anxiety and depression. Furthermore, compared to children without allergies, they showed faster processing speed, equal verbal short-term memory, and worse performance on tests of fluid reasoning, number sense, search organisation, and spatial short-term memory. We confirmed that these variables predicted allergic state using logistic regression. Most importantly, we found that cognition partially mediated the relationship between allergy and both anxiety and depression. Our results suggest that allergies bias children towards particular cognitive profiles, which in turn are risk factors for anxiety and depression. This supports the view that early cognitive interventions could reduce the number of allergic children that develops comorbid psychiatric conditions.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20019778v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20019778v3.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Pediatrics

"Enhanced mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR+) in episodic migraine: a randomized clinical trial with MRI outcomes","We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an enhanced mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR+) versus  stress management for headache (SMH). We performed a randomized, assessor-blind, clinical trial of 98 adults with episodic migraine recruited at a single academic center comparing MBSR+ (n=50) to SMH (n=48). MBSR+ and SMH were delivered weekly by group for 8 weeks, then bi-weekly for another 8 weeks. The primary clinical outcome was reduction in headache days from baseline to 20 weeks. MRI outcomes included activity of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cognitive task network during cognitive challenge, resting state connectivity of right dorsal anterior insula (daINS) to DLPFC and cognitive task network, and gray matter volume of DLPFC, daINS, and anterior midcingulate. Secondary outcomes were headache-related disability, pain severity, response to treatment, migraine days, and MRI whole-brain analyses. Reduction in headache days from baseline to 20 weeks was greater for MBSR+ (7.8 [95%CI, 6.9-8.8] to 4.6 [95%CI, 3.7-5.6]) than for SMH (7.7 [95%CI 6.7-8.7] to 6.0 [95%CI, 4.9-7.0]) (P=0.04).  52% of the MBSR+ group showed a response to treatment (50% reduction in headache days) compared with 23% in the SMH group (P=0.004). Reduction in headache-related disability was greater for MBSR+ (59.6 [95%CI, 57.9-61.3] to 54.6 [95%CI, 52.9-56.4]) than SMH (59.6 [95%CI, 57.7-61.5] to 57.5 [95%CI, 55.5-59.4]) (P=0.02). There were no differences in clinical outcomes at 52 weeks or MRI outcomes at 20 weeks, although changes related to cognitive networks with MBSR+ were observed. MBSR+ is an effective treatment option for episodic migraine.","/content/10.1101/19004069v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004069v2.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Pain Medicine

"Elucidating user behaviours in a digital health surveillance system to correct prevalence estimates","Estimating seasonal influenza prevalence is of undeniable public health importance, but remains challenging with traditional datasets due to cost and timeliness. Digital epidemiology has the potential to address this challenge, but can introduce sampling biases that are distinct to traditional systems. In online participatory health surveillance systems, the voluntary nature of the data generating process must be considered to address potential biases in estimates. Here we examine user behaviours in one such platform, FluTracking, from 2011 to 2017. We build a Bayesian model to estimate probabilities of an individual reporting in each week, given their past reporting behaviour, and to infer the weekly prevalence of influenza-like-illness (ILI) in Australia. 
	We show that a model that corrects for user behaviour can  substantially effect ILI estimates. The model examined here elucidates several factors, such as the status of having ILI and consistency of prior reporting, that are strongly associated with the likelihood of participating in online health surveillance systems. This framework could be applied to other digital participatory health systems where participation is inconsistent and sampling bias may be of concern.","/content/10.1101/19003715v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003715v2.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Epidemiology

"Oxytocin enhances the recovery of eye-contact induced autonomic arousal: A treatment mechanism study with placebo-controlled design","The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) is suggested to exert a pivotal role in a variety of complex human behaviors, including trust, attachment, social perception and fear-regulation. Previous studies have demonstrated that intranasal administration of OT reduces subjective and neuroendocrine stress responses and dampens amygdala reactivity. Moreover, OT has been proposed to modulate activity of the autonomic nervous system.
	Here, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 56 men, to investigate whether a single-dose of OT (24 IU) modulates sympathetic autonomic arousal upon live dyadic gaze interactions. To do so, electro-dermal recordings of skin conductance were performed during the engagement of eye contact with a live model in a naturalistic two-person social context.
	In accordance to prior research, direct eye gaze elicited a significant enhancement in skin conductance responses, but OT did not specifically enhance or dampen the overall magnitude (amplitude) of the autonomic arousal response. Administration of OT did facilitate the recovery of skin conductance responses back to baseline (increased steepness of recovery slope), indicating a role of OT in restoring homeostatic balance. Notably, the treatment-effect on autonomic recovery was most prominent in participants with low self-reported social responsiveness and high attachment avoidance, indicating that person-dependent factors play a pivotal role in determining OT treatment-responses. Behaviorally, OT significantly reduced self-reported feelings of tension and (at trend-level) worrying about how one presents oneself.
	Together, these observations add further evidence to a role of OT in reducing subjective and autonomic stress responses, primarily by facilitating restoration of homeostatic balance after (social) stress-induced perturbation.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020875v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020875v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"The Cognitive-Functional Composite is sensitive to clinical progression in early dementia: longitudinal findings from the Catch-Cog study cohort","Introduction: In an attempt to capture clinically meaningful cognitive decline in early dementia, we developed the Cognitive-Functional Composite (CFC). We investigated the CFC's sensitivity to decline in comparison to traditional clinical endpoints.
Methods: This longitudinal construct validation study included 148 participants with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. The CFC and traditional tests were administered at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Sensitivity to change was investigated using linear mixed models and R2 effect-sizes. 
Results: CFC scores declined over time (=-.16,p	<.001), with steepest decline observed in mild Alzheimer's dementia (=-.25,p	<.001). The CFC showed medium-to-large effect-sizes at succeeding follow-up points (R2=.08-.42), exhibiting greater change than the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (R2=.02-.12). Moreover, change on the CFC was significantly associated with informant reports of cognitive decline (=.38,p<.001).
Discussion: By showing sensitivity to decline, the CFC could enhance the monitoring of disease progression in dementia research and clinical practice.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020859v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020859v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Neurology

"Can increasing years of schooling reduce type 2 diabetes (T2D)?--Evidence from a Mendelian randomization of T2D and 10 of its risk factors.","A focus in recent decades has involved examining the potential causal impact of educational attainment (schooling years) on a variety of disease and life-expectancy outcomes. Numerous studies have broadly revealed a link suggesting that as years of formal schooling increase so too does health and wellbeing; however, it is unclear whether the associations are causal. Here we use Mendelian randomization, an instrumental variables technique, to probe whether more years of schooling are causally linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 10 of its risk factors. The results reveal a protective effect of more schooling years against T2D (odds ratio=0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.26, 0.58; P=3.89 x 10-06), which might be mediated in part by more years of schooling being protective against the following: having a first-degree relative with diabetes, being overweight, and having high blood pressure, higher levels of circulating triglycerides, and lower levels of HDL cholesterol. More schooling years had no effect on risk for gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome and was associated with a decreased likelihood of moderate physical activity. These findings imply that strategies to retain adults in higher education may help reduce the risk for a major source of metabolic morbidity and mortality.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020701v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020701v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Epidemiology

"Transcranial magnetic stimulation language mapping analysis revisited: Machine learning classification of 90 patients reveals distinct reorganization pattern in aphasic patients.","Repetitive TMS (rTMS) allows to non-invasively and transiently disrupt local neuronal functioning. Its potential for mapping of language function is currently explored. Given the inter- individual heterogeneity of tumor impact on the language network and resulting rTMS derived functional mapping, we propose to use machine learning strategies to classify potential patterns of functional reorganization. We retrospectively included 90 patients with left perisylvian glioma tumors, world health organization (WHO) grade II-IV, affecting the language network. All patients underwent navigated rTMS language mappings. The severity of aphasia was assessed preoperatively using the Berlin Aphasia Score (BAS), which is adapted to the Aachener Aphasia Test (AAT). After spatial normalization to MNI 152 of all rTMS spots, we calculated the error rate (ER) in each cortical area by automated anatomical labeling parcellation (AAL) and used support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier for significant areas in relation to aphasia. 29 of 90 (32.2%) patients suffered from aphasia. Univariate analysis revealed 11 perisylvian AVOIs' ERs (eight left, three right hemispheric) that were significantly higher in the aphasic than non-aphasic group (p < 0.05), depicting a broad, bihemispheric language network. After feeding the significant AVOIs into the SVM model, it showed that additional to age (w = 2.95), the ERs of right Frontal_Inf_Tri (w = 2.06) and left SupraMarginal (w = 2.05) and Parietal_Inf (w= 1.80) contributed more than other features to the model. The model's sensitivity was 89.7%, the specificity was 82.0%, the overall accuracy was 81.1% and AUC was 88.7%. Our results demonstrate an increased vulnerability of the right inferior frontal gyrus to rTMS in patients suffering from aphasia due to left perisylvian gliomas. This confirms a functional relevant involvement of the right frontal area in relation to aphasia. While age as a feature improved our SVM model the most, the tumor location feature didn't affect the SVM model. This finding indicates that general tumor induced network disconnection is relevant to aphasia and not necessarily related to specific lesion locations. Additionally, our results emphasize the decreasing potential for neuroplasticity with age.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020693v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020693v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Neurology

"A novel mechanism of HIF2-dependent PLK1-mediated metastasis and drug resistance of clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma","Polo-Like Kinase 1 (Plk1) expression is inversely correlated with survival advantages in many cancers. However, molecular mechanisms that underlie Plk1 expression are poorly understood. Here, we uncover a novel hypoxia-regulated mechanism of Plk1-mediated cancer metastasis and drug resistance. We demonstrated that a new HIF-2-dependent regulatory pathway drives Plk1 expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Mechanistically, HIF-2 transcriptionally targets the hypoxia response element of the Plk1 promoter. In ccRCC patients, high expression of Plk1 was correlated to poor disease-free survival and overall survival. Loss-of-function of Plk1 in vivo markedly attenuated ccRCC growth and metastasis. High Plk1 expression conferred a resistant phenotype of ccRCC to targeted therapeutics such as sunitinib, in vitro, in vivo and in metastatic ccRCC patients. Importantly, high Plk1 expression was defined in a subpopulation of ccRCC patients that are refractory to current therapies. Hence, we propose a therapeutic paradigm for improving outcomes of ccRCC patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020552v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020552v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Oncology

"ACE2 expression by colonic epithelial cells is associated with viral infection, immunity and energy metabolism","Respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and spread rapidly to other provinces and other countries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020545v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020545v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Allergy and Immunology

"Cost-effectiveness of real-world administration of chemotherapy and add-on Viscum album L. therapy compared to chemotherapy alone in the treatment of stage IV NSCLC patients","Background: For stage IV lung cancer patients receiving add-on Viscum album L. treatment an improved overall survival (OS) was observed. Only limited information regarding cost-effectiveness (CE) for comparisons between standard of care and standard of care plus add-on VA in stage IV lung cancer treatment is available. The present study assessed the costs and cost-effectiveness of standard of care plus VA (V) compared to standard of care alone (C) for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treatment in a hospital in Germany.
Methods: An observational study was conducted using data from the Network Oncology clinical registry. Patients included had stage IV lung cancer at diagnosis and received C or V treatment in a certified German Cancer Center. Cost and cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) including the analysis of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were performed from the hospital's perspective based on routine data from financial controlling department and observed data on OS. The primary result of the analysis was tested for robustness in a bootstrap-based sensitivity analysis. 
Results: 118 patients (C: n=86, V: n=32) were included, mean age 63.8 years, proportion of male patients 55.1%. Adjusted hospital's total mean costs for patients from the C and V group were 16,289 (over an adjusted mean OS time of 13.4 months) and 17,992 (over an adjusted mean OS time of 19.1 months), respectively. The costs per additional OS year gained (ICER) with the V-treatment compared to C were 3,586.  
Conclusion: Based on our analysis, the assessment of inpatient costs and cost-effectiveness of IO concepts in stage IV lung cancer suggests that the combined use of chemotherapy and VA is clinically effective and was comparably cost-effective to chemotherapy alone in our analysed patient sample. Further randomized and prospective cost-effectiveness studies are mandatory to complement our findings.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020354v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020354v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Oncology

"Estimation of hepatitis B virus cccDNA persistence in chronic infection using within-host evolutionary rates","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health problem with over 240 million infected individuals at risk of developing progressive liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV is an enveloped DNA virus that establishes its genome as an episomal, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes. Currently available standard-of-care treatments for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) include nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) that suppress HBV replication but do not target the cccDNA and hence rarely cure infection. There is considerable interest in determining the lifespan of cccDNA molecules to design and evaluate new curative treatments. We took a novel approach to this problem by developing a new mathematical framework to model changes in evolutionary rates during infection which, combined with previously determined within-host evolutionary rates of HBV, we used to determine the lifespan of cccDNA. We estimate that during HBe-antigen positive (HBeAgPOS) infection the cccDNA lifespan is 61 (36-236) days, whereas during the HBeAgNEG phase of infection it is only 26 (16-81) days. We found that cccDNA replicative capacity declined by an order of magnitude between HBeAgPOS and HBeAgNEG phases of infection. Our estimated lifespan of cccDNA is too short to explain the long durations of chronic infection observed in patients on NA treatment, suggesting that either a sub-population of long-lived hepatocytes harbouring cccDNA molecules persists during therapy, or that NA therapy does not suppress all viral replication. These results provide a greater understanding of the biology of the cccDNA reservoir and can aid the development of new curative therapeutic strategies for treating CHB.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020362v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020362v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Machine Learning Can Predict Deaths in Patients with Diverticulitis During their Hospital Stay","Introduction: Diverticulitis is the inflammation and/or infection of small pouches known as diverticula that develop along the walls of the intestines. Patients with diverticulitis are at risk of mortality as high as 17% with abscess formation and 45% with secondary perforation, especially patients that get admitted to the inpatient services are at risk of complications including mortality. We developed a deep neural networks (DNN) based machine learning framework that could predict premature death in patients that are admitted with diverticulitis using electronic health records (EHR) to calculate the statistically significant risk factors first and then to apply deep neural network.
Methods: Our proposed framework (Deep FLAIM) is a two-phase hybrid works framework. In the first phase, we used National In-patient Sample 2014 dataset to extract patients with diverticulitis patients with and without hemorrhage with the ICD-9 codes 562.11 and 562.13 respectively and analyzed these patients for different risk factors for statistical significance with  univariate and multivariate analyses to generate hazard ratios, to rank the diverticulitis associated risk factors. In the second phase, we applied deep neural network model to predict death. Additionally, we have compared the performance of our proposed system by using the popular machine learning models such as DNN and Logistic Regression (LR).
Results: A total of 128,258 patients were used, we tested 64 different variables for using univariate and multivariate (age, gender and ethnicity) cox-regression for significance only 16 factors were statistically significant for both univariate and multivariate analysis. The mortality prediction for our DNN out-performed the conventional machine learning (logistic regression) in terms of AUC (0.977 vs 0.904), training accuracy (0.931 vs 0.900), testing accuracy (0.930 vs 0.910) , sensitivity (90% vs 88%) and specificity (95% vs 93%).   
Conclusion: Our FLAIM-DNN-4RS can predict mortality in patients admitted to the hospital with diverticulitis with high accuracy. The proposed framework can be expanded to predict premature death for other disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020222v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020222v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Health Informatics

"Evidence that telomere length is causal for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis but not Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Mendelian Randomisation Study","Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease accounting for 1% of UK deaths. In the familial form of pulmonary fibrosis, causal genes have been identified in ~30% of cases, and a majority relate to telomere maintenance. Prematurely shortened leukocyte telomere length has also been associated with IPF, as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease with a similar demographic and shared risk factors. Using Mendelian randomisation (MR), our study aimed to determine whether short telomeres cause IPF or COPD.

Methods: We performed an MR study for telomere length causality in IPF and COPD with up to 1,369 IPF cases, 14,103 COPD cases and 435,866 controls of European ancestry in UK Biobank. Initial studies using polygenic risk scores followed by two-sample MR analyses were carried out using seven genetic variants previously associated with telomere length, with replication analysis in an IPF cohort of 2,668 IPF cases and 8,591 controls and a COPD cohort of 15,256 cases and 47,936 controls.

Findings: Meta-analysis of the two-sample MR results provided evidence that shorter telomeres cause IPF, with a genetically instrumented one standard deviation shorter telomere length associated with 5.81 higher odds of IPF ([95% CI: 3.56-9.50], P=2.19x10-12. Despite being an age-related lung disease with overlapping risk, there was no evidence that telomere length caused COPD (OR 1.07, [95% CI 0.90-1.27], P = 0.46). 

Interpretation: Cellular senescence is hypothesised as a major driving force in both IPF and COPD; telomere shortening may be a contributory factor in IPF, suggesting divergent mechanisms in COPD. This enables greater focus in telomere-related diagnostics, treatments and the search for a cure in IPF. Therapies manifesting improvements in telomere length, including safe telomere activation therapy, may warrant investigation.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20019653v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20019653v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Respiratory Medicine

"Epigenetic biomarkers of ageing are predictive of mortality risk in a longitudinal clinical cohort of individuals diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer.","Background: Epigenetic clocks are biomarkers of ageing derived from DNA methylation levels at a subset of CpG sites. The difference between predicted age from these clocks and chronological age (epigenetic age acceleration) has been shown to predict age-related disease and mortality. We aimed to assess the prognostic value of epigenetic age acceleration with all-cause mortality in a prospective clinical cohort of individuals with head and neck cancer: Head and Neck 5000. Methods: We investigated two markers of intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAAHorvath and IEAAHannum), one marker of extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA), one optimised to predict physiological dysregulation (AgeAccelPheno) and one optimised to predict lifespan (AgeAccelGrim). Cox regression models were first used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of epigenetic age acceleration with all-cause mortality in people with oropharyngeal cancer (n=408;105 deaths). The added prognostic value of epigenetic measures compared to a clinical model including age, gender, TNM stage and HPV status was then evaluated. Results: IEAAHannum and AgeAccelGrim were associated with mortality risk after adjustment for clinical and lifestyle factors [HRs per standard deviation (SD) increase in age acceleration =1.32 (95% CI=1.08, 1.61; p=0.007) and 1.39 (95% CI =1.06, 1.83; p=0.017), respectively]. There was weak evidence that the addition of AgeAccelGrim to the clinical model improved 3-year mortality prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.80 vs. 0.77; p-value for difference=0.069). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the potential of epigenetic age acceleration measures to enhance survival prediction in people with oropharyngeal cancer, beyond established prognostic factors.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020198v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020198v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Epidemiology

"Approaches used to enhance transition and retention for newly qualified nurses (NQNs): a rapid evidence assessment","Aim:
To undertake a rapid evidence assessment of approaches used to enhance nurse transition and retention for NQNs.
Design:
A rapid evidence assessment.
Data sources
Electronic databases (CINAHL complete, Academic search premier, Open Grey, ERIC* (Education), Web of Science--Social Science Citation Index and PubMed)
Review methods:
A rapid evidence assessment (REA) was undertaken to gain an overview of the density and quality of evidence on nurse transition and retention from student to Registered Nurse.  Electronic databases were searched, and the full texts of relevant papers were retrieved and classified according to methodology.  Studies were appraised using relevant CASP and MMAT tools and a single descriptor of quality: high; medium; or low was assigned to each output. Given the disparity in methods, the lack of randomized trials, results could not be combined; therefore, a descriptive approach was used to synthesise and present the data.
Result:
Orientation and creating supportive environments were frequently reported as being effective in enhancing transition across a range of studies. A range of methods: quasi-experimental, survey and qualitative were used. Generally speaking the quality of most studies was poor.

Conclusions: Despite decades of research into the experiences of NQNs and development of schemes and frameworks to support them during this period, there is little substantive or robust evidence in terms of impact on retention. Further research into the longer-term retention of NQNs is recommended.  Longitudinal studies would be beneficial in assessing the efficacy of approaches to enhancing retention.
Impact: Nurse managers need to work with education providers to facilitate experiences for final year nursing students to ease transition and also implement effective evidence based practices during the first year of registration and monitor the impact of this on retention.

"Preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against introductions of 2019-nCoV","The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic has spread to 23 countries from China. Local cycles of transmission already occurred in 7 countries following case importation. No African country has reported cases yet. The management and control of 2019-nCoV introductions heavily relies on the public health capacity of a country. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. 
Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively. 
Interpretation: Several countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with 2019-nCoV importations. Resources and intensified surveillance and capacity capacity should be urgently prioritized towards countries at moderate risk that may be ill-prepared to face the importation and to limit onward transmission.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020792v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020792v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Public and Global Health

"Transmission and epidemiological characteristics of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-Infected Pneumonia(NCIP):preliminary evidence obtained in comparison with 2003-SARS","[Abstract] Objectives Latest epidemic information of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-Infected Pneumonia (NCIP) was collected and a detailed statistical analysis was carried out to make comparison with 2003-SARS in order to provide scientific reference for the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV. Methods The information of NCIP and 2003-SARS from websites of NHCPRC and the World Health Organization was collected, and then the transmission dynamics of the two kinds of infectious diseases were analyzed. The information of 287 confirmed NCIP patients obtained from the website of health committees of 16 provinces. A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the NCIP epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed NCIP case data. Results The growth rate of new cases and deaths of NCIP were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 287 confirmed NCIP cases aged 9 months to 90 years and the average age was (42.38 15.97) years. The gender ratio (M: F) was 1.35: 1. The numbers of NCIP patients in Wuhan and other inland areas were in line with Y=0.7209 x3-11.97x2+59.129x (R2=0.9858) and Y=2.2169 x3-39.74x2+158.88x (R2=0.9357),respectively, with good fitting effects judging by their R2 values. Conclusions The fatality rate of NCIP is lower than that of 2003-SARS and the cure rate is higher. The age of NCIP patients is mainly concentrated in the 30-50 years old (68.29%). The harm of the first-generation NCIP patients is indeed higher than that of secondary cases.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019836v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019836v2.full.pdf","2020-02-10",NA,"Zhang","/highwire/citation/71949/bibtext",1,"110220-1","11/02/2020","71949"
"Forecasting the Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemics using a simple (simplistic) model - update (Feb. 8, 2020)","Confirmed infection cases in mainland China were analyzed using the data up to January 28, 2020 (first 13 days of reliable confirmed cases). For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. As data become available, we subsequently analyzed them during three consecutive periods obtaining a sequence of model predictions. All available data up were processed the same way. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data. Using this model and the three sets of data, we estimated maximum cases as about 21,000, 28,000 and 35,000 cases refining these predictions in near-real time. With slightly different approach (linearization in time) the estimate of maximum cases was even higher (about 65,000).  Although the estimates of maximum cases increase as more data were reported all models show reaching a peak in mid-February in contrast to the unconfined exponential growth. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020461v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020461v2.full.pdf","2020-02-10",NA,"Hermanowicz","/highwire/citation/71948/bibtext",2,"110220-2","11/02/2020","71948"
"Genome-wide investigation of DNA methylation in congenital adrenal hyperplasia","Background:
Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are at risk of long-term cognitive and metabolic sequelae. This study investigates genome-wide DNA methylation in patients with CAH to determine whether there is evidence for epigenomic reprogramming as well as any relationship to patient outcome.
Methods:
We analysed CD4+ T cell DNA from 28 patients with CAH (mean age=18.5 6.5 years [y]) and 37 population controls (mean age=17.0 6.1 y) with the Infinium-HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array to measure genome-wide locus-specific DNA methylation levels. Effects of CAH, phenotype and CYP21A2 genotype on methylation were investigated as well as the association between differentially methylated CpGs, metabolic profiles (glucose homeostasis and blood lipid profile) and cognitive outcome. In addition, we report data on a small cohort of 11 patients (mean age=19.1, 6.0 y) with CAH who were treated prenatally with dexamethasone (DEX).
Results:
We identified two CpGs to be associated with patient phenotype: cg18486102 (located in the FAIM2 gene; rho=0.58, adjusted p=0.027) and cg02404636 (located in the SFI1 gene; rho=0.58, adjusted p=0.038). cg02404636 was also associated with genotype (rho=0.59, adjusted p=0.024). We did not observe any effect of DEX on DNA methylation in individuals with CAH. No significant association was found between FAIM2 methylation and cognitive or metabolic outcome. However, SFI1 TSS methylation was associated with fasting plasma HDL cholesterol levels (p=0.035).
Conclusion:
In conclusion, higher methylation levels in CpG sites covering FAIM2 and SFI1 were associated with disease severity. Hypermethylation in these genes may have implications for long-term cognitive and metabolic outcome in patients with CAH.","/content/10.1101/19008524v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008524v2.full.pdf","2020-02-10",NA,"Karlsson","/highwire/citation/71947/bibtext",3,"110220-3","11/02/2020","71947"
"Global DNA hypomethylation in epithelial ovarian cancer: passive demethylation and association with genomic instability","A hallmark of human cancer is global DNA hypomethylation (GDHO), but the mechanisms accounting for this defect and its pathological consequences have not been defined in human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).  In EOC, GDHO was associated with advanced disease and reduced overall and disease-free survival.  GDHO(+) EOC was enriched for a proliferative gene expression signature, including CCNE1 and FOXM1 overexpression.  DNA hypomethylation preferentially occurred within genomic blocks (hypomethylated blocks) overlapping late-replicating, lamina-associated domains, PRC2 binding, and H3K27me3.  Increased proliferation coupled with hypomethylated block formation at late replicating regions suggested passive hypomethylation, which was further supported by the observation that cytosine DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and UHRF1 showed significantly reduced expression in GDHO(+) EOC, after normalization to proliferation markers.   Importantly, GDHO(+) EOC showed elevated chromosomal instability (CIN), and copy number alterations (CNA) were enriched at hypomethylated blocks.  Together, these findings implicate a passive demethylation mechanism for GDHO that promotes genomic instability and poor prognosis in EOC.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018374v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018374v2.full.pdf","2020-02-10",NA,"Zhang","/highwire/citation/71946/bibtext",4,"110220-4","11/02/2020","71946"

"Violin plot data: A concerto of crucial information on valve thrombogenicity classified using laboratory measured valve motion","Abstract:
Objectives 
This in vitro study compares mechanical (MHV) and bioprosthetic (BHV) heart valves for high amplitude short duration regional flow velocities (RFV) near valve closure.
Background 
We previously tested several clinical and prototype valves and observed RFV at levels which may be related to a dimensionless thrombogenic potential (TP).  
Methods 
A total of four valves were tested in aortic and mitral sites under pulsatile circulation in a pulse duplicator. Valves included both clinical models and experimental prototypes. An optical approach measuring projected dynamic valve area (PDVA) to gauge valve motion was implemented. Pulsatile pressures and flow rates were measured by conventional techniques and a quasi-steady flow tester was used to measure valve leakage. RFV was derived using time-dependent volumetric flow rate/PDVA. Since flow velocity and fluid shear force are related through flow velocity gradient, TPs for valves that achieve near closure during the forward flow deceleration phase were determined as RFVs relative to the control mechanical valve RFV value of -126 m/s.  
Results
TP is dimensionless and ranged between -0.45 and +1.0. Negative TPs arise when transient rebound of valve occluders is accompanied by water-hammer phenomena. Positive TPs occur during the decelerating forward flow. Bioprostheses had lowest TP transient of 0.15 with exception of a mock-transcatheter aortic valve (mTAVI) that incorporated by design a trivial perivalvular leak (~1.35 ml/s). This device demonstrated a remarkably high transient TP of 0.95. The control mechanical valves had the highest TP of 1.0. The study implicates TP transients near mechanical valve closure, and not forward or non-flow phases, as primary to shear induced activation of the coagulation cascade.
Conclusions
Our data reveals distinct TP profile differences between valve models. If verifiable, the design of future valves may utilize currently available experimental tools to determine TPs resulting in advanced devices with significantly reduced TP.","/content/10.1101/19009407v6?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009407v6.full.pdf","2020-02-10",NA,"SCOTTEN","/highwire/citation/71923/bibtext",6,"110220-6","11/02/2020","71923"
"Predicting successes and failures of clinical trials with an ensemble LS-SVR","For a variety of reasons, most drug candidates cannot eventually pass the drug approval process. Thus, developing reliable methods for predicting clinical trial outcomes of drug  candidates is crucial in improving the success rate of drug discovery and development. In this study, we propose an ensemble classifier based on weighted least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) for predicting successes and failures of clinical trials. The efficacy of the proposed ensemble classifier is demonstrated through an experimental study on PrOCTOR dataset, which consists of informative chemical features of the drugs and target-based features. Comparing random forest and other models, the proposed ensemble classifier obtains the highest value for the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC). The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed ensemble classifier can be used to effectively predict drug approvals.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020636v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020636v1.full.pdf","2020-02-10","Toxicology

"Major discrepancy between factual antibiotic resistance and consumption in South of France: analysis of 539,037 bacterial strains.","Introduction: The burden of antibiotic resistance is currently estimated by mathematical modeling, without real count of resistance to key antibiotics. Here we report the real rate of resistance to key antibiotics in bacteria isolated from humans during a 5 years period in a large area in southeast in France.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on antibiotic susceptibility of 539,107 clinical strains isolated from hospital and private laboratories in south of France area from January 2014 to January 2019. The resistance rate to key antibiotics as well as the proportion of bacteria classified as Difficult-to-Treat (DTR) were determined and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test, the Chi-test or the Fisher's exact test. 
Results: Among 539,037 isolates, we did not observe any significant increase or decrease in resistance to key antibiotics for 5 years, (oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem resistance in enterobacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3rd generation cephalosporin resistance in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). However, we observed a significant decrease in imipenem resistance for Acinetobacter baumannii from 2014 to 2018 (24.19% to 12.27%; p=0.005) and a significant increase of ceftriaxone resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.9% to 24,03%; p=0.001) and Enterobacter cloacae (24,05% to 42,05%; p=0.004). Of these 539,037 isolates, 1,604 (0.3%) had a DTR phenotype. 
Conclusion: Over a 5-year period, we did not observe a burden of AR in our region despite a high rate of antibiotic consumption in our country. These results highlight the need for implementation of real-time AR surveillance systems which use factual data.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.19016188v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.19016188v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed four large-scale datasets of normal lung tissue to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression. No significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression were found between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in smoker samples compared to non-smoker samples. This indicates the smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and thus smoking history should be considered in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Nomogram for the prediction of in-hospital incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with acute pancreatitis","Abstract
Objective: The aim of this study was to formulate and validate an individualized predictive nomogram for in-hospital incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with acute pancreatitis(AP).
Design: AP patients were randomly distributed into primary cohort and validation cohort. Based on the primary cohort, risk factors were identified by logistic regression model and a nomogram was performed. The nomogram was validated in the primary and validation cohort by the bootstrap validation method. The calibration curve was applied to evaluate the consistency between nomogram and ideal observation.
Setting: Departments of Emergency Medicine of two university-affiliated tertiary hospitals.
Participants: From January 2017 to December 2018, 779 individuals with AP were included in this study.
Primary outcome measures: The in-hospital incidence of ARDS was assessed.
Results: There were 728 patients in the non-ARDS group and 51patients in the ARDS group, with an incidence rate of about 6.55%. Five independent factors including white blood counts(WBC),prothrombin time(PT),albumin(ALB),serum creatinine(SCR)and triglyceride (TG) were associated with in-hospital incidence of ARDS in AP patients.  A nomogram was constructed based on the five independent factors with primary cohort of AUC 0.821 and validation cohort of AUC 0.822. Calibration curve analysis indicated that the predicted probability was in accordance with the observed probability in both primary and validation cohorts.
Conclusions: The study developed an intuitive nomogram with easily available laboratory parameters for the prediction of in-hospital incidence of ARDS in patients with AP. The incidence of ARDS for an individual patient can be fast and conveniently evaluated by our nomogram.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20019513v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20019513v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Emergency Medicine

"A New Model to Determine the Personal Reference Interval of Tests in Laboratory Medicine: A Preliminary Study","The concept of personalized medicine has become popular within the last decade. However, personalized medicine needs correct diagnosis and monitoring of patients which can be done by using personalized reference intervals of laboratory tests. In this paper we proposed a model based on within subject biological variation to calculate the personalized reference intervals of tests requested by physicians for the diagnosis of diseases. We used the data of adult patients admitted to check-up units and calculated the personal reference intervals. If the patients are on steady-state, only a few data are sufficient to calculate the personal reference intervals. The model is very simple and can be used by physicians safely and easily.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20020446v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20020446v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Pathology

"Diarrhea may be underestimated: a missing link in 2019 novel coronavirus","The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan City, China. However, the clinical symptoms varied in different reports. Based on the results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed in three recent reports. As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020289v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020289v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Gastroenterology

"Cognitive impairments in sporadic cerebral small vessel disease (SVD): a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohorts with stroke, dementia and non-clinical presentations of SVD","Background: Cognitive impairment is a key clinical feature of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), but the full range of SVD-related cognitive impairments is unclear, and little is known about how they might vary across clinical and non-clinical manifestations of SVD.
Methods: In systematic searches of OVID MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO from 1st January 1985 to 6th October 2019, we identified studies reporting cognitive test results for study participants with SVD and control participants without SVD. Using standardised group-level cognitive test data, we performed random effects meta-analyses in seven cognitive domains to test whether cognitive test scores differed between SVD and control groups. We conducted meta-regression analyses to test whether differences in age, education, or vascular risk factors between SVD and control groups, or whether different clinical manifestations of SVD (e.g. stroke, cognitive impairment, or non-clinical presentations) accounted for cognitive effect sizes.
Findings: Of 8562 studies identified, we included 69 studies from six continents, published in four languages. These studies included 3229 participants with SVD and 3679 controls. Meta-analyses demonstrated that on average, control groups outperformed SVD cohorts on cognitive tests in all cognitive domains examined: executive function (estimate: -0.928; 95%CI: -1.08, -0.78); processing speed (-0.885; -1.17, -0.60); delayed memory (-0.898; -1.10, -0.69); language (-0.808; -1.01, -0.60); visuospatial ability (-0.720; -0.96, -0.48); reasoning (-0.634; -0.93, -0.34); and attention (-0.622; -0.94, -0.31; all p=0.001). Meta-regression analyses suggested that differences in years of education between SVD and control groups may account for a proportion of the differences in performance on tests of executive function, visuospatial ability and language, and that cohorts with cognitive impairments performed more poorly on tests of executive function, delayed memory and visuospatial ability than cohorts with stroke or non-clinical presentations of SVD.
Interpretation: Participants with SVD demonstrated poorer cognitive performance relative to control groups in all cognitive domains we examined. This effect was present for all presentations of SVD, reinforcing the need to test a range of cognitive domains in both clinical and research settings. Lower levels of education in SVD versus control participants may contribute to these effects, highlighting the need to account for educational level in the assessment of SVD-related cognitive impairment.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20020628v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20020628v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Neurology

"Continuous Aerosol Medication Therapy in an in vitro High Flow System Using Wire Mesh Technology","BACKGROUND: Jet nebulizers are commonly used to provide continuous aerosolized medication therapy (CAMT). We observed the function of our CAMT system that utilizes the Aeroneb Solo nebulizer system (Aerogen Ltd, Galway, Ireland). METHODS: An observational study was performed on 2 CAMT systems with 15 Aeroneb nebulizers for each system. CAMT was simulated for 1, 2 and 3 hours. Continuous nebulization was monitored and residual volumes were recorded at the end of each simulation. Our primary endpoint was established as intermittent nebulization observed by nebulizer filling of > 1 ml during CAMT simulation. Secondary endpoint was a residual volume of < 0.1 ml. RESULTS: Out of 30 simulations in two arms, a fluid level was observed to accumulate intermittently in three nebulizers with a residual volume of 0.7 mls in one of these three. This produced a total success rate of 90%, Arm-A 80%, Arm B-100%, for our primary endpoint. Our secondary endpoint was achieved in 29 of the 30 nebulizers for an overall 97% success rate, Arm A-93%, Arm B-100%. CONCLUSION: Our Aerogen Solo CAMT system successfully emitted the set dose with 90% accuracy.

"Going off the rails: Impaired coherence in the speech of patients with semantic control deficits","The ability to speak coherently, maintaining focus on the topic at hand, is critical for effective communication and is commonly impaired following brain damage. Recent data suggests that executive processes that regulate access to semantic knowledge (i.e., semantic control) are critical for maintaining coherence during speech. To test this hypothesis, we assessed speech coherence in a case-series of fluent stroke aphasic patients with deficits in semantic control. Patients were asked to speak about a series of topics and their responses were analysed using computational linguistic methods to derive measures of their global coherence (the degree to which they spoke about the topic given) and local coherence (the degree to which they maintained a topic from one moment to the next). Compared with age-matched controls, patients showed severe impairments to global coherence and milder impairments to local coherence, suggesting that semantic control deficits give rise to being 'led up the garden path', i.e., one sentence automatically cueing another, with the topic becoming increasingly less relevant to the original question. Global coherence was strongly correlated with the patients' performance on tests of semantic control, with poorer ability to maintain top-down global coherence being associated with greater semantic control deficits. Other aspects of speech production were also impaired but were not correlated with semantic control deficits. This is the first study to investigate the impact of semantic control impairments within a naturalistic setting, and indicates patients with these impairments are likely to find maintaining focus in everyday conversation difficult.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20020685v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20020685v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Neurology

We aim to devise novel ways to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in order to help researchers and other people involved in crisis response to make well-informed and targeted decisions about from which geographical locations and time periods more genetic samples may be required to fully understand the outbreak. Our approach relies on the application of Transcendental Information Cascades to a set of temporally ordered nucleotide sequences and we apply it to real-world data that was collected during the currently ongoing outbreak of the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus. We assess information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures that characterise the resulting complex network and suggest touching points and temporal pathways that are of interest for deeper investigation by geneticists and epidemiologists.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021139v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021139v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

"Eicosanoid Inflammatory Mediators Are Robustly Associated with Blood Pressure in the General Population","Background: Epidemiologic and animal studies have associated systemic inflammation with blood pressure (BP). However, the mechanistic factors linking inflammation and BP remain unknown. Fatty acid derived eicosanoids serve as mediators of inflammation and have been suggested to also regulate renal vascular tone, peripheral resistance, renin-angiotensin system, and endothelial function. We therefore hypothesize that specific pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids modulate BP.

Methods: In N=8099 FINRISK 2002 cohort participants randomly drawn from the Finnish population register (53% women, mean age 4813 years), we profiled 545 distinct high-quality eicosanoids and related oxylipin mediators in plasma using non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In models adjusted for conventional hypertension risk factors, we analyzed the associations of eicosanoids and eicosanoid profiles with systolic BP and hypertension. We used the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring study (N=2859) as the replication cohort.

Results: We observed 187 eicosanoids (34%) significantly associated with systolic BP (P < Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 0.05/545). 175 of these associations were positive and 12 were negative. Due to strong correlations between the eicosanoids, we used forward selection linear regression modeling to identify six eicosanoids independently related to systolic BP. A risk score based on these six eicosanoids was related to 40% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33-48%) and 32% (95% CI, 21-44%) greater odds of hypertension in FINRISK and FHS, respectively, per 1-SD score increase. Individuals in the upper quartile of the six-eicosanoid risk score had 2.26-fold greater odds (95% CI, 1.96-2.62) of prevalent hypertension in FINRISK, compared with those in the lowest quartile. These findings were successfully replicated in an independent cohort of FHS participants.

Conclusions: Plasma eicosanoids demonstrate strong associations with BP in the general population. Intriguingly, we observed specific protective molecules as well as harmful molecules. As eicosanoid compounds affect numerous physiological processes that are central to BP regulation, they may offer new insights regarding pathogenesis of hypertension, as well as serve as new targets for therapeutic intervention.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021022v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021022v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Cardiovascular Medicine

"The Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is Highly Contagious and More Infectious Than Initially Estimated","The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

"Predicting and elucidating the etiology of fatty liver disease using a machine learning-based approach: an IMI DIRECT study","Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent and causes serious health complications in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and beyond. Early diagnosis of NAFLD is important, as this can help prevent irreversible damage to the liver and ultimately hepatocellular carcinomas. 
Methods and Findings: Utilizing the baseline data from the IMI DIRECT participants (n=1514) we sought to expand etiological understanding and develop a diagnostic tool for NAFLD using machine learning. Multi-omic (genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) and clinical (liver enzymes and other serological biomarkers, anthropometry, and measures of beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and lifestyle) data comprised the key input variables. The models were trained on MRI image-derived liver fat content (<5% or >=5%). We applied LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) to select features from the different layers of omics data and Random Forest analysis to develop the models. The prediction models included clinical and omics variables separately or in combination. A model including all omics and clinical variables yielded a cross-validated receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (ROCAUC) of 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.82, 0.86), which compared with a ROCAUC of 0.82 (95% CI=0.81, 0.83) for a model including nine clinically-accessible variables. The IMI DIRECT prediction models out-performed existing non-invasive NAFLD prediction tools. 
Conclusions: We have developed clinically useful liver fat prediction models (see: www.predictliverfat.org) and identified biological features that appear to affect liver fat accumulation.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021147v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021147v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Reported autism diagnosis strongly predicts psychotic-like experiences in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development cohort","Although the schizophrenia rate is increased in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it is difficult to identify which youth with ASD will go on to develop psychosis. We explored the relationship between ASD and emerging psychotic-like experiences in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort of school-aged children. We predicted that ASD would robustly predict psychotic-like experience severity, even relative to other established predictors, and that ASD youth with psychotic-like experiences would have a characteristic neurocognitive profile. In a sample of 9,130 youth aged 9-11, we fit regression models that included parent-reported ASD, family history of psychosis, lifetime trauma, executive function, processing speed, working memory, age, sex, race, ethnicity, and income-to-needs ratio as predictors of Prodromal Questionnaire - Brief Child (PQ-BC) score. We assessed cognitive profiles using analysis of variance on NIH Toolbox measures. ASD increased PQ-BC distress scores by 2.46 points (95% CI 1.32 - 3.60), an effect at least as large as those of family history of psychosis (1.05 points, 95% CI 0.56 - 1.53), Latinx ethnicity (0.99 points, 95% CI 0.52 - 1.45) and black race (0.89 points, 95% CI 0.30 - 1.48). We did not identify a unique cognitive profile for ASD youth with psychotic-like experiences. Our finding that ASD predicts psychotic-like symptoms in youth is consistent with previous literature, and adds new information in suggesting that ASD is a strong predictor of psychotic-like experiences even when compared to other established SCZ risk factors.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021170v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021170v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts","Background: To assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-nCoV.

Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. 

Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.

Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021162v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021162v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Public and Global Health

"Circular RNA and its mechanisms in diabetic retinopathy: a systematic review","Circular RNAs (CircRNAs) are endogenous long non-coding RNAs. Unlike linear RNAs, they are structurally continuous and covalently closed, without 5' caps or 3' polyadenylation tails. High-throughput RNA sequencing has enabled people to find several endogenous circRNAs in different species and tissues. circRNA mainly acts as a sponge for microRNAs in cytoplasm to regulates protein translation, or interacts with RNA-binding proteins to generate RNA protein complexes that control transcription. circRNAs are closely associated with diseases such as diabetes, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, which indicates that circRNAs are closely related to and also play an important functional role in the occurrence and development of human diseases. Recent studies have shown that they are differentially expressed in healthy and diseased eye tissues. There lacks of biomarkers for early detection of diabetic retinopathy, and the newly discovered circRNAs seem to be an ideal candidate of novel molecular markers and therapeutic targets. However, the molecular mechanism of circRNAs activity in the occurrence and development of diabetic retinopathy are not clear yet. This systematic review aims to summarize the research status on function and mechanism of circRNAs in regulating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021204v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021204v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Ophthalmology

We used the traffic flow data from Baidu Map, and number of air passengers who left Wuhan from 1st January to 26th January, to quantify the potential infectious people. We developed multiple linear models with local population and air passengers as predicted variables to explain the variance of confirmed cases in every city across China. We found the contribution of air passengers from Wuhan was decreasing gradually, but the effect of local population was increasing, indicating the trend of local transmission. However, the increase of local transmission is slow during the early stage of novel coronavirus, due to the super strict control measures carried out by government agents and communities.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021196v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021196v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

"Prevention of adrenal crisis: cortisol responses to major stress compared to stress dose hydrocortisone delivery in adrenal insufficiency","Context: Patients with adrenal insufficiency require increased hydrocortisone cover during major stress to avoid life-threatening adrenal crisis. However, current treatment recommendations are not evidence-based.
Objective: To identify the most appropriate mode of hydrocortisone delivery in patients with adrenal insufficiency exposed to major stress.
Design and Participants: Cross-sectional study: 122 unstressed healthy subjects and 288 subjects exposed to different stressors (major trauma [N=83], sepsis [N=100], and combat stress [N=105]). Longitudinal study: 22 patients with preserved adrenal function undergoing elective surgery. Pharmacokinetic study: 10 patients with primary adrenal insufficiency undergoing administration of 200mg hydrocortisone over 24 hours in four different delivery modes (continuous intravenous infusion; six-hourly oral, intramuscular or intravenous bolus administration).
Main Outcome Measure: We measured total serum cortisol and cortisone, free serum cortisol and urinary glucocorticoid metabolite excretion by mass spectrometry. Linear pharmacokinetic modelling was used to determine the most appropriate mode and dose of hydrocortisone administration in patients with adrenal insufficiency exposed to major stress.
Results: Serum cortisol was increased in all stress conditions, with the highest values observed in surgery and sepsis. Continuous intravenous hydrocortisone was the only administration mode persistently achieving median cortisol concentrations in the range observed during major stress. Linear pharmacokinetic modelling identified continuous intravenous infusion of 200mg hydrocortisone over 24 hours, preceded by an initial bolus of 50-100mg hydrocortisone, as best suited for maintaining cortisol concentrations in the required range.
Conclusions: Continuous intravenous hydrocortisone infusion should be favored over intermittent bolus administration in the prevention and treatment of adrenal crisis during major stress.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021246v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021246v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Estimation of the Time-Varying Reproduction Number of 2019-nCoV Outbreak in China","Background: The 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention. As of February 5, 2020, a total of 24433 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia associated with 2019-nCov were confirmed by the National Health Commission of China.
Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers.
Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days. Although the estimated controlled reproduction numbers R_c produced by all three methods in all different regions are significantly smaller compared with the basic reproduction numbers R_0, they are still greater than one.
Conclusions: Although the controlled reproduction number is declining, it is still larger than one. Additional efforts are needed to further reduce the R_c to below one in order to end the current epidemic.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021253v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021253v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

"The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","Motivated by the rapid spread of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of both domestic and international travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China.  The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021261v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021261v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

"Assessing the plausibility of subcritical transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States","Abstract: The 2019-nCoV outbreak has raised concern of global spread.  While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear.  Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States, which would allow endemic transmission.  As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission.  However, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021311v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021311v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

With no specific medicine, analysis of epidemic trends is critical for disease control and epidemic risk management. 

Methods: We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by Feburary 6, 2020. Considering the huge population migration during the spring festival of China, a Flow-SEIR model is proposed to perform empirical analysis. Assuming that most of people will go back to work from February 10 to the end of February, the risk of the coming migration from home to workplace is defined and estimated, based on the confirmed cases and the Spring Festival migration data. We use data from Baidu Migration to estimate the coming migration for returning to the workplace after vacation from February 10 to 28, 2020. The risk of migration for returning was then estimated. 

Main findings:
(1). The time when the number of daily new cases has reached a peak level, i.e. the national epidemic inflection point, is expected to be on February 7 - February 9. After the inflection point, the number of infected people will grow slowly and the epidemic will be gradually controlled. We define the temporal number of infected cases as the net cumulative number of cases. And the peak value represents the maximum of the net cumulative number, after this peak point, the current number of cases will gradually decrease and the epidemic will gradually subside. The predicted peak value of confirmed cases in Hubei can reach 62800 (56900 - 70300, 0.95 CI). The peak time in Hubei is on February 29 (Feb. 25 - Mar. 08, 0.95 CI). The peak arrival time of areas except Hubei will be in the interval of Mar.8 - Mar. 15, 2020. It will take about 1.5-2 months from the peak to the end of the epidemic. Most provinces have the predicted peak values less than 1000. The potential epidemic situation will be stable in March 2020- June 2020. 
(2). Rather than larger outbreak, the estimated number of infective patients in Hubei (in which Wuhan is located) presents a front and steep feature, manifesting the overall trend that the epidemic tends to be consistent.
(3). The necessary consciousness of self-protection and isolation is very effective for epidemic prevention and control. It can reduce the number of patients by nearly 90%. The effect of self-protection and isolation is stronger than the policy of traffic blockage. Provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of patients.
(4). Early warning of epidemic situation is very important. In the experimental environment, the results show that if there is 1 day in advance of the timely urban blockage, about 3600 people will eventually be reduced in the country. If there is 1 day of delay, about 1800 people will finally be at risk.
(5). Assuming that the false negative rate is 50% and the potential transmission rate is 1-4 times higher than that of the confirmed patients, the real peak number of patients is likely to be between 214400-472500. Suppose that the transmission rate of the false negative patient is twice that of the confirmed patient, if the false negative rate decreased by 5% in one week, the peak number of patients will slow down by 11.62%. If the proportion decreased by 10% in one week, the peak number of patients will decreased by 21.91%, which shows timely detection of false negative population is more effective for epidemic control.
(6). Under the natural condition, the return of Spring Festival transportation will aggravate the epidemic situation, especially for Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, Henan, Shanghai, Fujian and Beijing.

"Spatially Explicit Modeling of 2019-nCoV Epidemic Trend based on Mobile Phone Data in Mainland China","In December 2019, Wuhan, China reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of February 7, 2020, the total number of the confirmed cases in mainland China reached to 34,546 of whom 722 have died and 2,050 recovered. While most Chinese cities have confirmed cases, the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown. The aim of this study is to model the dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend under different scenarios in mainland China. We used mobile phone data and modified the classic epidemiological Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered (SIR) model to consider several  unique characteristics of the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in mainland China. The modified SIR model was trained using the confirmed cases from January 25 to February 1 and validated by the data collected on February 2, 2020. The prediction accuracy of new infected cases on February 2 (R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 18.24) is higher than using the classic SIR model (R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 40.18). We used the trained model to predict the trend in the next 30 days (up to March 2, 2020) under different scenarios: keeping the early-stage trend, controlling the disease as successfully as SARS in 2003, and increasing person-to-person contacts due to work/school resuming. Results show that the total infected population in mainland China will be 10.53, 0.15, and 0.41 million and 67%, 100%, 91% Chinese cities will control the virus spreading by March 2, 2020 under the above three scenarios. Our study also provides the city-level spatial pattern of the epidemic trend for decision makers to allocate resources for controlling virus spreading.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021360v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021360v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

"The lockdown of Hubei Province causing different transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan and Beijing","After the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) starting in late 2019, a number of researchers have reported the predicted the virus transmission dynamics. However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 10 in Wuhan and March 31 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave. The unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global outbreak of 2019-nCoV.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021477v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021477v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

"Transcutaneous Cervical Vagal Nerve Stimulation Blocks Sympathetic Responses to Stress in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder","Objective: Exacerbated autonomic responses to acute stress are prevalent in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of transcutaneous cervical VNS (tcVNS) on autonomic responses to acute stress in patients with PTSD. The authors hypothesized tcVNS would reduce the sympathetic response to stress compared to a sham device.
Methods: Using a randomized double-blind approach, the effects of tcVNS on physiological responses to stress were investigated in patients with PTSD (n=25) using noninvasive sensing modalities. Participants received either sham or active tcVNS after exposure to acute personalized traumatic script stress and mental stress (public speech, mental arithmetic) over a three-day protocol. Physiological parameters related to sympathetic responses to stress were investigated.
Results: Relative to sham, tcVNS paired to traumatic script stress decreased sympathetic function as measured by: decreased heart rate (-5.6%;  +-3.6%, p<0.01), increased photoplethysmogram amplitude (peripheral vasodilation) (30.8%; +-28%, p<0.05), and increased pulse arrival time (vascular function) (6.2%; +-1.9%, p<0.0001). Similar (p < 0.05) autonomic, cardiovascular, and vascular effects were observed when tcVNS was applied after mental stress or without acute stress.
Conclusion: tcVNS attenuates sympathetic arousal associated with stress related to traumatic memories as well as mental stress in patients with PTSD, with effects persisting throughout multiple traumatic stress and stimulation testing days. These findings show that tcVNS has beneficial effects on the underlying neurophysiology of PTSD. Such autonomic metrics may also be evaluated in daily life settings in tandem with tcVNS therapy to provide closed-loop delivery and measure efficacy.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021626v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021626v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"A non-APOE polygenic score for Alzheimer's disease and APOE-e4 have independent associations with dementia in the Health and Retirement Study","INTRODUCTION. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common and costly neurodegenerative disorder. A large proportion of risk is heritable and many genetic risk factors for AD have been identified. The cumulative genetic risk of known markers has not been benchmarked for dementia in a population-based sample.
METHODS. In the United States population-based Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (waves 1995-2014), we evaluated the role of cumulative genetic risk for AD, with and without the APOE-e4 alleles, on dementia status (dementia, cognitive impairment without dementia, borderline cognitive impairment without dementia, cognitively normal). We used logistic regression, accounting for demographic covariates and genetic principal components, and analyses were stratified by European and African genetic ancestry.
RESULTS. In the European ancestry sample (n=8399), both AD polygenic score excluding the APOE genetic region (odds ratio (OR)=1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.20) and the presence of any APOE-e4 alleles (OR=2.42; 95% CI: 1.99, 2.95) were associated with the odds of dementia relative to normal cognition in a mutually-adjusted model. In the African ancestry sample (n=1605), the presence of any APOE-e4 alleles was associated with 1.77 (95% CI: 1.20, 2.61) times higher odds of dementia, while the AD polygenic score excluding the APOE genetic region was not significantly associated with the odds of dementia relative to normal cognition 1.06 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.30).
DISCUSSION. Cumulative genetic risk for AD and APOE-e4 are both independent predictors of dementia. This study provides important insight into the polygenic nature of dementia and demonstrates the utility of polygenic scores in dementia research.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021667v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021667v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

"Epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China","Background: The ongoing outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has led to the declaration of Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization.
Methods: All 2019-nCoV infected patients reported to Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention up to 26 January 2020 were included for analysis. Disease and death incidence were compared between demographic groups and baseline conditions. Case fatality rates (CFRs) and the basic reproductive number R0 was estimated with a transmission model.
Results: As of 26 January 2020, a total of 8866 patients including 4021 (45.35%) laboratory confirmed patients were reported from 30 provinces. Nearly half of the patients were aged 50 years or older (47.7%). There was a clear gender difference in incidence with 0.31 (male) vs. 0.27 (female) per 100,000 people (P<0.001). The median incubation period was 4.75 (interquartile range: 3.0-7.2) days. About 25.5%, 69.9% and 4.5% patients were diagnosed with severe pneumonia, mild pneumonia, and non-pneumonia, respectively. The overall CFR was estimated be 3.06% (95% CI 2.02-4.59%), but male patients, =60 years old, baseline diagnosis of severe pneumonia and delay in diagnosis were associated with substantially elevated CFR. The R0 was estimated to be 3.77 (95% CI 3.51-4.05), ranging 2.23-4.82 in sensitivity analyses varying the incubation and infectious periods. 
Conclusions: Compared with SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV had comparable transmissibility and lower CFR. Our findings based on individual-level surveillance data emphasize the importance of early detection of elderly patients, particularly males, before symptoms progress to severe pneumonia.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021675v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021675v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

"High-throughput multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis prioritizes apolipoprotein B as key lipid risk factor for coronary artery disease","Background: Genetic variants can be used to prioritize risk factors as potential therapeutic targets via Mendelian randomization (MR). An agnostic statistical framework using Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) can disentangle the causal role of correlated risk factors with shared genetic predictors. Here, our objective is to identify lipoprotein measures as mediators between lipid-associated genetic variants and coronary artery disease (CAD) for the purpose of detecting therapeutic targets for CAD.

Methods: As risk factors we consider 30 lipoprotein measures and metabolites derived from a high-throughput metabolomics study including 24,925 participants. We fit multivariable MR models of genetic associations with CAD estimated in 453,595 participants (including 113,937 cases) regressed on genetic associations with the risk factors. MR-BMA assigns to each combination of risk factors a model score quantifying how well the genetic associations with CAD are explained. Risk factors are ranked by their marginal score and selected using false discovery rate (FDR) criteria. We perform sensitivity and replication analyses varying the dataset for genetic associations with CAD.

Results: In the main analysis, the top combination of risk factors ranked by the model score contains apolipoprotein B (ApoB) only. ApoB is also the highest ranked risk factor with respect to the marginal score (FDR< 0.005). Additionally, ApoB is selected in all replication analyses. No other measure of cholesterol or triglyceride is consistently selected otherwise. 

Conclusions: Our agnostic genetic investigation prioritizes ApoB across all datasets con- sidered, suggesting that ApoB, representing the total number of hepatic-derived lipoprotein particles, is the primary lipid determinant of CAD.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021691v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021691v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

"Effect of Respiratory Muscle Training on Dysphagia in Stroke Patients - A Retrospective Pilot Study","Background: Dysphagia is prevalent with cerebrovascular accidents and contributes to the burden of disease and mortality. Strengthening of the dysfunctional swallow muscles through respiratory muscle training (RMT) has proven effective in improving swallow effectiveness and safety. However, approaches to strengthen only the expiratory muscle groups (EMST) dominate the clinical study literature, with variable outcomes. This study investigated the effect of a simultaneous inspiratory and expiratory muscle strengthening strategy to improve swallowing function in stroke patients. 

Methods: Twenty post-stroke patients were randomly assigned to either intervention group (IG) or control group (CG). The intervention group was treated with three 5-minute sessions of resistive respiratory muscle training every day for 28 days, while the control group received no RMT. Respiratory and swallow outcomes were assessed pre- and post-intervention and included Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA), Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) with Penetration/Aspiration Scale (PAS), Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), patient visual analogue scale (VAS), and peak expiratory flow (PEF). 

Results: After 28 days, the intervention group demonstrated greater improvements (pVal < 0.05) in PEF (IG: 168.03% vs CG: 17.47%), VAS (IG: 103.85% vs CG: 27.54%), MASA (IG: 37.28% vs CG: 6.92%), PAS (IG: 69.84% vs CG: 12.12%), and FOIS (IG: 93.75% vs CG: 21.21%). 

Conclusion: Combined resistive inspiratory and expiratory muscle training is a feasible and effective method to improve signs and symptoms of dysphagia in stroke patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021303v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021303v1.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Transmission and epidemiological characteristics of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Pneumonia (NCP): preliminary evidence obtained in comparison with 2003-SARS","[Abstract] Objectives Latest epidemic information of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Pneumonia (NCP) was collected and a detailed statistical analysis was carried out to make comparison with 2003-SARS in order to provide scientific reference for the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV. Methods The information of NCP and 2003-SARS from websites of NHCPRC and the World Health Organization was collected, and then the transmission dynamics of the two kinds of infectious diseases were analyzed. The information of 853 confirmed NCP patients obtained from the website of health committees of 18 provinces. A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the NCP epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed NCP case data. Results The growth rate of new cases and deaths of NCP were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 853 confirmed NCP cases aged 1 months to 94 years and the average age was (45.05 17.22) years. The gender ratio (M: F) was 1.12: 1. Conclusions The fatality rate of NCP is lower than that of 2003-SARS and the cure rate is higher. The age of NCP patients is mainly concentrated in the 30-50 years old (60.61%). The harm of the first-generation NCP patients is higher than that of secondary cases.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019836v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019836v3.full.pdf","2020-02-11","Epidemiology

"Early evaluation of Wuhan City travel restrictions in response to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak","An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first reported in China in December 2019 and has spread to other countries. On January 23rd 2020 China shut down transit in and out of Wuhan city, a major transport hub and conurbation of 11 million inhabitants, to contain the outbreak. By combining epidemiological and human mobility data we find that the travel ban slowed the dispersal of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan to other cities in China by 2.91 days (95% CI: 2.54-3.29). This delay provided extra time to establish and reinforce other control measures that are essential to halt the epidemic.

"Correlates of better linear growth among children in sub-Saharan Africa: Cross sectional survey analysis of positive deviants in poor households","Objectives:  To examine the sociodemographic correlates associated with better linear growth among children under 5 years living in poor households 
Design: Cross-sectional
Setting: Ghana, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Mozambique
Participants: Singleton children aged 0 to 59 months, born to mothers aged 15 to 49 years. Information on children was obtained through face-to-face interviews with mothers.
Primary outcome measure:  Child height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ), categorised into HAZ=-2 standard deviations (SD) (better growth/not stunted) and HAZ=-2 SD (stunted/poor growth). 
Results: A unit change in maternal years of education was associated with increased odds of better growth among children living in poor households in DRC [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)= 1.03, 95% CI=1.01,1.07)], Ghana (aOR=1.06, 95% CI=1.01,1.11), Kenya (aOR=1.03, 95% CI= 1.01, 1.05) and Nigeria (aOR=1.08, 95%=1.06,1.10). Maternal antenatal attendance of at least four visits was associated positively with better child growth in DRC (aOR=1.32, 95% CI=1.05, 1.67) and Ghana (aOR=1.67, 95% CI=1.19, 2.33). The association did not reach statistical significance in the remaining three countries. In Ghana, Mozambique and DRC, breastfeeding was associated significantly with the likelihood of better linear growth when only socio-demographic correlates were included in the models, but disappeared after the inclusion of child level covariates. In Nigeria, maternal normal weight was associated with increased odds (aOR=1.24, 95% CI=1.08, 1.43) of better growth among children living in poor households, so was overweight (aOR=1.51, 95% CI= 1.24, 1.83). In all the countries except Ghana, child biological factors such as sex and age were associated with reduced odds of better linear growth.
Conclusions: The socio-demographic factors included in this analysis have the potential to promote linear growth of children under 5 years living in poor households. Interventions aimed at promoting linear growth among children living in poverty should target at enhancing these factors.

"Secondary Vulvodynia Patients Show Reduced Bacterial Diversity in Vestibular Microbiome","Introduction: Localized Provoked Vulvodynia (LPV) is a quite common form of sexual pain among young women. Primary LPV (e.g. pain from the first attempted intercourse) and secondary LPV (pain-free time period before the initiation of symptoms) have been suggested to develop via different pathomechanisms. As inflammation is one possible trigger in LPV, changes in vaginal and/or vulvar microbiome may be an initiator of the inflammatory process leading to peripheral neurosensitization and predisposing women to LPV. Aim: Aim of this pilot study was to find out, whether there are differences in vestibular microbiome between LPV patients and controls. Materials and Methods: Thirty women with LPV (8 with primary and 22 with secondary LPV) and 21 controls were prospectively recruited to the study from Kanta-Hame Central Hospital and Tampere University Hospital (TAUH).  Paired vestibular samples were collected in clinical outpatient setting and analyzed with 16s rRNA sequencing. Results: LPV patients had lower BMI, were younger and more often nulliparous than controls. Patients with secondary vulvodynia had reduced (p = 0.06) bacterial species diversity (alpha diversity) and more clustered (p= 0.05) vaginal microbiome community (beta diversity) compared to healthy controls. Differential abundance analysis identified 31 bacterial taxa that contributed to the difference in bacterial composition between secondary cases and controls (p < 0.05). Bacteria taxa that were increased among patients were Gardneralla vaginalis (p<0.0001), Peptoniphilus spp (p<0.0001), Prevotella amnii (p<0.0001) and Streptococcus spp (p=0.0001). Several bacterial species were more abundant among healthy controls reflecting reduced bacterial diversity among patients. Conclusion: In patients with secondary LPV changes in vulvar microbiome may contribute to pathogenesis of LPV and ultimately lead to targeted therapeutic options. These preliminary findings need to be confirmed in a larger study.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021014v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021014v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Obstetrics and Gynecology

Policy review using government websites and shortage analysis using mathematical modelling based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Peoples Republic of China.
 
Findings 
Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both the healthcare workers and the general population if the NCP outbreak only occurred in Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in both Hubei and Guangdong provinces, facemask supplies in the whole of China could last for 34 days if no alternative public health intervention was introduced. There would be a shortage of 480 million facemasks by mid-February 2020. If the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies could only last for 16 days and the shortage would considerably worsen, with a shortage of 11.5 billion facemasks by mid-February 2020.
 
Interpretation
In light of the novel coronavirus outbreak in China, insufficient medical resources (e.g., shortage of facemasks) can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. An effective public health intervention should also consider the adequacy and affordability of existing medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20020735v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20020735v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Public and Global Health

"Assessment of the Prevalence of Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients at Nakfa Hospital from 2014-2019, Eritrea","Background: Tuberculosis, an infectious disease, is one of the top 10 causes of death, and the leading cause from a single infectious agent M. tuberculosis. According to recent WHO estimate report, at least 3100 new TB cases occur every year in Eritrea. However, very little information is available in Eritrea related to area specific prevalence of tuberculosis and risk factors attributed to it. This 
is a retrospective study aimed to assess the prevalence of tuberculosis disease among patients attending at Nakfa Hospital, Eritrea.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on patients visiting Nakfa Hospital, 221km north of Asmara, Eritrea from April 2014 
to March 2019. Data was extracted from secondary data sources like patient admission records and laboratory registers at Nakfa 
Hospital. 
Results: A total of 1100 patients were examined for tuberculosis using acid fast staining test. The overall prevalence of smear 
positive pulmonary TB cases was 7.8% (86 cases out of 1100). Females (8.2%) were more prone to have a positive Tuberculosis 
smear than males (7.4%). According to severity of infection, 38(3.5%) of subjects were +1 positive, whereas 23(2.1%) and 24(2.2%) 
of patients were +2 and +3 positives respectively. The highest prevalence of pulmonary TB was observed in the adult age group of 
41-60 years (11%) and a comparatively higher number of cases was recorded in age group 21-40 years (8.3%). Adults aged between 
41 to 60 had a two times more likelihood to be infected with Tuberculosis than those aged below 20 years old. Moreover, 
pulmonary tuberculosis was highly prevalent among middle age (20-60) than any other age class in all study years (2014-2019). The 
pulmonary TB cases were highly predominant during the year 2014 which was 16.8% (19 of 113 subjects) whereas the almost a 
quarter of it (4.5%) was recorded in following year. Based on locality, the highest rate of infection was observed in Adobha (25%), a 
town at border of Sudan and Eritrea, in which patients who came from Adobha had 4 times more likelihood to be infected than 
those from Nakfa town.
Conclusion: This study showed Nakfa subzone has relatively increased prevalence of smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis than 
the average WHO estimate for the country. Therefore, appropriate policies and strategies for prevention, targeted detection of 
cases and treatment are required to reinforce Tuberculosis control programs.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021279v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021279v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Public and Global Health

"Laboratory diagnosis and monitoring the viral shedding of 2019-nCoV infections","Background:  The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by 2019-nCoV spread rapidly, and elucidation the diagnostic accuracy of different respiratory specimens is crucial for the control and treatment of this diseases.  
Methods:  Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. 
Finding:  Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected = 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected = 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral RNAs could be detected in all the lower respiratory tract of severe cases, but not the mild cases. CT scan of cases 02, 07 and 13 showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass opacity, while no viral RNAs were detected in first three or all the upper respiratory samples.    
Interpretation:  Sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases. CT scan could serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP.

"Simulating the infected population and spread trend of 2019-nCov under different policy by EIR model","Chinese government has taken strong measures in response to the epidemic of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Jan.23, 2020. The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. According to the spread characters of 2019-nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model. This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported official data, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021519v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021519v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Epidemiology

"Agreement between ranking metrics in network meta-analysis: an empirical study","Objective: 
To empirically explore the level of agreement of the treatment hierarchies from different ranking metrics in network meta-analysis (NMA) and to investigate how network characteristics influence the agreement.
Design: 
Empirical evaluation from re-analysis of network meta-analyses. 
Data: 
232 networks of four or more interventions from randomised controlled trials, published between 1999 and 2015.
Methods: 
We calculated treatment hierarchies from several ranking metrics: relative treatment effects, probability of producing the best value (pBV) and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). We estimated the level of agreement between the treatment hierarchies using different measures: Kendall's t and Spearman's <U+03C1> correlation; and the Yilmaz tAP and Average Overlap, to give more weight to the top of the rankings. Finally, we assessed how the amount of the information present in a network affects the agreement between treatment hierarchies, using the average variance, the relative range of variance, and the total sample size over the number of interventions of a network.
Results: 
Overall, the pairwise agreement was high for all treatment hierarchies obtained by the different ranking metrics. The highest agreement was observed between SUCRA and the relative treatment effect for both correlation and top-weighted measures whose medians were all equal to one. The agreement between rankings decreased for networks with less precise estimates and the hierarchies obtained from pBV appeared to be the most sensitive to large differences in the variance estimates. However, such large differences were rare.
Conclusions: 
Different ranking metrics address different treatment hierarchy problems, however they produced similar rankings in the published networks. Researchers reporting NMA results can use the ranking metric they prefer, unless there are imprecise estimates or large imbalances in the variance estimates. In this case treatment hierarchies based on both probabilistic and non-probabilistic ranking metrics should be presented.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021055v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021055v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Epidemiology

"Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Predicts Severe Illness Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the Early Stage","Background: Severe ill patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure. We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence.
Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve.
Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a c-index of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the NLR had superior standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of severe illness was 9.1% in age = 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients, and half of patients with age = 50 and NLR = 3.13 would develop severe illness. Based on the risk stratification of NLR with age, the study developed a 2019-nCoV pneumonia management process.
Conclusions: The NLR was the early identification of risk factors for 2019-nCoV severe illness. Patients with age = 50 and NLR = 3.13 facilitated severe illness, and they should rapidly access to intensive care unit if necessary.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021584v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021584v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Beyond R0: the importance of contact tracing when predicting epidemics","The basic reproductive number --- R0 --- is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health.  Nevertheless, estimating R0 for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over.  Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R0. Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of R0 and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections.  To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R0) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections.  Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R0 when predicting epidemic size.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021725v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021725v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Epidemiology

"Isolevuglandins promote autoimmunity and hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus","Hypertension, vascular inflammation and renal inflammation are characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem autoimmune disease that is complex and poorly understood. Oxidation products of arachidonic and other fatty acids, termed isolevuglandins (isoLG) lead to formation of post-translational protein modifications that are immunogenic. We demonstrate isoLG enrichment in dendritic cells (DCs), B cells, and plasma cells from juvenile female B6.SLE123 mice. In adult B6.SLE123 and NZBWF1 mice, isoLG adducts are enriched in plasma cells and splenic DCs compared to C57Bl/6 and NZW mice respectively. Treatment with the isoLG-scavenger 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) reduced blood pressure, improved renal function, and attenuated renal injury. Moreover, 2-HOBA reduced bone marrow plasma cells, total IgG levels, and anti-dsDNA antibody titers. We also demonstrate that mice with SLE generate specific IgG antibodies against isoLG adducted protein, confirming the immunogenicity of isoLG adducts. Finally, we found that isoLG adducted peptides are markedly enriched in monocytes from patients with SLE which was accompanied by an increase in superoxide production. These findings support a role of isoLG adducts in the genesis and maintenance of systemic autoimmunity and its associated hypertension in SLE. Scavenging of isoLGs promises to be a novel therapy for this disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021741v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021741v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Allergy and Immunology

"Metabolomic changes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes","Objective: Widespread metabolic changes are seen in neurodegenerative disease and could be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring. They may also reveal disease mechanisms that could be a target for therapy. In this study we looked for blood-based biomarkers in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. 

Methods: Plasma metabolomic profiles were measured from 134 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia n=30, non fluent variant primary progressive aphasia n=26, progressive supranuclear palsy n=45, corticobasal syndrome n=33) and 32 healthy controls.

Results: Forty-nine of 842 metabolites were significantly altered in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (after false-discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons). These were distributed across a wide range of metabolic pathways including amino acids, energy and carbohydrate, cofactor and vitamin, lipid and nucleotide pathways. The metabolomic profile supported classification between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and controls with high accuracy (88.1-96.6%) while classification accuracy was lower between the frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes (72.1-83.3%). One metabolic profile, comprising a range of different pathways, was consistently identified as a feature of each disease versus controls: the degree to which a patient expressed this metabolomic profile was associated with their subsequent survival (hazard ratio 0.74 [0.59-0.93], p=0.0018). 

Conclusions: The metabolic changes in FTLD are promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Further work is required to replicate these findings, examine longitudinal change, and test their utility in differentiating between FTLD syndromes that are pathologically distinct but phenotypically similar.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021758v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021758v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Neurology

"A Cohort Study: Evaluating Self-Efficacy in Adolescents Attending a Tailored Youth-Informed Breastfeeding Program","Adolescents (=19 years of age) have lower rates of breastfeeding (BF) compared to older mothers. BF self-efficacy (SE), defined as a mother's confidence in her ability to breastfeed her infant, has been identified as an important factor influencing BF outcomes. An innovative youth-informed BF program for young women was designed and implemented, which included staff training, a prenatal BF class and BF peer support. The objective of this cohort study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in improving young mother's BF SE.
Participants were pregnant adolescents recruited from a large urban non-profit social service outreach centre. The Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF) was administered to participants before and after participating in the BF program. BSES-SF scores were summed to determine a composite score and compared descriptively using mean score. Un-aggregated, item-by-item, comparison of pre- vs post-BF program scores were also compared to examine improvements in SE. A total of 20 adolescent mothers (mean age = 16.6) attended the BF pro-gram. An increase in the total BSES-SF score was observed based on descriptively comparing the mean pre vs post intervention. 
Prenatal education and peer support adapted to the needs of adolescent mothers was associated with increased BSES-SF. These results are promising given that clients attending programs at this agency have low-income, low educational attainment, variable family support, housing instability, and are at-risk for not breastfeeding. Future studies with larger cohort are required to further validate and establish generalizability, as well as to determine the effect on BF duration rates.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021808v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021808v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Obstetrics and Gynecology

"Ophthalmologic evidence against the interpersonal transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus through conjunctiva","Background: The emerging 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has pushed several countries into state of emergency all over the world. The possible transmission of 2019-nCoV by conjunctiva is controversial and has substantial public health implications.
Methods: A retrospective cohort study was initiated to investigate the possible transmission of 2019-nCoV through aerosol contact with conjunctiva. We enrolled 67 cases of confirmed or suspected cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) during 17-28 Jan 2020. Nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were collected for real time RT-PCR analysis to detect 2019-nCoV.
Results: 63 patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed NCP and the remaining four were suspected NCP. Conjunctival swab samples from one NCP patient yielded positive PCR results and two NCP patients yielded probable positive PCR results. None of the three patients had ocular symptoms. The only one NCP patient with conjunctivitis as the first symptom had negative conjunctival sac 2019-nCoV test. Conjunctival swab samples from the four suspected cases of NCIP were negative.
Conclusion: 2019-nCoV can be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients with NCP. Through clinical analysis, viral transmission via the conjunctival route was not supported by the data. Good clinical protection can effectively cut off the transmission path.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021956v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021956v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Ophthalmology

"Ultra-low DNA input into whole genome methylation assays and detection of oncogenic methylation & copy number variants in circulating tumour DNA","Background:
CpG methylation in cancer is ubiquitous and generally detected in tumour specimens using a variety of techniques at a resolution encompassing single CpG loci to genome wide. Analysis of samples with very low DNA inputs, such as formalin fixed (FFPE) biopsy specimens from clinical trials or circulating tumour DNA has been challenging and has only been typically at single CpG sites. Analysis of genome wide methylation in these specimens has been limited because of the relative expense of techniques need to carry this out. We present the results of low input experiments into the Illumina Infinium HD methylation assay on FFPE specimens and ctDNA samples. 
Methods:
For all experiments, the Infinium HD assay for Methylation was used. In total, forty-eight FFPE specimens were used at varying concentrations (lowest input 50ng), eighteen blood derived specimens (lowest input 10ng) and six matched ctDNA input (lowest input 10ng) / fresh tumour specimens (lowest input 250ng) were processed. Downstream analysis was performed in R/Bioconductor for QC metrics and differential methylation analysis as well as copy number calls. 
Results:
Correlation coefficients for CpG methylation at the probe level averaged R2=0.99 for blood derived samples and R2>0.96 for the FFPE samples. When matched ctDNA/fresh tumour samples were compared R2>0.91. Results of differential methylation analysis did not vary significantly by DNA input in either the blood or FFPE groups. There were differences seen in the ctDNA group as compared to their paired tumour sample, possibly because of enrichment for tumour material without contaminating normal. Copy number variants observed in the tumour were generally also seen in the paired ctDNA sample.
Conclusions: The Illumina Infinium HD methylation assay can robustly detect methylation across a range of sample types, including ctDNA, down to a input of 10ng. It can also reliably detect oncogenic methylation changes and copy number variants in ctDNA.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021964v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021964v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Characteristics of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in peripheral blood of 123 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)","Background: To explore the cellular immunity and cytokines status of NCP patients and to predict the correlation between the cellular immunity levels, cytokines and the severity of patients.
Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups were analyzed.
Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6 and IL-10.
Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in severe patients. T cell subsets and cytokines can be used as one of the basis for predicting the transition from mild to severe. Large number of samples are still needed to confirm the ""warning value"" of CD4 + T, CD8 + T IL-6 and IL-10.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021832v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021832v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Hematology

"Distribution of the 2019-nCoV Epidemic and Correlation with Population Emigration from Wuhan, China","BACKGROUNDS:
The ongoing new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia outbreak is spreading in China and has not reached its peak. Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. 
METHODS:
The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number.
FINDINGS:
The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number.
INTERPRETATION:
Population emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021824v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021824v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"The psychological distress of parents is associated with reduced linear growth of children: evidence from a nationwide population survey","Background. Stunting, an indicator of restricted linear growth, has become a primary measure of childhood undernutrition due to its persistent high prevalence globally, and importance for health and development. Although the etiology is recognized to be complex, most analyses have focused on biomedical determinants, with limited attention to social factors affecting care and nurturing in the home. 
Objectives. To identify the association between parental distress and linear growth and stunting and to examine z score loss due to any parental distress and socioeconomic, behavioral, and physiologic risk factors for linear growth 
Design. Cross-sectional study   
Participants. 54,261 households from the Indonesia National Health Survey 2013. 
Main outcome measures. Multivariate linear, logistic, and multilevel multinomial logistic regression, using survey weights, were used to assess the relationship between parental distress, as assessed by the WHO Self Reporting Questionnaire, with height-for-age z score (HAZ), stunting, and behavioral risk factors for stunting. 
Results. Maternal, paternal and parental distress (i.e. both maternal and paternal distress) were associated with reduced linear growth of the children by 0.091, 0.13 and 0.21 z-scores, respectively. Maternal and paternal distress increased the risk of mild stunting (HAZ < -1) by 38% and 39%, and the risk of moderate stunting (HAZ < -2) by 41% and 23%, respectively. Parental stress increased the risk of moderate and severe stunting by 67% and 41%.  Any parental distress accounted for 5.6% of the modeled overall loss of HAZ-score due to interactions with socioeconomic status (low maternal occupational status, low wealth, low maternal occupation) and behavioral (poor garbage sanitation) factors, rendering it amongst the more influential factors on linear growth. The modeled overall loss of HAZ-score incorporating any parental distress was associated with socioeconomic factors (26.1%) including, in descending order, low maternal occupational status, low wealth, low maternal education, low paternal occupational status, rural residence; behavioral factors (15.3%) including open garbage disposal, unimproved water disposal, paternal smoking, not using iodized salt; physiological factors (13.5%) including low maternal height, female child, paternal height, maternal mid-upper arm circumference.  
Conclusions. These findings highlight the complex etiology of stunting and suggest nutritional and other biomedical interventions are insufficient, and that promotion of mental and behavioral health programs for parents are essential to achieve child growth and development, and would likely foster taller, healthier, smarter, and thriving populations.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022103v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022103v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12",NA,"Susiloretni","/highwire/citation/72043/bibtext",54,"170220-54","17/02/2020","72043"

"Predicting loss of independence and mortality in frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes","Objective
To test the hypothesis that in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, behavioural impairment predicts loss of functional independence and motor clinical features predict mortality, irrespective of syndrome subtype. 

Method
We used a transdiagnostic approach to survival in an epidemiological cohort, testing the association between clinical features, independence and survival in patients with clinical diagnoses of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (n=64), non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (n=36), semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (n=25), progressive supranuclear palsy (n=101) and corticobasal syndrome (n=68). A principal components analysis identified six dimensions of clinical features. Using Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression we identified the association between each of these dimensions and functionally independent survival (time from clinical assessment to care home admission), and absolute survival (time to death). Analyses adjusted for the covariates of age, gender and diagnostic group. Secondary analysis excluded specific diagnostic groups.

Results
Behavioural disturbance, including impulsivity and apathy, was associated with reduced functionally independent survival (OR 2.46, p<0.001), even if patients with bvFTD were removed from the analysis. Motor impairments were associated with reduced absolute survival, even if patients with PSP and CBS were removed from the analysis.

Conclusion
Our results may help individualised prognostication and planning of disease-modifying trials and support a transdiagnostic approach to symptomatic treatment trials in patients with clinical syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022061v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022061v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Neurology

"Statistical Inference for Coronavirus Infected Patients in Wuhan","Importance: The new coronavirus outbreak has seriously affected the quality of life in China. Wuhan is the disaster area, where the number of cases has increased rapidly. However, the current measures of infected patients in Wuhan are still underestimated.
Objective: To estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan from several sampled data. The correct estimated infected patients can be helpful for the government to arrange the needed beds in hospital wards to meet the actual needs.
Design: We proposed to use the sampling survey to estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan. The sampling survey is a kind of non-comprehensive survey. It selected some units from all the survey objects to carry out the survey and made the estimation and inference to all the survey objects. Sampling surveys can obtain information that reflects the overall situation, although it is not a comprehensive survey.  
Setting: We estimated the overall infection rate in Wenzhou city, which has a better data collection system. Simultaneously, another different samples of Wuhan tourists to Singapore will be used to validate the infection rate in Wenzhou city. Combined these two samples, we give the estimation of the number of infected patients in Wuhan and other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province. 
Participants: The number of people who returned from Wuhan to Wenzhou was selected from the daily notification of the pneumonia epidemic caused by a new coronavirus infection in the city.  
Exposures for observational studies: The daily rate of the pneumonia epidemic caused by the new coronavirus infection in Wenzhou City. The numerator is the number of people diagnosed and whether each person diagnosed had a history of living in Wuhan. The denominator is the total number of people returning to Wenzhou from Wuhan. Based on this rate, it is reasonable to predict the number of the infected patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021774v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021774v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Caution on Kidney Dysfunctions of 2019-nCoV Patients","Until 24:00 of February 7th 2020, 31774 laboratory-confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection have been reported, including 6101 severe cases in critical conditions and 722 deaths. The critical and urgent need at this moment is to find an effective treatment strategy with available means to prevent these thousands of severe inpatients from worsening and dying. It has been recently known that the 2019-nCoV shares a common cellular mechanism with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Thus, we surveyed a previous retrospective case study on SARS which showed that acute renal impairment was uncommon in SARS but carried a formidably high mortality (91.7%, 33 of 36 cases). Here we report an ongoing case study on kidney functions in 59 patients infected by 2019-nCoV (including 28 diagnosed as severe cases and 3 deaths). 63% (32/51) of the patients exhibited proteinuria, indicative of renal impairment. 19% (11/59) and 27% (16/59) of the patients had an elevated level of plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen respectively. The computerized tomography (CT) scan showed radiographic abnormalities of the kidneys in 100% (27/27) of the patients. Together, these multiple lines of evidence point to the idea that renal impairment is common in 2019-nCov patients, which may be one of the major causes of the illness by the virus infection and also may contribute to multi-organ failure and death eventually. Therefore, we strongly suggest exercising a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of 2019-nCoV patients and, very importantly, that applying potential interventions including continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for protecting kidney functions as early as possible, particular for those with plasma creatinine rising, is key to preventing fatality.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021212v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021212v1.full.pdf","2020-02-12","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Statistics based predictions of coronavirus 2019-nCoV spreading in mainland China","Background.  The epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented.
      
Objective. Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time.

Methods. In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989.  

Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted.
 
Conclusions. Simple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV in mainland China. The further research should focus on updating the predictions with the use of fresh data and using more complicated mathematical models.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021931v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021931v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Epidemiology

"Lockdown may partially halt the spread of 2019 novel coronavirus in Hubei province, China","We present a timely evaluation of the impact of lockdown on the 2019-nCov epidemic in Hubei province, China. The implementation appears to be effective in reducing about 60% of new infections and deaths, and its effect also appears to be sustainable even after its removal. Delaying its implementation reduces its effectiveness. However, the direct economic cost of such a lockdown remains to be seen and whether the model is replicable in other Chinese regions remains a matter of further investigation.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022236v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022236v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Data-Based Analysis, Modelling and Forecasting of the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","Since the first suspected case of novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) infected pneumonia (NCIP) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. 
Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data (WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC and DXY) for Hubei from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters, i.e. the basic reproduction number (R0) and the infection, recovery and mortality rates, along with their 90% confidence intervals. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, we have repeated the calculations under a scenario that considers five times the number of confirmed infected cases and eight times the number of recovered. Our computations and analysis were based on a mean field Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be 2.5, while the one computed by the official counts of the confirmed cases from the 11th of January until the 18th of January was found to be 4.6. Furthermore, on the estimated parameters from both scenarios, we provide tentative three-week forecasts of the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter.
Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the cumulative number of infected will surpass 68,000 (as a lower bound) and could reach 140,000 (with an upper bound of 290,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of current data and estimations on the official count of infected people in the population, the death toll might exceed 7,000 by February 29; however, our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the mortality rate to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but also a high underestimation of the number of infected and recovered people in the population, which will hopefully lower the death toll.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCoV, in the nasal tissue","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells. We hope this study could be informative for virus-prevention strategy development, especially the treatment of nasal mucus.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022228v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022228v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"ACE2 Expression in Kidney and Testis May Cause Kidney and Testis Damage After 2019-nCoV Infection","In December 2019 and January 2020, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) - infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, and has already posed a serious threat to public health. ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients' fertility.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022418v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022418v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Urology

"Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2","Objectives: To determine if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. 
Design: Simulation study
Setting: Countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions
Participants: Infected air travellers
Interventions: Syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset. 
Main outcome measures: The achievable delay until a major local outbreak is likely to occur
Results: We evaluated traveller sensitisation effectiveness in reducing the number of secondary cases of 30, 50 and 70%, and assumed either 1, 10, or 100 infected travellers per week. Early in the outbreak when only few infected travellers arrive, traveller sensitisation can delay a major outbreak in a previously unaffected region. For 50% sensitisation effectiveness, and assuming 1 infected traveller per week, we find that in 75% of simulations the outbreak is delayed by at least 11 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 7 days). The possible delay decreases rapidly for more travellers, lower effectiveness of sensitisation, higher R0 or lower heterogeneity thereof. Syndromic traveller screening at departure and/or arrival can further enhance outbreak delays. In combination with sensitisation, syndromic screening can delay an outbreak substantially longer. In 75% of simulations we find an outbreak delay of at least 111 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 23 days) for 1 infected traveller per week and at least 9 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 4 days) for 10 infected travellers per week. 

Conclusion: Air-traveller targeted interventions, particularly in combination, can delay local SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in the magnitude of a few weeks to potentially even months if the number of infected travellers remains low.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022426v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022426v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Epidemiology

"Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan City: China, 2019-2020","Background: 
Since the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, 2019-nCoV has rapidly spread across China as well as caused multiple introductions in 25 countries as of February, 2020. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of emerging disease. The present study aimed to estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-nCov in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics.
Methods: 
We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For estimation, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed nCov cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were used.
Results: 
We found that our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 is calculated to be as high as 7.05 (95%CrI: 6.11-8.18) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 has declined R to 3.24 (95%CrI: 3.16-3.32), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 983006 (95%CrI: 759475-1296258) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 9.8% (95%CrI: 7.6-13.0%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.07% (95% CrI: 0.05%-0.09%) and 0.23% (95%CrI: 0.17-0.30%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR at 4.06%
Conclusions: 
We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-nCov in Wuhan, China, 2019-2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Clinical diagnosis of 8274 samples with 2019-novel coronavirus in Wuhan","Background 
2019-Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreaks create challenges for hospital laboratories because thousands of samples must be evaluated each day. Sample types, interpretation methods, and corresponding laboratory standards must be established. The possibility of other infections should be assessed to provide a basis for clinical classification, isolation, and treatment. Accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated the testing methods for 2019-nCoV and co-infections.
Methods 
We used a fluorescence-based quantitative PCR kit urgently distributed by the Chinese CDC to detect 8274 close contacts in the Wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-nCoV genome. We also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens; 316 subjects were also tested for 2019-nCoV.
Findings 
Among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-nCoV infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed negative results in the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test (non-019-nCoV); and 252 cases (3.0%) because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. Sixteen patients who originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 14 patients (87.5%) were finally defined as 2019-nCoV-positive, and 2 (12.5%) were finally defined as negative. The positive rates of nCoV-NP and nCovORF1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. nCoV-NP-positive only and nCovORF1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. In the 316 patients with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-nCov and 6/104 had co-infection with coronavirus (3/104), influenza A virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza A H3N2 (1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza A virus (11/202), influenza A H3N2 (11/202), rhinovirus (10/202), respiratory syncytial virus (7/202), influenza B virus (6/202), metapneumovirus (4/202), and coronavirus (2/202).
Interpretation: Clinical testing methods for 2019-nCoV require improvement. Importantly, 5.8% of 2019-nCoV infected and 18.4% of non-2019-nCoV-infected patients had other pathogen infections. It is important to treat combined infections and perform rapid screening to avoid cross-contamination of patients. A test that quickly and simultaneously screens as many pathogens as possible is needed.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022327v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022327v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Epidemic size of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in the Epicenter Wuhan: using data of five-countries' evacuation action","Background: Since late December 2019, novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Meanwhile, NCP rapidly spread from China to other countries, and several countries' government rush to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. We analyzed the infection rate of the evacuees and extrapolated the results in Wuhan's NCP incidence estimation.
Methods: We collected the total number and confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection in the evacuation of Korea, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and France and estimated the infection rate of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) among people who were evacuated from Wuhan with a meta-analysis. NCP incidence of Wuhan was indirectly estimated based on data of evacuation. 
Results: From Jan 29 to Feb 2, 2020, 1916 people have been evacuated from Wuhan, among them 17 have been confirmed 2019-nCov infected. The infection rate is estimated to be 1.1% (95% CI 0.4%-3.1%) using one group meta-analysis method with random effect model. We then estimated that almost 110,000 (95% CI: 40,000-310,000) people were infected with 2019-nCov in Wuhan around Feb 2, 2020, assuming the infection risk of evacuees is close to Chinese citizens in Wuhan.
Conclusions: At the beginning of the outbreak, incidence of NCP may be vastly underestimated. Our result emphasizes that 2019-nCov has proposed a huge public health threats in Wuhan. We need to respond more rapidly, take large-scale public health interventions and draconian measures to limiting population mobility and control the epidemic.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022285v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022285v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Emergence of Resistance to Fluoroquinolones and Third-Generation Cephalosporins in Salmonella Typhi in Lahore, Pakistan","Background: Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Salmonella Typhi has been reported in Sindh province of Pakistan since 2016. The potential for further spread is of serious concern as remaining treatment options are severely limited. We report the phenotypic and genotypic characterisation of 27 XDR S. Typhi isolated from patients attending Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Methods: Isolates were identified by biochemical profiling; antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by a modified Kirby-Bauer method. These findings were confirmed using Illumina whole genome nucleotide sequence data. All sequences were compared to the outbreak strain from southern Pakistan and typed using the S. Typhi genotyping scheme. Findings: Twenty-seven XDR S. Typhi isolates were identified from patients at Jinnah Hospital in Lahore between January and April 2019. All isolates were confirmed by sequence analysis to harbour an IncY plasmid and the CTX-M-15 ceftriaxone resistance determinant. All isolates were of the same genotypic background as the outbreak strain from Sindh province. Summary: We report the first emergence of XDR S. Typhi in Punjab province of Pakistan confirmed by whole genome sequencing.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20020578v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20020578v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Bilateral Sequential Theta Burst Stimulation for Multiple-Therapy-Resistant Depression: a naturalistic observation study","Depression is a significant health issue with treatment resistance reported in about one third of patients. Treatment
resistance results in significant disability, impaired quality of life, and increased healthcare costs. Repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a treatment option for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with an
average response rate of around 30%. Theta-burst is a novel rTMS paradigm that has shown promise as a treatment
for TRD in some preliminary studies. In a naturalistic design, we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of bilateral
sequential (right then left) prefrontal theta-burst rTMS (bsTBS) in 50 patients with TRD (600 pulses/session, 20
sessions, 100% of resting motor threshold (two patients treated at 80% due to intolerance of 100%), F4/F3 of 10-20-20
EEG localization). Data was collected over 36 months from a specialized academic TMS clinic. Patients had multipletreatment
resistance with at least two failed trials of different antidepressants with 20% also having failed
electroconvulsive therapy and 66% having received professional therapy. We found a 28% remission rate (HAMD-17
score of = 7) and a 52% response rate (= 50% reduction in HAMD-17) with a 42% reduction in average HAMD-17
score. The treatment was well tolerated, with muscle contractions, mild pain or discomfort, headache, scalp irritation,
and changes to vitals being captured as occasional side effects with two instances of syncope (0.22% of treatments).

"Effect of smoking cessation on CT imaging in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A systematic review","Background: Smoking cessation is the only intervention known to affect disease progression in patients with COPD as measured by the rate of change in forced expiratory volume/1s (FEV1) over time. The need for new drugs to modify the progression of COPD is well recognised. We hypothesised that changes on CT in relation to smoking cessation may relate to changes in response to disease-modifying drugs, and therefore as a novel quantitative biomarker of drug efficacy.  CT biomarkers of emphysema and airway wall thickness are increasingly used in research, but there has not been a systematic appraisal of the evidence to assess how these biomarkers evolve with a change in smoking exposure in COPD patients.

Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)), and Web of Science to 10th September 2019 . We included longitudinal studies of smoking COPD patients who had CT scans before and after smoking cessation. Two review authors (DC, SA) independently screened studies, extracted outcome data and assessed the risk of bias, with a third reviewer (JRH) arbitrating conflicts.

Results: Four studies were included in the final analysis. Three studies measured CT markers of lung density, which all, perhaps counter-intuitively, showed a significant decrease with smoking cessation. One study measured CT markers of airway wall thickness, which also significantly decreased with smoking cessation.
 
Authors' conclusions: Smoking cessation in COPD patients causes a fall in lung density, but the magnitude of the effect has not been rigorously assessed. One study has reported a decrease in airway wall thickness with smoking cessation. The number of studies is small, with some risk of bias.  This question remains important for COPD researchers and requires further studies, in particular to assess whether changes with smoking cessation may model changes in response to novel pharmaceutical agents, and how to handle change in smoking status in relation to longitudinal observational imaging studies in COPD.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022129v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022129v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Respiratory Medicine

"Alzheimer's disease susceptibility gene apolipoprotein e (APOE) and blood biomarkers in UK Biobank (N=395,769).","Background and objective: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition where the underlying aetiology is still unclear. Investigating the potential influence of apolipoprotein (APOE), a major genetic risk factor, on common blood biomarkers could provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms of AD and dementia risk. Our objective was to conduct the largest (to date) single-protocol investigation of blood biomarkers in the context of APOE genotype, in UK Biobank.
Methods: After quality control and exclusions, data on 395,769 participants of White European ancestry were available for analysis. Linear regressions were used to test potential associations between APOE genotypes and biomarkers.
Results: Several biomarkers significantly associated with APOE e4 risk and e2 protective genotypes (vs. neutral e3/e3). Most associations supported previous data: for example, e4 genotype was associated with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) (standardized beta [b] = 0.150 standard deviations [SDs] per allele, p<0.001) and e2 with lower LDL (b = -0.456 SDs, p<0.001). There were however instances of associations found in unexpected directions: e.g. e4 and increased insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) (standardized beta = 0.017, p<0.001) where lower levels have been previously suggested as an AD risk factor. 
Conclusions: These findings highlight biomarker differences in non-demented people at genetic risk for dementia. The evidence here in supports previous hypotheses of involvement from cardiometabolic and neuroinflammatory pathways.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021998v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021998v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"One year cross-sectional study in adult and neonatal intensive care units reveals the bacterial and antimicrobial resistance genes profiles in patients and hospital surfaces","Several studies have shown the ubiquitous presence of bacteria in the hospital environmental surfaces, staff, and patients. Frequently, these bacteria are related to HAI (healthcare-associated infections) and carry antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These HAI-related bacteria contributes to a major public health issue by increasing patient morbidity and mortality during or after hospital stay. Bacterial high-throughput amplicon gene sequencing along with AMR genes identification and whole genome sequencing (WGS) are new biotechnological tools that allow multiple-sample screening for a diversity of bacteria. In this paper, we used these methods to perform an one-year cross sectional profiling of bacteria and AMR genes in adult and neonatal intensive care units (ICU and NICU) in a Brazilian public hospital. Our results showed high abundances of HAI-related bacteria as S. epidermidis, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii complex, E. coli, E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa in patients and hospital surfaces. Most abundant AMR genes detected throughout ICU and NICU were mecA, blaCTX-M-1 group, blaSHV-like and blaKPC-like. We found that NICU environment and patients were more widely contaminated with pathogenic bacteria than ICU. Patient samples, despite the higher bacterial load, have lower bacterial diversity than environmental samples in both units. Finally, we also identified contamination hotspots in the hospital environment showing constant frequencies of bacterial and AMR contamination throughout the year. WGS sequencing, 16S rRNA oligotypes and AMR identification allowed a high- resolution data analysis for bacterial characterization and its distributions along the hospital microbiome profile.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022145v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022145v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Nasal high-frequency percussive ventilation versus nasal continuous positive airway pressure in term and preterm neonates exhibiting respiratory distress: a randomized controlled trial (TONIPEP; NCT 02030691)","Objective. To determine whether the use of nasal, high-frequency percussive ventilation (nHFPV) to manage neonatal respiratory distress decreases the regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) below that afforded by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP).
Design. Monocentric, prospective, randomized, monocentric, open-label, non-inferiority crossover trial.
Patients. Newborns of gestational age (GA) = 33 weeks exhibiting persistent respiratory distress after 10 min of life (Silverman score = 4). 
Intervention. nHFPV and nCPAP, in succession and in random order. 
Main outcome measure. Mean rScO2, as revealed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) performed over the last 5 min of each ventilation mode. To show that nHFPV was not inferior to nCPAP, our a priori calculations required that the lower boundary of the bilateral 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the mean rScO2 values of each ventilation mode should exceed -5. 
Results. Forty-nine newborns were randomized and 46 were analyzed. The mean ( standard deviation [SD]) GA and birth weight were 36.4  1.9 weeks and 2,718  497 g. The diagnosis was transient tachypnea in 65% of cases and respiratory distress syndrome in 35%. The mean rScO2 difference during the last 5 min of each ventilation mode (nHFPV minus nCPAP) was -0.7  5.4% (95% CI - 2.25; 0.95). Neither a period effect nor a period-treatment interaction was evident. The mean transcutaneous carbon dioxide values (n = 26) for nCPAP and nHFPV were 7.1  4.8 and 7.9  5.1 kPa, respectively. No harmful or unintentional effect was observed.
Conclusion. In our study on newborns of GA = 33 weeks treated for respiratory distress, cerebral oxygenation via nHFPV was not inferior to nCPAP.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022178v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022178v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Pediatrics

"Differential response to cytotoxic therapy explains treatment dynamics of AML patients: insights from a mathematical modelling approach","Disease response and durability of remission are very heterogeneous in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. There is increasing evidence that the individual risk of early relapse can be predicted based on the initial treatment response. However, it is unclear how such a correlation is linked to functional aspects of AML progression and treatment. We suggest a mathematical model in which leukaemia-initiating cells and normal/healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells reversibly change between an active state characterized by proliferation and chemosensitivity and a quiescent state, in which the cells do not divide, but are also insensitive to chemotherapy. Applying this model to 275 molecular time courses of NPM1-mutated patients, we conclude that the differential chemosensitivity of the leukaemia-initiating cells together with the cells' intrinsic proliferative capacity is sufficient to reproduce both, early relapse as well as long-lasting remission. We can, furthermore, show that the model parameters associated with individual chemosensitivity and proliferative advantage of the leukemic cells are closely linked to the patients' time to relapse. They can, therefore, be used as a measure of the aggressiveness of the disease. Early assessment of these measures and incorporation into risk stratification schemes will improve risk assessment and individual treatment in AML.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021915v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021915v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Hematology

"ApoE e2 and aging-related outcomes in 379,000 UK Biobank participants","The Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele is associated with reduced longevity and increased Coronary Heart disease (CHD) and Alzheimer's disease, with e4e4 having markedly larger effect sizes than e3e4. The e2 longevity promoting variant is less studied. We conducted a phenome-wide association study of ApoE e2e3 and e2e2 with aging phenotypes, to assess their  potential as targets for anti-aging interventions. Data were from 379,000 UK Biobank participants, aged 40 to 70 years. e2e3 (n=46,535) had mostly lower lipid-related biomarker levels including reduced total and LDL-cholesterol, and lower risks of CHD (Odds Ratio = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.90) and hypertension (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92 to 0.97) versus e3e3. However, lipid changes in e2e2 (n=2,398) were more extreme, including a marked increase in tryglyceride levels (0.41 Standard Deviations, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.45), with no associated changes in CHD risks. There were no associations with biomarkers of kidney function. The effects of both e2e2 and e2e3 were minimal on falls, muscle mass, grip strength or frailty. In conclusion, e2e3 has protective effects on some health outcomes, but the effects of  e2e2 are not similar, complicating the potential usefulness of e2 as a target for anti-aging intervention.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022459v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022459v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Digital quantification of chronic gastric wall inflammation in asymptomatic bariatric patients after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy","Aim: to evaluate validity of digital quantification when compared with human fast-scoring in routine classification of chronic gastric wall inflammation. 
Method: 87 bariatric gastric samples coming from asymptomatic severe obese patients were examined and classified as normal, with unspecified chronic gastritis and lymphocytic gastritis using a fast-scoring, visual analogue scale method. Results were compared with digital diagnostic data (manual segmentation, supervised learning analysis based on intraepithelial lymphocytes count criteria). Discordant results were re-evaluated by the human pathologist by direct count (ground truth). Helicobacter Pylori diagnostic was performed in all cases (Giemsa).
Results: Digital analysis classified chronic inflammation as lymphocytic gastritis in 45 cases (mean 53 lymphocytes / 100 epithelial gastric cells SD 18). 30 cases were labeled as unspecific chronic gastritis (mean 25/100 SD 2.8) (p<0.0001). Human fast-scoring classified 43 cases as lymphocytic gastritis and 20 as unspecific gastritis. Helicobacter Pylori was detected in 49% of lymphocytic gastritis cases and in 7% of chronic gastritis. 47 diagnostics were concordant (54%). In 36%, digital score was better than human fast-scoring. In 7%, digital results were false negative (all cases generated by technical artifacts). Overall, digital quantification had 89% accuracy and 96% precision when compared with ground truth.          
Conclusion: In our study, digital image analysis produced a fast and reproducible classification of chronic gastric inflammation with good precision and accuracy. Technical errors generated 6 cases of false negative results. Several other limitations of the study (use of only bariatric gastric fundus tissue, low number of cases, manual supervised learning segmentation) ask for an increased number of cases evaluation before validation and clinical use.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022160v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022160v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Pathology

"Toward point-of-care diagnostics of Candida auris","Candida auris is a multidrug-resistant yeast that presents global health threat for the hospitalized patients. Early diagnostic of C. auris is crucial in control, prevention, and treatment. Candida auris is difficult to identify with standard laboratory methods and often can be misidentified leading to inappropriate management. A newly-devised real-time PCR assay played an important role in the ongoing investigation of the C. auris outbreak in New York metropolitan area. The assay can rapidly detect C. auris DNA in surveillance and clinical samples with high sensitivity and specificity, and also useful for confirmation of C. auris cultures. Despite its positive impact, the real-time PCR assay is difficult to deploy at frontline laboratories due to high-complexity set-up and operation. Using a low-cost handheld real-time PCR device, we show that the C. auris can potentially be identified in a low-complexity assay without the need for high-cost equipment. An implementation of low-cost real-time PCR device in hospitals and healthcare facilities is likely to accelerate the diagnosis of C. auris and for control of the global epidemic.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021683v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021683v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Epidemiology

"The Male Fertility Gene Atlas - A web tool for collecting and integrating data about epi-/genetic causes of male infertility","Interconnecting results of previous OMICs studies is of major importance for identifying novel underlying causes of male infertility. To date, information can be accessed mainly through literature search engines and raw data repositories. However, both have limited capacity in identifying relevant publications based on aggregated research results e.g. genes mentioned in images and supplements. To address this gap, we present the Male Fertility Gene Atlas (MFGA), a web tool that enables standardised representation and search of aggregated result data of scientific publications. An advanced search function is provided for querying research results based on study conditions/phenotypes, meta information and genes returning the exact tables and figures from the publications fitting the search request as well as a list of most frequently investigated genes. As basic prerequisite, a flexible data model that can accommodate and structure a very broad range of meta information, data tables and images was designed and implemented for the system. The first version of the system is published at the URL https://mfga.uni-muenster.de and contains a set of 46 representative publications. Currently, study data for 28 different tissue types, 32 different cell types and 20 conditions is available. Also, ~5,000 distinct genes have been found to be mentioned in at least ten of the publications. As a result, the MFGA is a valuable addition to available tools for research on the epi-/genetics of male infertility. The MFGA enables a more targeted search and interpretation of OMICs data on male infertility and germ cells in the context of relevant publications. Moreover, its capacity for aggregation allows for meta-analyses and data mining with the potential to reveal novel insights into male infertility based on available data.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021790v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021790v1.full.pdf","2020-02-13","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Long-Term Persistence of IgG Antibodies in SARS-CoV Infected Healthcare Workers","BACKGROUND:
The ongoing worldwide outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is markedly similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus-specific IgG play important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS-like coronavirus. 
METHODS:
A long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, as a diagnostic antigen.
RESULTS:
Anti SARS-CoV IgG was found to persist for up to 12 years. IgG titers typically peaked in 2004, declining rapidly from 2004-2006, and then continued to decline at a slower rate. IgG titers in SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers remained at a significantly high level until 2015. Patients treated with corticosteroids at the time of infection were found to have lower IgG titers than those without.
CONCLUSIONS:
IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can persist for at least 12 years. The presence of SARS-CoV IgG might provide protection against SARS-CoV and other betacoronavirus. This study provides valuable information regarding humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV and the 2019-nCoV.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021386v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021386v1.full.pdf","2020-02-14","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Erosion of representativeness in a cohort study","Background: The National Child and Development Study (1958 British Birth Cohort) follows the lives of over 17 000 people born in a single week in England, Scotland, and Wales. After initial recruitment, there have been nine sweeps to gather subsequent life-course data and a Biomedical Sweep (between Sweeps 6 and 7) that has been used in genetic studies. Due to its non-selective recruitment, the survey is frequently used as a representative proxy for the British population in demographic, epidemiological, and medical studies. We examine the effect of attrition on representativeness of female fertility and education length.

Methods: We compare numbers and timings of fertility-related events of female cohort members with national estimates. Spline approximation was used to link records with different aggregation intervals. Participants who were present in the Biomedical  Sweep were compared to those who were not. 

Results: We established that both timings and counts of maternities and terminations in the cohort diverge from the patterns of their contemporaries. For women who participated in the Biomedical Sweep,  we noted positive correlations of study continuation with years spent in full time education, and with age at first birth. We determined that women who did not participate in the Biomedical Sweep reported different fertility patterns from those who did. 

Conclusions: For female fertility, the 1958 Birth Cohort is an imperfect proxy for the British population, making the description ""broadly representative"" potentially misleading. Worsening bias due to attrition and misreporting can be identified and quantified through comparisons with national vital statistics.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022012v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022012v1.full.pdf","2020-02-14","Epidemiology

"Evaluating quality improvement at scale: development of a reporting methodology for board-level insights in a UK mental health Trust","Background:
The question of whether quality improvement (QI) in healthcare actually improves quality requires situational awareness over a diverse range of QI projects. An organisational-level overview remains largely elusive in recent literature that looks at QI at scale. On the other hand, where organisational-level estimates were offered, the extent they could be attributed to QI has been unclear. Evaluating QI at scale entails a reporting methodology that is slightly different from prevailing guidance on research evaluation of specific projects. This is essential for generating insights for organisational-level decision making to optimise return on investment from QI.

Method: 
A researcher-in-residence worked with a resident QI team to develop and conduct a retrospective evaluation of QI projects in a large healthcare organisation in the UK that specialises in mental health. Using a survey, we enumerated project outcomes and explored costs and benefits, as well as contextual, input and process factors that might be associated with whether QI projects led to a change in routine practice.

Findings:
Out of 52 QI projects, 10 led to a change in routine practice. Across a diverse range of projects, time invested by staff is an opportunity cost that could serve as a common denominator for return on investment. Retrospective data accrual proved problematic for measuring benefits. Odds ratios from logistic regressions show that process factors had more apparent impact on project outcomes than contextual and input factors. Of note, if QI projects had documentation for Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, the odds of effecting a change in routine practice were much higher.

Conclusions:
Prospective monitoring is necessary for ensuring systematic data accrual. Data accrual on costs and benefits of QI projects requires iterative development and learning. The onus of developing structured reports should fall on a resident QI unit. This will enable consistent measurement and coherent iterations. Developing a reporting methodology for routine organisational-level monitoring can be an asset for improving practice, one that is pivotal for a learning healthcare system.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022475v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022475v1.full.pdf","2020-02-14","Health Systems and Quality Improvement

"A spatial model of CoVID-19 transmission in England and Wales: early spread and peak timing","Background:
An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named CoVID-19, was first reported in China on 31 December 2019. As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England.  

Methods:
We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. 

Results: 
We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established.  Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. 

Discussion:
We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022566v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022566v1.full.pdf","2020-02-14","Epidemiology

"Concurrent of stunting and overweight/obesity among children: evidence from Ethiopia","Background:  Nutrition transition in many low and middle income countries (LMICs) has led to childhood nutritional outcomes to shift from a predominance of undernutrition to a dual burden of under and overnutrition. Yet, Infant and young child feeding programs in Ethiopia mainly focus on undernutrition. It is therefore crucial to assess the prevalence and determinants to better inform infant young child feeding programs.
Methods: We analyzed anthropometric, sociodemographic and dietary data of children aged 6 to 23 months from 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). A total of 2,674 children were included in the current study. Concurrent of Stunting and Overweight/Obesity (CSO) prevalence was estimated by distal, intermediate and proximal factors. To identify factors associated with CSO, we conducted hierarchical logistic regression analyses.
Results: The overall prevalence of CSO was 2.45%. The odds of CSO was significantly higher in children of low household wealth category, compared to their counter parts in the richest category (AOR=2.07, 95%CI=1.06 to 4.03, P=0.033). In boys, the likelihood of CSO was 1.60 times that of girls (95%CI =1.03 to 2.49, P =0.038). Above 12 months of age was  associated with a higher odd of CSO, compared to below 12months of age (AOR=1.76, 95% CI=1.07 to 2.88, P=0.026). 
Small birth size was significantly associated with a higher odd of CSO, compared to large birth size (AOR=2.53, 95%CI=1.45 to 4.41, P=0.001). Children who did not take vitamin A supplement within the previous six months had a higher odd of CSO, compared to those who took (AOR=1.91, 95%CI =1.19 to 3.07, P =0.007).
Conclusion:  Our study provided evidence on the co-existence of stunting and overweight/obesity among infants and young children in Ethiopia. CSO was associated with various factors originating from community and child levels. Therefore, identifying children at risk of growth flattering and excess weight gain provides IYCF programs in Ethiopia and beyond with an opportunity of earlier interventions.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022723v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022723v1.full.pdf","2020-02-14","Nutrition

"Estimating underdetection of internationally imported COVID-19 cases","Risk of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection efficiency for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore's capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, given all countries had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify country likely detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases among high surveillance countries is 40% (95% HPDI 22% -  67%), among intermediate surveillance countries it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance countries it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707v1.full.pdf","2020-02-14","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Probabilistic reconstruction of measles transmission clusters from routinely collected surveillance data","Pockets of susceptibility resulting from spatial or social heterogeneity in vaccine coverage can drive measles outbreaks, as cases imported into such pockets are likely to cause further transmission and lead to large transmission clusters. Characterising the dynamics of transmission is essential for identifying which individuals and regions might be most at risk.

As data from detailed contact tracing investigations are not available in many settings, we combined age, location, genotype, and onset date of cases in order to probabilistically reconstruct the importation status and transmission clusters within a newly developed R package called o2geosocial. 

We compared our inferred cluster size distributions to 737 transmission clusters identified through detailed contact-tracing in the United States between 2001 and 2016. We were able to reconstruct the importation status of the cases and found good agreement between the inferred and reference clusters. The results were improved when the contact-tracing investigations were used to set the importation status before running the model.

Spatial heterogeneity in vaccine coverage is difficult to measure directly. Our approach was able to highlight areas with potential for local transmission using a minimal number of variables and could be applied to assess the intensity of ongoing transmission in a region.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20020891v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20020891v1.full.pdf","2020-02-15","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Spatially Explicit Modeling of 2019-nCoV Epidemic Trend based on Mobile Phone Data in Mainland China","IAs of February 11, 2020, all prefecture-level cities in mainland China have reported confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown. The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020. We used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming.  We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. Under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21. This date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work resuming. Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three scenarios.  The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021360v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021360v2.full.pdf","2020-02-16","Epidemiology

"Optimizing diagnostic strategy for novel coronavirus pneumonia, a multi-center study in Eastern China","COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province since December 2019, and caused a rapid outbreak throughout China and globally. Cities outside Hubei are also facing great challenge and require implementing of effective and feasible strategy in precision diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).

We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22nd to February 9th, 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT-PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS.

We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory-confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients. We identified 11 of 20 co-infections in NCP cases, including regular respiratory virus, fungi and bacteria synchronously. Genomic analysis showed that 8 of 10 cases had no mutation in virus genome, while 2 cases had only one single mutation in N gene.

Our study discovered that a combination of chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and multi-plex PCR is recommended in regions outside Hubei province. Co-infection of other pathogens with SARS-CoV-2 exists and should be acknowledged. Repeated sampling, change of specimen type or metagenomics sequencing could further facilitate during critical clinical cases.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022673v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022673v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Impact of seasonal forcing on a potential SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing over 45,000 PCR confirmed infections and more than 1,000 fatalities (as of Feb 12, 2020). Imported cases and small transmission clusters have been reported globally. Early data suggest the virus transmits readily and a pandemic cannot be ruled out. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43). We use these data to explore the effect of seasonal variation in transmissibility on a potential SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A model allowing for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters of SARS-CoV-2 spread shows how a pandemic could unfold in 2020-2022. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a peak in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in winter 2020/2021. A smaller range of parameters suggests a peak in the first half of 2020 or two peaks of similar magnitude. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. 
While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained.  Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022806v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022806v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17","Epidemiology

"Clinical and serological findings of Madariaga and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viral infections: A follow-up study five years after an outbreak in Panama","Background. Human cases of Madariaga virus (MADV) infection were first detected during an outbreak in 2010 in eastern Panama, where Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) also circulates. Little is known about the long-term consequences of either alphavirus infection.
Methods. A follow-up study of the 2010 outbreak was undertaken in 2015. An additional survey was carried out two weeks after a separate 2017 alphavirus outbreak in a neighboring population in eastern Panama. Serological studies and statistical analysis were undertaken in both populations. 
Results.   Amongst the originally alphavirus-seronegative subjects (n=35 of 65), seroconversion was observed at a rate of 14.3% (95% CI: 4.8%-30.3%) for MADV and 8.6% (95% CI: 1.8%-23.1%) for VEEV over 5 years. Amongst the originally MADV seropositive subjects (n=14 of 65), VEEV seroconversion occurred in 35.7% (95% CI: 12.8%-64.9%). In the VEEV seropositive subjects (n=16 of 65), MADV seroconversion occurred in 6.3% (95% CI: 0.2%-30.2%). MADV seroreversion was observed in 14.3% (95% CI: 1.8%-42.8%) of those originally seropositive in 2010.  VEEV seroconversion in the baseline MADV-seropositive subjects was significantly higher than in alphavirus-negative subjects. In the population sampled in 2017, MADV and VEEV seroprevalence was 13.2% and 16.8%, respectively. Memory loss, insomnia, irritability and seizures were reported significantly more frequently in alphavirus-seropositive subjects than in seronegative.
Conclusions. High rates of 5-year seroconversions to MADV and VEEV suggest continuous circulation of both viruses in Panama. Enhanced susceptibility may be conferred by MADV towards VEEV. We provide evidence of persistent neurologic symptoms up to 5 years following MADV and VEEV exposure.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022798v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022798v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Carrera","/highwire/citation/72122/bibtext",95,"170220-95","17/02/2020","72122"
"Transcutaneous Cervical Vagal Nerve Stimulation Blocks Sympathetic Responses to Stress in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder","Objective: Exacerbated autonomic responses to acute stress are prevalent in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of transcutaneous cervical VNS (tcVNS) on autonomic responses to acute stress in patients with PTSD. The authors hypothesized tcVNS would reduce the sympathetic response to stress compared to a sham device.
Methods: Using a randomized double-blind approach, the effects of tcVNS on physiological responses to stress were investigated in patients with PTSD (n=25) using noninvasive sensing modalities. Participants received either sham or active tcVNS after exposure to acute personalized traumatic script stress and mental stress (public speech, mental arithmetic) over a three-day protocol. Physiological parameters related to sympathetic responses to stress were investigated.
Results: Relative to sham, tcVNS paired to traumatic script stress decreased sympathetic function as measured by: decreased heart rate (-5.6%;  +-3.6%, p<0.01), increased photoplethysmogram amplitude (peripheral vasodilation) (30.8%; +-28%, p<0.05), and increased pulse arrival time (vascular function) (6.2%; +-1.9%, p<0.0001). Similar (p < 0.05) autonomic, cardiovascular, and vascular effects were observed when tcVNS was applied after mental stress or without acute stress.
Conclusion: tcVNS attenuates sympathetic arousal associated with stress related to traumatic memories as well as mental stress in patients with PTSD, with effects persisting throughout multiple traumatic stress and stimulation testing days. These findings show that tcVNS has beneficial effects on the underlying neurophysiology of PTSD. Such autonomic metrics may also be evaluated in daily life settings in tandem with tcVNS therapy to provide closed-loop delivery and measure efficacy.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021626v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021626v2.full.pdf","2020-02-17","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Diarrhea may be underestimated: a missing link in 2019 novel coronavirus","The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan City, China. However, the clinical symptoms varied in different reports. Based on the results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed in three recent reports. As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020289v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020289v2.full.pdf","2020-02-17","Gastroenterology

"Estimation of the Time-Varying Reproduction Number of COVID-19 Outbreak in China","Background: The 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention. As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were confirmed by the National Health Commission of China.
Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers.
Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days.
Conclusions: The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but is still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to further reduce the Rc to below one in order to end the current epidemic.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021253v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021253v2.full.pdf","2020-02-17","Epidemiology

"The role of absolute humidity on transmission rates of the COVID-19 outbreak","A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has caused over 40,000 cases worldwide to date. Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022467v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022467v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17","Epidemiology

"Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics identify tobacco-use disparity in lung gene expression of ACE2, the receptor of 2019-nCov","In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed four large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107v2.full.pdf","2020-02-17","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Evaluating the accuracy of different respiratory specimens in the laboratory diagnosis and monitoring the viral shedding of 2019-nCoV infections","Background:  The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by 2019-nCoV spread rapidly, and elucidation the diagnostic accuracy of different respiratory specimens is crucial for the control and treatment of this diseases.  
Methods:  Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. 
Finding:  Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected = 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected = 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral RNAs could be detected in all the lower respiratory tract of severe cases, but not the mild cases. CT scan of cases 02, 07 and 13 showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass opacity, while no viral RNAs were detected in first three or all the upper respiratory samples.    
Interpretation:  Sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases. CT scan could serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP.

"To pool or not to pool samples for Sexually Transmitted Infections detection in Men who have Sex with Men? An evaluation of a new pooling method using the GeneXpert instrument in West-Africa.","Background: Men who have sex with Men (MSM) using Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are at risk for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). Therefore, PrEP services should include regular screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) at urethra, anorectum and pharynx. However, financial and logistic challenges arise in low resource settings. We assessed a new STI sample pooling method using the GeneXpert instrument among MSM initiating PrEP in West-Africa. 
Methods: Urine, anorectal and pharyngeal samples were pooled per individual for analysis. Unpooled samples were analyzed in case of an invalid or positive result of the pool, to identify the infection his biological location. The results of two different pooling strategies were compared against a gold standard. 
Results: We found a prevalence of 14.5% for chlamydia and 11.5% for gonorrhea, with a predominance of infections being extra-genital (77.6%). The majority of infections were asymptomatic (88.2%). The pooling strategy with unpooling of invalid results only, had a sensitivity, specificity and agreement for CT of 95.4%, 98.7% and 0.93, respectively; and 92.3%, 99.2% and 0.93 with additional unpooling of positive results. For NG, these figures were 88.9%, 97.7% and 0.85 for testing of invalid results, and 88.9%, 96.7% and 0.81 with unpooling of positive results.
Conclusion: West-African MSM have a high prevalence of extra-genital and asymptomatic STIs. The GeneXpert method provides an opportunity to move from syndromic towards etiological STI diagnosis in low income countries, as the platform is available in all African countries for tuberculosis testing. Pooling will reduce costs of triple site testing.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20017392v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20017392v2.full.pdf","2020-02-17","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"The lockdown of Hubei Province causing different transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan and Beijing","Background:
After the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) starting in late 2019, a number of researchers have reported the predicted the virus transmission dynamics. However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. 
Methods and findings:
We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 610 in Wuhan and March 2016 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase linearly.
Conclusions:
The unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global outbreak of 2019-nCoV.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021477v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021477v2.full.pdf","2020-02-17","Epidemiology

"Serial interval of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections","Objective: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs.
Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n=28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n=18). In addition, we adjusting for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.
Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).
Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019497v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019497v2.full.pdf","2020-02-17","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Transmission and epidemiological characteristics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected Pneumonia (COVID-19): preliminary evidence obtained in comparison with 2003-SARS","Objectives: Latest epidemic data of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected Pneumonia (COVID-19) was collected and a detailed statistical analysis was carried out to make comparison with 2003-SARS in order to provide scientific reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Methods: The information of COVID-19 and 2003-SARS from websites of NHCPRC and the World Health Organization was collected, and then the transmission dynamics of the two kinds of infectious diseases were analyzed. The information of 853 confirmed COVID-19 patients obtained from the website of health committees of 18 provinces. A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the COVID-19 epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed COVID-19 case data. Results: The growth rate of new cases and deaths of COVID-19 were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 853 confirmed COVID-19 cases aged 1 months to 94 years and the average age was (45.05  17.22) years. The gender ratio (M: F) was 1.12: 1. Conclusions: The fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than that of 2003-SARS and the cure rate is higher. The age of COVID-19 patients is mainly concentrated in the 30-50 years old (60.61%).

"Evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2","Background:
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 in humans was reported in Wuhan, and then spread fast to other provinces, China. We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to describe the evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission in Guangdong Province.
Methods:
A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview.
Results:
A total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan.
Conclusions:
We observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China. Although most of them were from family cluster infections, community and nosocomial infections were increasing. Our findings indicate that human-to-human transmission risks are transferring from family to community in Guangdong Province.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019141v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019141v3.full.pdf","2020-02-17","Epidemiology

We aim to devise novel ways to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in order to help researchers and other people involved in crisis response to make well-informed and targeted decisions about from which geographical locations and time periods more genetic samples may be required to fully understand the outbreak. Our approach relies on the application of Transcendental Information Cascades to a set of temporally ordered nucleotide sequences and we apply it to real-world data that was collected during the currently ongoing outbreak of the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus.

"Real time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection: Inference using exported cases","The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection who were confirmed in other countries provide a chance to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV in the early stage of epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naive population. As of 24 January 2020, with 23 exported cases, and estimating the growth rate from 8 December 2019 (scenario 1) and using the data since growth of exported cases (scenario 2), the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 5433 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 3883, 7160) and 17780 cases (95% CI: 9646, 28724), respectively. The latest estimates of the cCFR were 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.6) for scenario 1 and 7.7% (95% CI: 4.9-11.3%) for scenario 2, respectively. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.3) and 3.7 (95% CI: 3.1, 4.3) for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on the results, we note that current 2019-nCoV epidemic has a substation potential to cause a pandemic. The proposed approach can provide insights into early risk assessment using only publicly available data.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019547v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019547v2.full.pdf","2020-02-17","Epidemiology

"Assessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19)","The impact of the drastic reduction in travel volume within mainland China in January and February 2020 was quantified with respect to reports of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections outside China. Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86, 449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022897v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022897v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Anzai","/highwire/citation/72148/bibtext",16,"180220-16","18/02/2020","72148"
"A simple laboratory parameter facilitates early identification of COVID-19 patients","The total number of COVID-19 patients since the outbreak of this infection in Wuhan, China has reached 40000 and are still growing. To facilitate triage or identification of the large number of COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms in designated fever clinics, we set to identify a practical marker that could be conveniently utilized by first-line health-care workers in clinics. To do so, we performed a case-control study by analyzing clinical and laboratory findings between PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=52) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (n=53). The patients in two cohorts all had similar symptoms, mainly fever and respiratory symptoms. The rates of patients with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) or lymphopenia (two parameters suggested by current National and WHO COVID-19 guidelines) had no differences between these two cohorts, while the rate of eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (79%) was much higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (36%). When the symptoms were combined with eosinopenia, this combination led to a diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 64%, respectively, much higher than 48% and 53% when symptoms were combined with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) and/ or lymphopenia. Thus, our analysis reveals that eosinopenia may be a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor for SARS-CoV-2 infection than leukocyte counts and lymphopenia recommended by the current guidelines.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022830v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022830v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Li","/highwire/citation/72153/bibtext",17,"180220-17","18/02/2020","72153"
"Intermittent gross hematuria after lithotripsy: ureteral stent or residual stone?","Purpose: To explore the role of stone fragment and ureteric stent in process of intermittent gross hematuria (IGH), discuss the definition of ureteral stent related symptoms (USS) in a setting of lithotripsy and clinical outcomes of IGH. Methods: Between January 2018 and July 2019, patients with completed one month follow up after lithotripsy were collected. Based on whether occurrence of IGH, demographics, stent information and clinical outcomes were mainly analyzed. Results: A total of 258 consecutive patients were eventually analyzed, among which 97 patients (37.6%) suffered from IGH. Compared to patients without symptom of IGH, preoperative potassium level (3.89+0.43 mmol/L vs. 4.02+0.42 mmol/L, p=0.01), initial stone free rate (SFR, 50.52% vs. 68.32%, p=0.007) and potassium citrate application (11.34% vs. 4.55%, p=0.04) were found statistically different in univariate analysis. In multivariate logistic analysis, preoperative potassium level (OR: 0.39, CI: 0.19-0.76, p=0.007), potassium citrate (OR: 2.96, CI: 1.07-8.73, p=0.04), initial SFR (OR: 0.42, CI: 0.24-0.74, p<0.001), and hospital stay (OR: 0.94, CI: 0.89-0.99, p=0.045) were independent risk factors, rather than stent size and stent position. Hemoglobin change, stone area reduction and SFR in one-month follow-up were similar between groups, but more outpatient consultations were found in hematuria group (20 vs. 3, p<0.001), among which 2 patients were readmitted for severe ongoing hematuria. Conclusions: Stone fragment, rather the size or length of ureteral stent, is the independent risk factors of IGH. Definition of USS is not suitable for IGH after lithotripsy, and a comprehensive inform and enough rest would reduce the unnecessary medical consultations.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022590v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022590v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Peng","/highwire/citation/72156/bibtext",18,"180220-18","18/02/2020","72156"
"A deep learning algorithm using CT images to screen for Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)","The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has caused approximately 64,000 cases of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) in China so far, with that number continuing to grow. To control the spread of the disease, screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment measures is a priority. Viral nucleic acid testing based on specimens from the lower respiratory tract is the diagnostic gold standard. However, the availability and quality of laboratory testing in the infected region presents a challenge, so alternative diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we hypothesized that Artificial Intelligence's deep learning methods might be able to extract COVID-19's specific graphical features and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. To test this possibility, we collected 453 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. 217 images were used as the training set and the inception migration-learning model was used to establish the algorithm. The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 82.9% with specificity of 80.5% and sensitivity of 84%. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 73.1% with specificity of 67% and sensitivity of 74%. These results indicate the great value of using the deep learning method to extract radiological graphical features for COVID-19 diagnosis.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023028v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023028v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Wang","/highwire/citation/72159/bibtext",19,"180220-19","18/02/2020","72159"
"The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).","Contact tracing is a central public health response to infectious disease outbreaks, especially in the early stages of an outbreak when specific treatments are limited. Importation of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and elsewhere into the United Kingdom highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. Using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current UK definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate that any definition where close contact requires more than 4 hours of contact is likely to lead to uncontrolled spread.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023036v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023036v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Keeling","/highwire/citation/72162/bibtext",20,"180220-20","18/02/2020","72162"
"Clinical Characteristics of 2019 Novel Infected Coronavirus Pneumonia:A Systemic Review and Meta-analysis","Background:A Novel pneumonia associated with the 2019 coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) suddenly broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019. 37287 confirmed cases and 813 death case in China (Until 8th/Feb/2019) have been reported in just fortnight. Although this risky pneumonia with high infection rates and high mortality rates need to be resolved immediately, major gaps in our knowledge of clinical characters of it were still not be established. The aim of this study is to summaries and analysis the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.
Methods: Literature have been systematically performed a search on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, GreyNet International, and The Cochrane Library from inception up to February 8, 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess quality, and publication bias was analyzed by Egger test. In the single-arm meta-analysis, A fix-effects model was used to obtain a pooled incidence rate. We conducted subgroup analysis according to geographic region and research scale.
Results: A total of nine studies including 356 patients were included in this study, the mean age was 52.4 years and 221 (62.1%) were male. The pooled incidences rate of symptoms as follows: pharyngalgia (12.2%, 95% CI: 0.087-0.167), diarrhea (9.2%, 95% CI: 0.062-0.133) and headache (8.9%, 95% CI: 0.063-0.125). Meanwhile, 5.7% (95% CI: 0.027-0.114) of patients were found without any symptoms although they were diagnosed by RT-PCR. In the terms of CT imaging examination, the most of patients showed bilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity, 8.6% (95% CI: 0.048-0.148) of patients with crazy-paving pattern, and 11.5% (95% CI: 0.064-0.197) of patients without obvious CT imaging presentations. The pooled incidence of mortality was 8.9% (95% CI: 0.062-0.126).

"Estimating the Efficacy of Traffic Blockage and Quarantine for the Epidemic Caused by 2019-nCoV (COVID-19)","Since the outbreaks of the epidemic in Wuhan, China caused by 2019-nCoV (COVID-19), the cumulative number of confirmed cases are increasing day by day and a large number of population all over the world were at risk. The traffic blockage and quarantine can alleviate the risk of larger epidemic and lower the number of infections, which is essential to adjusting the control polices and instructing the public responses.
	A Flow-SEIR model was used to estimate the number of infections, based on the confirmed cases data released by the National Health Commission of China and the migration data during the Chinese Spring Festival by the Baidu Migration. We define two factors related to traffic blockage and quarantine to estimate the efficacy of these two intervation measures. In our study, since the government urges the public to stay at home and self-protective, the self-protection at home is also accounted as a part of quarantine. 
In the results, the quarantine is very effective for epidemic control, which can reduce the number of infections by nearly 90%. And the effect of quarantine is stronger than the traffic blockage control. Early warning of epidemic situation is significantly important to the adjustment of traffic blockage control policy. If there is 1 day in advance for urban blockage, about 3600 people will eventually be reduced in the country. If there is 1 day of delay, about 1800 people will finally be at risk. However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of the infections.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022913v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022913v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Li","/highwire/citation/72164/bibtext",22,"180220-22","18/02/2020","72164"
"Estimation of Rift Valley fever virus spillover to humans during the Mayotte 2018-2019 epidemic","Background. Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging, zoonotic, arboviral haemorrhagic fever threatening livestock and humans mainly in Africa. In the absence of a human vaccine, estimating the transmission potential of RVF virus from livestock to humans is key to assessing the impact of livestock disease control measures on preventing human disease.
Methods. We combined a unique RVF dataset, with livestock and human surveillance data of the 2018-2019 RVF epidemic in Mayotte, and used them in a mathematical model. Using Bayesian inference, we quantified the transmission amongst livestock and spillover to humans, and we assessed the impact of livestock vaccination on reducing human disease risk.
Findings. Vaccination scenarios indicate that early livestock vaccination (December 2018) would have reduced the human epidemic size by a third, whilst vaccinating one month later required using 50 % more vaccine doses for a similar impact. In addition, the likelihood of virus re-emergence in the next rainy season (2019-2020) was estimated very low, with 55.8 % (90 Credible Interval [27.1-59.5]) of the livestock population being immune in August 2019.
Interpretation. Human and livestock health surveillance, early detection, and timely vaccination in livestock are crucial to reducing disease risk in humans. We present the first study quantifying RVF virus spillover using livestock and human data, and use this quantitative information to inform on the impact of potential control programmes. This demonstrates the value of a One Health approach to surveillance and control of this emerging
infectious disease. Funding. ARS Ocean Indien, EAFRD, RITA Mayotte, VEEPED, Wellcome.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022996v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022996v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Metras","/highwire/citation/72165/bibtext",23,"180220-23","18/02/2020","72165"
"Mapping malaria by sharing spatial information between incidence and prevalence datasets","As malaria incidence decreases and more countries move towards elimination, maps of malaria risk in low prevalence areas are increasingly needed. For low burden areas, disaggregation regression models have been developed to estimate risk at high spatial resolution from routine surveillance reports aggregated by administrative unit polygons.
However, in areas with both routine surveillance data and prevalence surveys, models that
make use of the spatial information from prevalence point-surveys have great potential.
Using case studies in Indonesia, Senegal and Madagascar, we compare two methods for
incorporating point-level, spatial information into disaggregation regression models. The
first simply fits a Gaussian random field to prevalence point-surveys to create a new covariate. The second is a multi-likelihood model that is fitted jointly to prevalence point-surveys and polygon incidence data. We find that the simple model generally performs better than a baseline disaggregation model while the joint model performance was mixed. More generally, our results demonstrate that combining these types of data improves estimates of malaria incidence.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023069v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023069v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Lucas","/highwire/citation/72166/bibtext",24,"180220-24","18/02/2020","72166"
"Bias Attributable to Composite Outcome","Background: Little guidance is available on how composite outcomes should be interpreted, especially in situations of varied direction in the association across the event subtypes. I proposed an index to evaluate the bias attributable to composite outcomes (BACO) and applied it in recently published clinical trials.
Methods: I defined the BACO index as the ratio between logarithms of the association measures of both a composite outcome and its most relevant component (e.g., any-cause mortality). By using the non-linear combination of parameters, based on the delta method, I calculated the confidence intervals and performed Wald-type tests for the null hypotheses (BACO index = 1). I applied this method in systematically selected clinical trials, and in two other preselected trials which I considered ""positive controls"". These last trials have been recognized as examples of primary composite outcomes that were disregarded because of inconsistency with the treatment effect on mortality. 
Results: BACO index values different from one were classified according to whether the use of composite outcomes overestimated (BACO index >1), underestimated (BACO index between zero and <1), or inverted (BACO index <0) the association between exposure and prognosis. In three of 23 clinical trials and the two positive controls, the BACO indices were significantly lower than one (using p <0.005 as a preset cutoff). 
Conclusion: Based on the BACO index testing, researchers could predefined rules to make impartial decisions about maintaining a composite outcome as the primary endpoint or to state cautions regarding its interpretation.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20020966v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20020966v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Diaz-Quijano","/highwire/citation/72167/bibtext",25,"180220-25","18/02/2020","72167"
"Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (COVID-19)","Background
Estimation of the fraction and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection.  
Methods
Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness.  
Results
We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably.
Conclusions
A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023127v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023127v1.full.pdf","2020-02-17",NA,"Li","/highwire/citation/72168/bibtext",26,"180220-26","18/02/2020","72168"
"Analysis of meteorological conditions and prediction of epidemic trend of 2019-nCoV infection in 2020","Objective: To investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of 2019-nCoV infection, to predict the epidemiology of the infectious disease, and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease. 
Methods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources.
Results: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end.
Conclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022715v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022715v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Estimating the distribution of the incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection between travelers to Hubei, China and non-travelers","Objectives: Amid the continuing spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the incubation period of COVID-19 should be regularly re-assessed as more information is available upon the increase in reported cases. The present work estimated the distribution of incubation periods of patients infected in and outside Hubei province of China. 
Methods: Clinical data were collected from the individual cases reported by the media as they were not fully available on the official pages of the Chinese health authorities. MLE was used to estimate the distributions of the incubation period.
Results: It was found that the incubation period of patients with no travel history to Hubei was longer and more volatile.

"Can Search Query Forecast successfully in China's 2019-nCov pneumonia?","Recently the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) pneumonia outbreak in China then the world, and the Number of infections and death continues to increases. Search Query performs well in forecasting the epidemics. It is still a question whether search engine data can forecast the drift and the inflexion in 2019-nCov pneumonia. Based on the Baidu Search Index, we propose three prediction models: composite Index, composite Index with filtering and suspected NCP(Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia). The result demonstrates that the predictive model of composite index with filtering performs the best while the model of suspected NCP has the highest forecast error. We further predict the out-of-the-set NCP confirmed cases and monitor that the next peak of new diagnoses will occur on February 16th and 17th.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022400v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022400v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Epidemiology

"Transdiagnostic neurocognitive endophenotypes in major psychiatric illness","We aimed to characterize potential transdiagnostic neurocognitive endophenotypes in a large cohort of multiplex families affected with two or more individuals having a major psychiatric illness(MPI) i.e., schizophrenia(SCZ), bipolar disorder(BPAD), substance use disorders(SUD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD). We recruited 640 individuals that included 256 affected individuals with MPI, 227 of their unaffected first-degree relatives(FDR) and 157 population healthy-controls(PHC). Neurocognitive battery included assessments of executive function, working memory, social cognition, verbal learning and recall. Linear mixed effects models were applied to the neurocognitive components to examine their transdiagnostic and endophenotype status after accounting for demographic and family variables. We also examined the relationship of cognitive domains with diagnosis-specific Family History Density score(FHD).
The deficits in cognitive flexibility, working memory and social cognition were transdiagnostic; processing speed was impaired in SCZ and BPAD groups while verbal learning and recall in SCZ, BPAD and SUD groups. These deficits with the exception of social cognition, worsened with age and parental education had protective effect. The unaffected FDRs had deficits in all the domains except processing speed in comparison to PHC; social cognition deficits were comparable to affected individuals. The diagnosis-specific FHD analysis showed that deficits in cognitive flexibility, working memory and social cognition were endophenotypes across disorders.
Evaluation of neurocognitive functions across multiple affected individuals in a large multiplex family-based cross-disorder cohort, has the potential to elucidate transdiagnostic as well as endophenotype vulnerabilities to psychiatric illness. This study adds to the emerging conceptualization of psychiatric illness as a combination of both diagnosis-specific and transdiagnostic markers.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022863v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022863v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"A model simulation study on effects of intervention measures in Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic","Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7  1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5  559099.9 by the end of period 2 (day70) in free transmission state. And at day90, total patients number is 913396.5  559099.9. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. This will put great burden on the shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectious disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023168v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023168v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Epidemiology

"SMPD1 variants do not have a major role in REM sleep behavior disorder","Mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene were reported to be associated with Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The majority of patients with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) develop PD or DLB later in life, suggesting that iRBD is a prodromal phase of these two conditions. In the current study we aimed to evaluate the role of SMPD1 variants in iRBD. SMPD1 and its untranslated regions were sequenced using targeted next-generation sequencing in 959 iRBD patients and 1,287 controls from European descent. Logistic regression adjusted for sex and age showed no significant associations with two common variants and iRBD (rs1050239 and rs8164). The frequency of all rare nonsynonymous SMPD1 variants (minor allele frequency <1%) was found to be twice as high in cases than in controls (1.46% vs. 0.70%, Fisher's exact test p=0.09) but there was no statistically significant burden (p=0.64). Our study reports no statistically significant association of SMPD1 variants and iRBD.

"Machine Learning Can Predict Deaths in Patients with Diverticulitis During their Hospital Stay","Introduction: Diverticulitis is the inflammation and/or infection of small pouches known as diverticula that develop along the walls of the intestines. Patients with diverticulitis are at risk of mortality as high as 17% with abscess formation and 45% with secondary perforation, especially patients that get admitted to the inpatient services are at risk of complications including mortality. We developed a deep neural networks (DNN) based machine learning framework that could predict premature death in patients that are admitted with diverticulitis using electronic health records (EHR) to calculate the statistically significant risk factors first and then to apply deep neural network.
Methods: Our proposed framework (Deep FLAIM) is a two-phase hybrid works framework. In the first phase, we used National In-patient Sample 2014 dataset to extract patients with diverticulitis patients with and without hemorrhage with the ICD-9 codes 562.11 and 562.13 respectively and analyzed these patients for different risk factors for statistical significance with  univariate and multivariate analyses to generate hazard ratios, to rank the diverticulitis associated risk factors. In the second phase, we applied deep neural network model to predict death. Additionally, we have compared the performance of our proposed system by using the popular machine learning models such as DNN and Logistic Regression (LR).
Results: A total of 128,258 patients were used, we tested 64 different variables for using univariate and multivariate (age, gender and ethnicity) cox-regression for significance only 16 factors were statistically significant for both univariate and multivariate analysis. The mortality prediction for our DNN out-performed the conventional machine learning (logistic regression) in terms of AUC (0.977 vs 0.904), training accuracy (0.931 vs 0.900), testing accuracy (0.930 vs 0.910) , sensitivity (90% vs 88%) and specificity (95% vs 93%).   
Conclusion: Our FLAIM-DNN-4RS can predict mortality in patients admitted to the hospital with diverticulitis with high accuracy. The proposed framework can be expanded to predict premature death for other disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020222v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020222v2.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Health Informatics

"Effects of Altered Neural Input and Botulinum Toxin on Finger and Wrist Passive Properties in Chronic Hemiparetic Stroke","Background and Purpose: Following a hemiparetic stroke, prolonged altered motor neuron inputs may drive passive mechanical changes within muscle that further amplify brain injury induced motor impairments, reducing optimal recovery. However, due to confounding factors, i.e. muscle hypertonicity and spasticity, and the use of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), chemical denervation to reduce their expression, there is no consensus on how altered neural inputs following a stroke affect muscle passive mechanical properties or the extent to which these properties ultimately limit functional recovery. Therefore, the objective of this study is to quantify muscle passive biomechanical properties following chronic hemiparetic stroke and BoNT.
Methods: Passive torques about the wrist and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints were quantified in both hands of 34 individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Participants' hand impairments ranged from severe to mild with a subset who previously received BoNT injections. Torques were quantified with subjects in a sleep or near-sleep state, mitigating muscle hyperactivity. EMGs were continuously monitored to ensure no muscle activity during data collection. 
Results: Participants who previously received BoNT injections demonstrated significantly greater passive flexion torques about their paretic wrist and fingers as compared to those who never received BoNT. As a result, only the group who received BoNT demonstrated significant decreases in passive MCP extension.
Conclusions: The results of our thorough investigation of in vivo passive elastic torques at the wrist and fingers in chronic hemiparetic stroke contrast with the increased stiffness and decreased passive ROM observed clinically and in many previous studies. We highlight the need to effective address both stroke-induced muscle hyperactivity and BoNT treatment history as confounds. We conclude that loss of hand function post-stroke is predominantly due to motor impairments post stroke. Adverse effects of BoNT warrant consideration in future studies and rehabilitation interventions.","/content/10.1101/19011312v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011312v2.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Clinical diagnosis of 8274 samples with 2019-novel coronavirus in Wuhan","Background: 
2019-Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreaks create challenges for hospital laboratories because thousands of samples must be evaluated each day. Sample types, interpretation methods, and corresponding laboratory standards must be established. The possibility of other infections should be assessed to provide a basis for clinical classification, isolation, and treatment. Accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated the testing methods for 2019-nCoV and co-infections.
Methods: 
We used a fluorescence-based quantitative PCR kit urgently distributed by the Chinese CDC to detect 8274 close contacts in the Wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-nCoV genome. We also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens; 316 subjects were also tested for 2019-nCoV.
Findings: 
Among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-nCoV infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed negative results in the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test (non-019-nCoV); and 252 cases (3.0%) because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. Sixteen patients who originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 14 patients (87.5%) were finally defined as 2019-nCoV-positive, and 2 (12.5%) were finally defined as negative. The positive rates of nCoV-NP and nCovORF1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. nCoV-NP-positive only and nCovORF1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. In the 316 patients with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-nCov and 6/104 had co-infection with coronavirus (3/104), influenza A virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza A H3N2 (1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza A virus (11/202), influenza A H3N2 (11/202), rhinovirus (10/202), respiratory syncytial virus (7/202), influenza B virus (6/202), metapneumovirus (4/202), and coronavirus (2/202).
Interpretation: Clinical testing methods for 2019-nCoV require improvement. Importantly, 5.8% of 2019-nCoV infected and 18.4% of non-2019-nCoV-infected patients had other pathogen infections. It is important to treat combined infections and perform rapid screening to avoid cross-contamination of patients. A test that quickly and simultaneously screens as many pathogens as possible is needed.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022327v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022327v2.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCoV, in the nasal tissue","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells. We hope this study could be informative for virus-prevention strategy development, especially the treatment of nasal mucus.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022228v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022228v2.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study","Background: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to 46,997 confirmed cases as of 13th February 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.
 
Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.
 
Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.
 
Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019901v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019901v2.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Assessing the Tendency of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) Outbreak in China","Since December 8, 2019, the spread of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) is increasing day by day. It is particularly important to predict the trend of the epidemic for the timely adjustment of the economy and industries. A Flow-SEHIR model is proposed to perform empirical analysis for Hubei Province and those ares in China outside Hubei. 
It is shown that the time when new confirmed cases number has reached a peak level, i.e. the inflection point, is verified to be on February 6 - 10. The maximum of temporal infected cases number is represented by peak value. The predicted peak value in China except Hubei was estimated as 31300 (95% CI: 27700 - 36800). The peak arrival time is on March 3 - 9. The number of real-time patients in most areas of China outside Hubei will peak from March 2 to March 24. The peak values of more than 60% provinces or regions in China will be controlled within 1000. Considering the false-negative rate of nucleic acid detection is 0.5, the real peak cumulative number of patients in Hubei is estimated between 214400 - 472500.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021444v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021444v2.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Epidemiology

"Early evaluation of transmission control measures in response to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China","Background:
An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, and has spread throughout China and to other countries. On 23 January 2020, in an attempt to contain the epidemic, non-essential travel was prohibited in and out of Wuhan city, a major transport hub and conurbation of 11 million people. Since then China has implemented nationwide its highest level (Level 1) of emergency response to further contain the spread of infection within and among cities.

Methods:
We used generalized linear regression models to investigate the effect of the type and timing of transmission control measures on the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan city, and on the growth of the epidemic in 296 other cities across China. In addition to the Wuhan city shutdown, as part of the emergency response, entertainment venues were closed, public gatherings banned, intra-city public transport (bus and subway rail) suspended, and travel to and from other cities prohibited.

Findings:
The Wuhan city travel ban slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by an estimated 2.91 days (95% CI: 2.54-3.29) on average. Among the other urban centres across mainland China, cities that implemented control measures pre-emptively, before the first case was reported, had 37% fewer cases in the week following the first reported case (13.0, 95%CI 7.1-18.8) compared with cities starting control after the first case (20.6, 95%CI: 14.5-26.8). Among individual control measures investigated, the most effective were suspending intra-city public transport, and closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings.

Interpretation: 
The implementation of transmission control measures slowed the dispersal of infection from its origin in Wuhan city and reduced the numbers of cases reported during the early stages of the epidemic in hundreds of other Chinese cities.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019844v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019844v3.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"A deep learning algorithm using CT images to screen for Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)","Background: To control the spread of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment measures is a priority.  Pathogenic laboratory testing is the diagnostic gold standard but it is time consuming with significant false positive results. Fast and accurate diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we hypothesized that deep learning methods might be able to extract COVID-19's graphical features and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. 
Methods:We collected 453 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. We modified the Inception migration-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. 
Findings: The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 82.9% with specificity of 80.5% and sensitivity of 84%. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 73.1% with specificity of 67% and sensitivity of 74%. 
Interpretation: These results demonstrate the proof-of-principle for using artificial intelligence to extract radiological features for timely and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.

"Deep-learning-based Prediction of Late Age-Related Macular Degeneration Progression","Both genetic and environmental factors influence the etiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness. AMD severity is primarily measured by fundus images and recently developed machine learning methods can successfully predict AMD progression using image data. However, none of these methods have utilized both genetic and image data for predicting AMD progression. Here we jointly used genotypes and fundus images to predict an eye as having progressed to late AMD with a modified deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In total, we used 31,262 fundus images and 52 AMD-associated genetic variants from 1,351 subjects from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) with disease severity phenotypes and fundus images available at baseline and follow-up visits over a period of 12 years. Our results showed that fundus images coupled with genotypes could predict late AMD progression with an averaged area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.83-0.86). The results using fundus images alone showed an averaged AUC of 0.81 (95%CI: 0.80-0.83). We implemented our model in a cloud-based application for individual risk assessment.","/content/10.1101/19006171v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006171v2.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Ophthalmology

"Incubation Period and Other Epidemiological Characteristics of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infections with Right Truncation: A Statistical Analysis of Publicly Available Case Data","The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.20018754v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.20018754v2.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Estimating the Efficacy of Traffic Blockage and Quarantine for the Epidemic Caused by 2019-nCoV (COVID-19)","Since the  2019-nCoV (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day,  and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk. The traffic blockage and quarantine can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections. Evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine.
	We apply our Flow-SEIR model to estimate the number of infections as well as the evaluate the policy of traffic blockage and quarantine, based on the data of confirmed case and the migration in China. We define two factors related to traffic blockage and quarantine to estimate the efficacy of these two intervation measures. In our study, since the public are urged to stay at home and self-protective, the self-protection at home is also accounted as a part of quarantine. 
In the simulated results, the quarantine is very effective for epidemic control, when the quarantine factor e is close to 1, all the population is isolated from others, the peak number of infections will decrease by 89.68%. And the traffic blockage is also effective, however, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of the infections.
For Hubei Province, if the quarantine is 1 week earlier, the peak number of infections will decrease by 24.26% - 25.33%, if the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of infections only decreased by 3.10% - 3.79%. For the other provinces outside Hubei, if the quarantine is one week of earlier, the peak number will decrease by 32.78% - 35.60%, if the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of infections will decrease by 15.30% - 16.70%. If there is one day in advance for urban blockage, about 3,600 people will eventually be reduced in the country. If there is one day of delay, about 1,800 people will finally be at risk. In general, the effect of quarantine is even stronger than the traffic blockage control. 
The fact should not be ignored that there are still a large number of population who are exposed to the SARS-COV-2 but not yet symptomatic. Those exposed population is not easy to be found and infect others who are closely contacting with. So the traffic blockage and quarantine should be continued for a long time util the epidemic is totally under control.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022913v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022913v2.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Epidemiology

"Quantifying bias of COVID-19 prevalence and severity estimates in Wuhan, China that depend on reported cases in international travelers","Risk of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore's capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22% -  67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707v2.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Epidemic analysis of COVID-19 in China by dynamical modeling","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic has attracted world- wide attention. Herein, we propose a mathematical model to analyzes this epidemic, based on a dynamic mechanism that incorporating the intrinsic impact of hidden la- tent and infectious cases on the entire process of transmission. Meanwhile, this model is validated by data correlation analysis, predicting the recent public data, and back- tracking, as well as sensitivity analysis. The dynamical model reveals the impact of various measures on the key parameters of the epidemic. According to the public data of NHCs from 01/20 to 02/09, we predict the epidemic peak and possible end time for 5 different regions. The epidemic in Beijing and Shanghai, Mainland/Hubei and Hubei/Wuhan, are expected to end before the end of February, and before mid- March respectively. The model indicates that, the outbreak in Wuhan is predicted to be ended in the early April. As a result, more effective policies and more efforts on clinical research are demanded. Moreover, through the backtracking simulation, we infer that the outbreak of the epidemic in Mainland/Hubei, Hubei/Wuhan, and Wuhan can be dated back to the end of December 2019 or the beginning of January 2020.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023465v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023465v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Epidemiology

[Results] From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, a total of 66,492 cases of NCP were confirmed in China mainland, a total of 54,406 cases were confirmed in Hubei Province, a total of 37,914 cases were confirmed in Wuhan city. On February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of NCP in China mainland reached a maximum of 5,328. Since then, the suspected cases have shown a significant downward trend. On February 4, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has gradually decreased in China mainland since then. On February 12, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland increased explosively to 15,152, and then began to decline. From February 3, 2020, except for Hubei Province, In China mainland, the number of newly confirmed cases of NCP has continued to decline; From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, a total of 1,523 cases of NCP deaths in China mainland, a cumulative cure of 8096 cases, and  mortality and cure rate were 2.29% (1523/66492) and 12.18% (8096/66492) respectively; Starting from January 27, 2020, The spread index of NCP gradually declined, and the extinction index of NCP rose  little by little from January 29, 2020. [Conclusion] Starting from February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of the NCP is gradually decrease in China mainland. From February 3, 2020, the number of newly confirmed cases of NCP is continuous decline in China mainland except Hubei Province, This shows that the control of the transmission of NCP has achieved. Judged from the number of confirmed cases of NCP, controlling the outbreak in China mainland is to control the epidemic in Hubei province, and the key to controlling the outbreak in Hubei province is to control the epidemic in Wuhan city; Judging from the gradual increase in the number and cure rate of the NCP, and the gradual decline in the number of deaths and mortality, the trend of outbreak control and treatment is getting better; A decrease of the NCP spread index indicates a slowdown in the spread of the virus, but the cumulative confirmed cases is still increase, so the epidemic will continue for some time. However, the turning point of the epidemic in mainland China has not yet occurred. On February 12, 2020, the turning point of the epidemic in China mainland except Hubei province, has turned up.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024034v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024034v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Epidemiology

"Study on SARS-COV-2 transmission and the effects of control measures in China","Objective
To reconstruct the transmission trajectory of SARS-COV-2 and analyze the effects of control measures in China.
Methods
Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and a back propagation class to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A limitation factor for the medical resource was imposed to model the infected but not quarantined. Credible data source from Baidu Qianxi were used to assess the number of infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other areas.
Results
Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 in the very early stage. The true infected number was 4508 in our model in Wuhan before January 22, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan, stage 1), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 1) and 3.3 (China except Hubei, stage 1) to 0.67 (Wuhan, stage 4), 0.83 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 2) and 0.63 (China except Hubei, stage 2), respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073, 21342 and 13384 infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively, and there would be 2179, 633 and 107 death in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively.
Conclusion
A series of control measures in China have effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19, and the epidemic will end in early April.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023770v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023770v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Epidemiology

"Evaluating new evidence in the early dynamics of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China with real time domestic traffic and potential asymptomatic transmissions","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to 28 countries/regions with over 43,000 confirmed cases. Much about this outbreak is still unknown, and at this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate different sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. This study aims to integrate recent infection evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 and updated real time domestic traffic data to infer the early dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. A recent concern is the potential presence of asymptomatic transmissions. A modified SEIR model was used to infer the length of the asymptomatic infectious stage to evaluate empirical support for its presence. Based on current evidence, this study found little empirical evidence supporting the presence of asymptomatic transmission. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with and a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced. The estimated case confirmation rate has been low but has increased steadily to 23.37% on average. Continuing work is needed, especially in monitoring the current infection status of Wuhan residents.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023440v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023440v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Epidemiology

"Sleep disruption after brain injury is associated with worse motor outcomes and slower functional recovery","Background and Aims: Sleep is important for consolidation of motor learning, but brain injury may affect sleep continuity and therefore rehabilitation outcomes. This study aims to assess the relationship between sleep quality and motor recovery in brain injury patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation. 
Methods: 59 patients with brain injury were recruited from two specialist inpatient rehabilitation units.  Sleep quality was assessed (up to 3 times) objectively using actigraphy (7 nights) and subjectively using the Sleep Condition Indicator. Motor outcome assessments included: Action Research Arm test (upper limb function), Fugl Meyer assessment (motor impairment) and the Rivermead Mobility Index. The functional independence measure (FIM) was assessed at admission and discharge by the clinical team. 55 age and gender matched healthy controls completed one assessment.
Results: Inpatients demonstrated lower self-reported sleep quality (p<0.001) and more fragmented sleep (p<0.001) than controls. For inpatients, sleep fragmentation explained significant additional variance in motor outcomes, over and above that explained by admission FIM score (p<0.017), such that more disrupted sleep was associated with poorer motor outcomes. Using stepwise linear regression, sleep fragmentation was the only variable found to explain variance in rate of change in FIM (R2adj = 0.12, p = 0.03), whereby more disrupted sleep was associated with slower recovery. 
Conclusions: Inpatients with brain injury demonstrate impaired sleep quality, and this is associated with poorer motor outcomes and slower functional recovery. Further investigation is needed to determine how sleep quality can be improved and whether this affects outcome.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20022384v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20022384v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"When will the battle against novel coronavirus end in Wuhan: a SEIR modeling analysis","Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns. By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R0=1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47),TI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200,000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed.

"Longitudinal characteristics of lymphocyte responses and cytokine profiles in the peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients","Background: The dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines profiles of patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their correlation with the disease severity remain unclear.

Method: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. 

Findings: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-<U+03B3> levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19.

Conclusion: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. N8R may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023671v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023671v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Estimating the Case Fatality Risk of COVID-19 using Cases from Outside China","There is large uncertainty around the case fatality risk (CFR) for COVID-19 in China. Therefore, we considered symptomatic cases outside of China (countries/settings with 20+ cases) and the proportion who are in intensive care units (4.0%, 14/349 on 13 February 2020). Given what is known about CFRs for ICU patients with severe respiratory conditions from a meta-analysis, we estimated a CFR of 1.37% (95%CI: 0.57% to 3.22%) for COVID-19 cases outside of China.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023499v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023499v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Public and Global Health

"Simulating and Forecasting the Cumulative Confirmed Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in China by Boltzmann Function-based Regression Analyses","Background: An ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) hits Wuhan City (the capital of Hubei Province) and has spread to other provinces/cities of China and overseas. It very urgent to forecast the spread of the outbreak and estimate how many infected cases will be finally confirmed. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential total number of confirmed cases in mainland China, in Hubei Province, in Wuhan City and in other most affected provinces/cities, respectively. The results may help to contain this public health emergency.

Methods: We used data of cumulative confirmed cases from Jan 21, 2019, to 14, Feb 2020 released daily by the National Health Commission of China and provincial health commissions. The Boltzmann function was explored to simulate the cumulative number of confirmed cases of each province/city and also of mainland China. Using these established functions, we forecasted the national and provincial trends of confirmed cases in the coming weeks. In addition, data of the cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and worldwide were collected from the WHO official website and analyzed similarly. A Monte Carlo technique was applied to analyze the uncertainty of estimates on cumulative confirmed cases, and the results were presented using the resulting mean, median, and 95% confidence interval (CI).

Findings: The data of cumulative confirmed cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 with respect to each region were all well-fitted to the Boltzmann function (R2 for all regression analyses being close to 0.999). The potential total number of confirmed cases in mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces were estimated as 79467 (95% CI 71348, 96569), 64261 (57993, 76056), 46607 (41245, 58129) and 13906 (12727, 15901), respectively; those for the six most affected provinces (Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi) were 1410 (1325, 1539), 1265 (1201, 1361), 1369 (1263, 1548), 1136 (1048, 1294), 1110 (1021, 1269) and 1123 (947, 1144), respectively; those for top-4 major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen) were 429 (395, 487), 356 (334, 392), 365 (347, 393) and 430 (409, 460), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in China (including Hubei Province) will become minimal between Feb 27, 2020, and Mar 13, 2020 with 95% CI. In addition, we found that the data of cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and Worldwide were also well fitted to Boltzmann function.  

Interpretation: The observations that data of cumulative confirmed cases for both the on-going SARS-CoV-2 and 2003 SARS-CoV were well fitted with the Boltzmann function strongly suggest that it is suitable to simulate epidemics caused by these coronaviruses. However, due to the uncertainty associated with the released data, the obtained potential total number of confirmed cases and key dates estimated for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak should not be used directly for making public health related decisions.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Risk map of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China: proportionate control is needed","Background
China is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused.
Methods and findings
We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%.
Conclusions
The pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities/regions. We recommend to adopt proportionate control policy according to the risk level to reduce unnecessary economic loss.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023838v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023838v1.full.pdf","2020-02-18","Epidemiology

"Automatic Detection of Target Engagement in Transcutaneous Cervical Vagal Nerve Stimulation for Traumatic Stress Triggers","Transcutaneous cervical vagal nerve stimulation (tcVNS) devices are attractive alternatives to surgical implants, and can be applied for a number of conditions in ambulatory settings, including stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Transferring tcVNS technologies to at-home settings brings challenges associated with the assessment of therapy response. The ability to accurately detect whether tcVNS has been effectively delivered in a remote setting such as the home has never been investigated. We designed and conducted a study in which 12 human subjects received active tcVNS and 14 received sham stimulation in tandem with traumatic stress, and measured continuous cardiopulmonary signals including the electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), seismocardiogram (SCG), and respiratory effort (RSP). We extracted physiological parameters related to autonomic nervous system activity, and created a feature set from these parameters to: 1) detect active (vs. sham) tcVNS stimulation presence with machine learning methods, and 2) determine which sensing modalities and features provide the most salient markers of tcVNS-based changes in physiological signals. Heart rate (ECG), vasomotor activity (PPG), and pulse arrival time (ECG+PPG) provided sufficient information to determine target engagement (compared to sham) in addition to other combinations of sensors. resulting in 96% accuracy, precision, and recall with a receiver operator characteristics area of 0.96. Two commonly utilized sensing modalities (ECG and PPG) that are suitable for home use can provide useful information on therapy response for tcVNS. The methods presented herein could be deployed in wearable devices to quantify adherence for at-home use of tcVNS technologies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018689v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018689v2.full.pdf","2020-02-19","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

We retrospectively collected infection data from 2 January to 22 January at six departments from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. In our study, we found N95 respirators, disinfection and hand washing can help to reduce the risk of 2019-nCoV infection in medical staffs. Our results call for re-emphasizing strict occupational protection code in battling this novel contagious disease.

"Systematic review protocol: Quantitative susceptibility mapping of brain iron accumulation in neurodegenerative diseases.","Iron has been found to play an important role in neurodegeneration. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a relatively new, and the most accurate, MRI technique available for assessment of iron deposition in the brain. There is a rapidly growing number of studies using QSM to investigate brain iron distribution in neurodegenerative diseases including but not limited to Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease and Wilson disease. These studies have shown increased iron deposition in the brain regions that are associated with the pathology of the disease. Additionally, QSM is found to be accurate in differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases where clinical presentations are indistinguishable. Structural changes evidenced by QSM are reported to precede the onset of clinical manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases suggesting its benefit in early diagnosis. To our knowledge, no systematic review of QSM findings in neurodegenerative diseases has been published before. A systematic synthesis and conclusion of the existing evidence can improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration, describe the clinical and research utility of QSM, and point out the direction for future studies in neuropsychiatric disorders.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20022608v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20022608v1.full.pdf","2020-02-19","Neurology

The individuals from the country of risk of COVID-19 are included a home-quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain. 
To estimate the possible number of infected individuals due to the large influx of international students, the deterministic compartment was modeled by different compliance of home-quarantine.
Our findings, under the strict compliance of quarantine for the incoming international students, indicate it is less likely to occur epidemics in South Korea.

"COVID-19 in a Designated Infectious Diseases HospitalOutside Hubei Province,China","Background
A new type of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Previous investigations reported patients in Wuhan city often progressed into severe or critical and had a high mortality rate.The clinical characteristics of affected patients outside the epicenter of Hubei province are less well understood.
Methods
All confirmed COVID-19 case treated in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen,from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of these cases to better inform patient management in normal hospital settings. 
Results
Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233(81.5%) had been to Hubei while 42(14%) had not clear epidemiological history. Only 192(64%) cases presented with fever as initial symptom. The lymphocyte count decreased in 38% patients after admission. The number (percent) of cases classified as non-severe and severe was 240(80.6%) and 58(19.4%) respectively. Thirty-two patients (10.7%) needed ICU care. Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of CRP, IL-6 and ESR. The median (IRQ) duration of positive viral test were 14(10-19). Slower clearance of virus was associated with higher risk of progression to severe clinical condition. As of February 14, 2020, 66(22.1%) patients were discharged and the overall mortality rate remains 0.
Conclusions
In a designated hospital outside the Hubei Province, COVID-19 patients were mainly characterized by mild symptoms and could be effectively manage by properly using the existing hospital system.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024018v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024018v1.full.pdf","2020-02-19","Public and Global Health

"Contacts in context: large-scale setting-specific social mixing matrices from the BBC Pandemic project","Social mixing patterns are crucial in driving transmission of infectious diseases and informing public health interventions to contain their spread. Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (such as school closures, social distancing, or working from home). In addition, they finally provide the possibility to use multiple sources of social mixing data to evaluate the uncertainty that stems from social mixing when designing public health interventions.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023754v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023754v1.full.pdf","2020-02-19","Epidemiology

"Clinical and immunologic features in severe and moderate forms of Coronavirus Disease 2019","Background Since late December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia cases caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and continued to spread throughout China and across the globe. To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported.
Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases.
Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/L) than moderate cases (11000 million/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4 U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). IL-2R, TNF-a and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6 pg/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/L). The expressions of IFN-<U+03B3> by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%).
Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-<U+03B3> production, which may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023903v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023903v1.full.pdf","2020-02-19","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Utilize State Transition Matrix Model to Predict the Novel Corona Virus Infection Peak and Patient Distribution","Background: Since December 2019, a pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has broken out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public health decision and medical resource allocation in China. We managed to forecast the infection peak time in Hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution.
Methods: We used data resource according to cases reported by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in Wuhan on subsequent days. Medical observation, discharge, infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur. Also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. Under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. 
Results: In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. We are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2/8 data. There should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. 
Conclusion: We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. Assisting critical care resources in Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023614v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023614v1.full.pdf","2020-02-19","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Gene expression signatures identify pediatric patients with multiple organ dysfunction who require advanced life support in the intensive care unit","Background: Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) occurs in the setting of a variety of pathologies including infection and trauma. Some of these patients will further decompensate and require extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a palliating maneuver to allow time for recovery of cardiopulmonary function. The molecular mechanisms driving progression from MODS to cardiopulmonary collapse remain incompletely understood, and no biomarkers have been defined to identify those MODS patients at highest risk for progression to requiring ECMO support. We hypothesize that molecular features derived from whole blood transcriptomic profiling either alone or in combination with traditional clinical and laboratory markers can prospectively identify these high risk MODS patients in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).

Design/Methods: Whole blood RNA-seq profiling was performed for 23 MODS patients at three time points during their ICU stay (at diagnosis of MODS, 72 hours after, and 8 days later), as well as four healthy controls undergoing routine sedation. Of the 23 MODS patients, six required ECMO support (ECMO patients). The predictive power of conventional demographic and clinical features was quantified for differentiating the MODS and ECMO patients. We then compared the performance of markers derived from transcriptomic profiling including (1) transcriptomically imputed leukocyte subtype distribution, (2) relevant published gene signatures and (3) a novel differential gene expression signature computed from our data set. The predictive power of our novel gene expression signature was then validated using independently published datasets. 
Results: None of the five demographic characteristics and 14 clinical features, including The Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) score, could predict deterioration of MODS to ECMO at baseline. From previously published sepsis signatures, only the signatures positively associated with patients mortality could differentiate ECMO patients from MODS patients, when applied to our transcriptomic dataset (P-value ranges from 0.01 to 0.04). Deconvolution of bulk RNA-Seq samples suggested that lower neutrophil counts were associated with increased risk of progression from MODS to ECMO (P-value = 0.03, OR=2.82 [95% CI 0.63 - 12.45]). A total of 28 genes were differentially expressed between ECMO and MODS patients at baseline (log2 fold change = 1 or = -1 with false discovery rate = 0.2). These genes are involved in protein maintenance and epigenetic-related processes. Further univariate analysis of these 28 genes suggested a signature of six DE genes associated with ECMO (OR > 3.0, P-value = 0.05). Notably, this contains a set of histone marker genes, including H1F0, HIST2H3C, HIST1H2AI, HIST1H4, and HIST1H1B, that were highly expressed in ECMO. A risk score derived from expression of these genes differentiated ECMO and MODS patients in our dataset (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-0.1.00, P-value = 7e-04) as well as validation dataset (AUC= 0.73,95% CI 0.53-0.93, P-value = 2e-02).

Conclusions: This study identified lower neutrophils and upregulation of specific histone related genes as a putative signature for deterioration of MODS to ECMO. This study demonstrates that transcriptomic features may be superior to traditional clinical methods of ascertaining severity in patients with MODS.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20022772v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20022772v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine

"A SMAD4-modulated gene profile predicts disease-free survival in stage II and III colorectal cancer","Objective: Loss of SMAD4 is associated with worse outcomes for colorectal cancer patients. We used gene ontology and bioinformatics to identify an RNA-based SMAD4-modulated profile and test its association with patient outcome.
Design: Using a discovery dataset of 250 colorectal cancer patients, we analyzed expression of BMP/Wnt target genes for association with SMAD4 expression. Promoters of the BMP/Wnt genes were interrogated for SMAD-binding elements. 15 genes were implicated and three tested for modulation by SMAD4 in patient-derived colorectal cancer tumoroids. Expression of the 15 genes was used for unsupervised hierarchical clustering of a training dataset and two resulting clusters modeled in a centroid model. This model was applied to an independent validation dataset of stage II and III patients. Disease-free survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
Results: In vitro analysis of three genes identified in the SMAD4-modulated profile (JAG1, TCF7, MYC) revealed modulation by SMAD4 consistent with the trend observed in the profile. In the training dataset (n = 553), the profile was not associated with outcome. However, among stage II and III patients (n = 461), distinct clusters were identified by unsupervised hierarchical clustering that were associated with disease-free survival (p = 0.02). The main model was applied to a validation dataset (n = 257) which confirmed the association of clustering with disease-free survival (p = 0.02).
Conclusions: A SMAD4-modulated RNA-based gene profile identified high-risk stage II and III colorectal cancer patients, can predict disease-free survival, and has prognostic potential for stage II and III colorectal cancer patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023663v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023663v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Oncology

"Estimating number of global importations of COVID-19 from Wuhan, risk of transmission outside mainland China and COVID-19 introduction index between countries outside mainland China","Background
The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date. Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China.

Methods
We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity.

Results
We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country.

Conclusions
As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024075v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024075v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2","The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak originating from Wuhan, China, poses a threat to global health. While it's evident that the virus invades respiratory tract and transmits from human to human through airway, other viral tropisms and transmission routes remain unknown. We tested viral RNA in stool from 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected hospitalized patients using rRT-PCR. 53.42% of the patients tested positive in stool. 23.29% of the patients remained positive in feces even after the viral RNA decreased to undetectable level in respiratory tract. The viral RNA was also detected in gastrointestinal tissues. Furthermore, gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelia showed positive immunofluorescent staining of viral host receptor ACE2 and viral nucleocapsid protein in a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results provide evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting its potential fecal-oral transmission route.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023721v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023721v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Clinical Characteristics and Progression of 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Patients Concurrent Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","Background: In December 2019, the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection lead to a cluster of pneumonia cases. We report the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infected patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and further investigate the treatment and the progression of the disease.
Methods: The longitudinal study included 109 patients with novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 2 and February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics, treatment, and outcomes data were collected from electronic medical records. The difference in treatment and progression between patients with ARDS and without ARDS was compared.
Results: Among 109 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43-66 years; range, 22-94 years), and 59 (54.1%) patients were men. The median hospital days were 15 days (interquartile range, 11-24 days), and 31 (28.4%) patients had died and 78 (71.6%) survived. Among them, 53 (48.6%) patients developed ARDS. Compared with non-ARDS patients, patients with ARDS were more likely to have coexisting conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular (11.3% vs. 0%) and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared with patients with mild ARDS (n = 1/19 [5.3%]), those with moderate and severe ARDS had a higher mortality rate (n = 15/24 [62.5%] for moderate ARDS and n = 10/10 [100.0%] for severe ARDS). The mortality rate increased concomitantly with the severity of ARDS. We have not observed a significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival in patients with ARDS. 
Conclusions: Our findings indicated that 2019-nCoV infected patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS had higher mortality rates and the beneficial effects of current treatments were not satisfactory, which are warranted attention from clinicians.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024166v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024166v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine

"Tracking and Predicting COVID-19 Epidemic in China Mainland","By proposing a varying coefficient Susceptible-Infected-Removal model (vSIR), we track the epidemic of COVID-19 in 30 provinces in China and 15 cities in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024257v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024257v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Epidemiology

"Estimating the case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 epidemic in China","Background: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China since late December 2019. Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic.
Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 11 Feb 2020. Competing risk model were used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR estimation was calculated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. Sensitivity analyses were performed by assuming an average period of observation stays for 3-7 days after recovery. 
Results: As of 11 Feb 2020, totally 44,653 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in mainland China. Assuming an average period of 5 days' observation stays after severe cases turned to be asymptotic, adjusted CFR of COVID-19 were 14.97% (95% CI: 14.22%-15.77%) in Hubei province, including Wuhan, the epicenter, and 0.52% (95% CI: 0.42%-0.71%) in other areas of China, respectively. We observed obvious decreasing trends of adjusted CFR for COVID-19, with two distinct turning points on January 26 and February 1 for Hubei province, and one turning point on January 28 for other areas, respectively.
Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation and recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023630v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023630v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Genetic, Cellular, and Connectomic Characterization of the Adult Human Brain Regions Commonly Plagued by Glioma","A better understanding of the nonrandom localization patterns of gliomas across the brain could lend clues to the origins of these types of tumors. We combined neuroimaging data from 335 adult patients with high- and low-grade glioma to form a replicable tumor frequency map. Using this map, we demonstrate that glioma frequency is elevated in association cortex and correlates with multiple graph-theoretical metrics of high functional connectedness. Brain regions populated with stem-like cells also exhibited a high glioma frequency. Furthermore, gliomas localized to brain regions enriched with the expression of genes associated with chromatin organization and synaptic signaling. Genetic drivers of gliomagenesis were enriched among the transcriptomic correlates of glioma distribution. Finally, a regression model incorporating connectomic, cellular, and genetic factors explained 58% of the variance in glioma frequency. This work synthesizes concepts from network neuroscience and cancer etiology to clarify the mechanisms underlying glioma distribution.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20018531v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20018531v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Neurology

"Short-term versus 6-week prednisone in the treatment of subacute thyroiditis: a randomized controlled trial","Background: Moderate-to-severe subacute thyroiditis is commonly treated with 6-8 weeks glucocorticoids; however, no studies have described short-term prednisone treatment for subacute thyroiditis. We evaluated the efficacy of this treatment for subacute thyroiditis.
Methods: This was a 24-week, prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled study. Patients aged 18-70 years with subacute thyroiditis were hospitalized from August 2013 to December 2014. Patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms were randomized to receive either 30 mg/d prednisone for 1 week and then switched to 1 week of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or 6 weeks of prednisone. The primary endpoints were the differences in efficacy at the end of treatment between two groups. Secondary endpoints included differences between the two groups in parameters of side effects at withdrawal and thyroid function at weeks 6, 12, 24.
Results: Of 96 patients screened, 52 subjects were randomized and 50 completed the study. Efficacy and recurrence rates were not significantly different at withdrawal in both groups (P=0.65). Parathyroid hormone (28.8 vs 38.9 pg/ml, p=0.011) and mean systolic blood pressure (113.9 vs 122.4 mmHg, p=0.023) were significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group at discontinuation. No significant differences were observed in other secondary endpoints at withdrawal and in thyroid function at the 6th, 12th and 24th week during the follow-up time between the two groups.
Conclusions: Fewer side effects of glucocorticoids and similar efficacy and recurrence rates were observed with short-term prednisone compared with those with 6-week treatment for subacute thyroiditis. Short-term prednisone with a better safety profile may be as one alternative strategy for ameliorating moderate-to-severe symptoms of subacute thyroiditis.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023283v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023283v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Endocrinology (including Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Disease)

"Auditory tests for characterizing hearing deficits: The BEAR test battery","Introduction: The Better hEAring Rehabilitation (BEAR) project aims to provide a new clinical profiling tool, a test battery, for hearing loss characterization. Whereas the loss of sensitivity can be efficiently measured using pure-tone audiometry, the assessment of supra-threshold hearing deficits remains a challenge. In contrast to the classical 'attenuation-distortion' model, the proposed BEAR approach is based on the hypothesis that the hearing abilities of a given listener can be characterized along two dimensions reflecting independent types of perceptual deficits (distortions). A data-driven approach provided evidence for the existence of different auditory profiles with different degrees of distortions. Design: Eleven tests were included in a test battery, based on their clinical feasibility, time efficiency and related evidence from the literature. The tests were divided into six categories: audibility, speech perception, binaural processing abilities, loudness perception, spectro-temporal modulation sensitivity and spectro-temporal resolution. Study sample: Seventy-five listeners with symmetric, mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss were selected from a clinical population. Results: The analysis of the results showed interrelations among outcomes related to high-frequency processing and outcome measures related to low-frequency processing abilities. Conclusions: The results showed the ability of the tests to reveal differences among individuals and their potential use in clinical settings.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20021949v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20021949v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Otolaryngology

"Expression profiles of circRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs in extreme phenotypes of diabetic retinopathy","Recent evidences highlighted regulatory role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the development of diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, the literatures and number of the RNAs identified were limited. Here, we compared the expression profiles of circRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs in the blood of the susceptible individuals who developed severe DR within 5 years after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM), and the inherently resistant individuals who are spared from DR despite over 20-year history of T2DM. Using RNA microarray, hundreds of significantly differently expressed circRNAs, lncRNAs, and dozens of mRNAs were identified. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction verified the above findings. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the differentially expressed circRNAs were involved in platelet-derived growth factor binding, and mRNA and the cis-target genes of lncRNA participate in negative regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis suggested that the differentially expressed circRNAs were related to vitamin B6 metabolism and type 2 diabetes. The cis-target genes of lncRNAs are enriched in valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis and in the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling pathway. The trans-target genes of lncRNAs are enriched in pathways such as vitamin B6 metabolism. Differentially expressed mRNAs are associated with type 2 diabetes and the vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate that circRNAs and lncRNAs may be involved in the regulation of DR and lay a foundation for further researches into the underlying mechanisms.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023481v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023481v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Ophthalmology

"Application of n-of-1 clinical trials in personalized nutrition research: a trial protocol for Westlake N-of-1 Trials for Macronutrient Intake (WE-MACNUTR)","Abstract
IMPORTANCE Diet and nutrition play essential roles in human health. Personalized dietary recommendations or nutritional advice tailored to each individual can help with more effective disease prevention. N-of-1 trials can provide a pragmatic clinical means of addressing individual postprandial blood glucose variation in response to different food ingredients or nutrients. 
OBJECTIVE To investigate the individual postprandial glucose response to diets with diverse macronutrient proportions at both individual level and population level and the potential of the novel single-patient (n-of-1) trial for the personalization of diet.
DESIGN Westlake N-of-1 Trials for Macronutrient Intake (WE-MACNUTR) is a multiple crossover feeding trial. Individual response to different dietary patterns in terms of postprandial glucose response is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include individual phenotypic response and the effects of dietary ingredients on the composition and structure of gut microbiota. 
SETTING Participants experience three successive 12-day dietary intervention pairs including a 6-day wash-out period before each isocaloric dietary intervention. Two different type of diets (a 6-day high-fat, low-carbohydrate (HF-LC) diet and a 6-day low-fat, high-carbohydrate (LF-HC) diet) are assigned to an individual in a randomized sequence using block randomization with a fixed block size of two. This feeding trial takes place in Hangzhou, China.
PARTICIPANTS Target enrolment is 30 healthy individuals aged between 18 and 65 years. Exclusion criteria are inability or unwillingness to approved informed consent; other serious medical conditions; food allergy; and no access to a smart phone or computer with an internet connection. 
DISCUSSION This trial addresses the feasibility of n-of-1 approach for personalizing dietary intervention to individuals. The results will help provide personalized dietary recommendation on macronutrients in terms of postprandial blood glucose response. Well-designed n-of-1 trial is likely to become an effective method of optimizing individual health and advancing health care.

Methods and Results: A total of 204 consecutive severe aortic stenosis patients who underwent TAVR were enrolled. 83 (40.7%) patients were BAV patients and the other 121 patients were tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) patients. All patients received diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) at baseline, 2 to 7 days after TAVR. Mean ages (mean  SD: 75.8  6.7 years vs. 78.9  6.6 years, p = 0.004) and STS scores (6.0  3.7 vs. 7.1  4.2, p = 0.044) of the BAV and TAV patients were significantly different, while the stroke rates (2.4% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.704) were comparable between two groups. BAV patients were associated with higher number of new lesions (5.69  6.22 vs. 3.50  4.16, p = 0.008), total lesion volume [median(interquartile range): 290(70-930) mm3 vs. 140(35-480) mm3, p = 0.008], and the volume per lesion [70.0(45.0-115.0) mm3 vs. 57.5(24.5-93.0) mm3, p = 0.037] in DW-MRI. Moreover, the proportion of patients with lesions larger than 1cm3 (28.6% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.005) and the number of new lesions in the middle cerebral arteries zone (1.46  2.07 vs. 0.98  1.84, p = 0.039) and intermediate zone between the anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries (ACA/MCA) (1.07  1.68 vs. 0.50  1.05, p = 0.007), and between the vertebral artery and basilar artery (VA/BA) (1.01  1.35 vs. 0.77  1.44, p = 0.033) were higher in BAV patients than in TAV patients.
Conclusions: BAV patients may encounter more severe brain injuries not only due to greater number of lesions but also due to larger lesion size, especially in the ACA/MCA, MCA and VA/BA lesions zone.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20023184v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20023184v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Kidney impairment is associated with in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients","Background: Information on kidney impairment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. This study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan.
Method: We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed.
Results: We included 710 consecutive COVID19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count.
Conclusion: The prevalence of kidney impairment (hematuria, proteinuria and kidney dysfunction) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high. After adjustment for confounders, kidney impairment indicators were associated with higher risk of in-hospital death. Clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney impairment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20023242v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20023242v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Nephrology

"Refractive errors, ocular biometry and diabetic retinopathy: a systematic review","ABSTRACT
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of visual impairment and blindness worldwide. The onset and progression of DR are influenced by systemic factors such as hyperglycemia and hypertension as well as ocular parameters. A better knowledge of the risk factors for DR is vital to improving the outcome of patients with DR and risk stratification. More recently, there has been increasing focus on the influence of myopia on DR development. Some observational studies have reported myopia being a protective factor for the development of DR, however the findings were inconsistent. In addition, it remains unclear whether it was myopia, axial length (AL), or other refractive factors that play the protective role. The protective mechanism against DR may be related to ocular elongation, posterior vitreous detachment, low perfusion in the retina and the abnormal cytokine profile. This systematic review will summarize the association of DR with refractory status as well as different refractive components including anterior chamber depth, refractory power of the lens, AL, and axial length-to-corneal radius ratio.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024000v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024000v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Ophthalmology

"Molecular malaria surveillance using a novel protocol for extraction and analysis of nucleic acids retained on used rapid diagnostic tests","The use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) as a source for nucleic acids that can be analyzed via nucleic acid amplification techniques has several advantages, including minimal amounts of blood, sample collection, simplified storage and shipping conditions at room temperature. We have systematically developed and extensively evaluated a procedure to extract total nucleic acids from used malaria RDTs. The co-extraction of DNA and RNA molecules from small volumes of dried blood retained on the RDTs allows detection and quantification of P. falciparum parasites from asymptomatic patients with parasite densities as low as 1 Pf/L blood using reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Based on the extraction protocol we have developed the ENAR (Extraction of Nucleic Acids from RDTs) approach; a complete workflow for large-scale molecular malaria surveillance. Using RDTs collected during a malaria indicator survey we demonstrated that ENAR provides a powerful tool to analyze nucleic acids from thousands of RDTs in a standardized and high-throughput manner. We found several, known and new, non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the propeller region of the kelch 13 gene among isolates circulating on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023960v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023960v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Epidemiology

"Epidemiology and preclinical management of dog bites among humans in Wakiso and Kampala districts, Uganda: Implications for prevention of dog bites and rabies.","In rabies endemic areas, appropriate management of dog bites is critical in human rabies prevention. Victims must wash bite wounds for 15 minutes with soap, water and disinfectant immediately before seeking medical care. This study investigated the epidemiology of dog bites and determinants of compliance to these preclinical guidelines requirements among dog bite victims from high rabies-burden areas of Wakiso and Kampala, Uganda. An explanatory sequential mixed-methods study design was used. Quantitative data were collected from 376 dog-bite patients at two healthcare facilities. Qualitative data as also collected through 13 in-depth interviews with patients, healthcare workers, herbalists and veterinarians. Qualitative data were analyzed using a deductive thematic approach. Generalized lineal models were used to determine factors associated with compliance.  Nearly half (190, 51%) of the patients were from Wakiso District and 293 (77.9%) had grade II wounds. Most of the wounds (171, 45.5%) were on the legs. Two thirds of the bites occurred in public places. Only 70 (19%) of the bite patients had complied with preclinical guidelines. Nearly half of the patients had applied unrecommended substances such as herbs (47/193), antiseptics (46/193), black stone (25/193) and unknown creams (10/193) on the wounds. Factors negatively associated with compliance included: being aged 15 years or older, adjPR = 0.70 (0.47,0.92) and knowing the dog owner, adjPR=0.65 (0.36,0.93). However, attainment of secondary or higher education, adjPR= 1.76 (1.24,3.79), being in employment, adjPR = 1.48 (1.09,2.31), perception that the dog was sick, adjPR = 1.47 (1.02,2.72) and knowledge about the subsequent victim(s) of the dog adjPR=0.35 (0.17,0.70) were positively associated with compliance. High occurrence of dog bites in public places by free-roaming dogs suggests the need for promotion of responsible dog ownership. Additionally, targeted health education may be required to improve the low compliance to preclinical guidelines.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023556v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023556v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Epidemiology

"Genome-wide association study implicates novel loci and reveals candidate effector genes for longitudinal pediatric bone accrual through variant-to-gene mapping","Bone accrual impacts lifelong skeletal health, but genetic discovery has been hampered by cross-sectional study designs and uncertainty about target effector genes. Here, we captured this dynamic phenotype by modeling longitudinal bone accrual across 11,000 bone scans followed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We revealed 40 loci (35 novel), half residing in topological associated domains harboring known bone genes. Several of these loci also associated with fracture risk later in life. Variant-to-gene mapping identified contacts between GWAS loci and nearby gene promoters, and siRNA knockdown of gene expression clarified the putative effector gene at three specific loci in two osteoblast cell models. The resulting target genes highlight the cell fate decision between osteogenic and adipogenic lineages as important in normal bone accrual.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024133v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024133v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Fractal kinetics of COVID-19 pandemic","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to grow rapidly in China and is spreading in other parts of the world. The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease.  However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models.  Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic.  We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023820v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023820v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Epidemiology

"A quantitative framework to define the end of an outbreak: application to Ebola Virus Disease","Declaring the end of an outbreak is an important step in controlling infectious disease outbreaks. An objective estimation of the probability of cases arising in the future is important to reduce the risk of post-declaration flare-ups. We developed a simulation-based model to quantify that probability. We tested it on simulated Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) data and found this probability was most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the delay between symptom onset and recovery or death of the last detected case. For EVD, our results suggest that the current WHO criterion of 42 days since the outcome of the last detected case is too short and very sensitive to underreporting. The 90 days of enhanced surveillance period after the end-of-outbreak declaration is therefore crucial to capture potential flare-ups of cases. Hence, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This should be followed by a 90-day enhanced surveillance, after which the official end-of-outbreak can be declared. This corresponds to less than 5% probability of flare ups in most of the scenarios examined. Our quantitative framework could be adapted to define end-of-outbreak criteria for other infectious diseases.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024042v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024042v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Epidemiology

"The Epidemiology of Plasmodium vivax Among Adults in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: A Nationally-Representative, Cross-Sectional Survey","Background
Reports of P. vivax infections among Duffy-negative hosts have begun to accumulate throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this growing body of evidence, no nationally representative epidemiological surveys of P. vivax in sub-Saharan Africa nor population genetic analyses to determine the source of these infections have been performed.

Methods
To overcome this critical gap in knowledge, we screened nearly 18,000 adults in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for P. vivax using samples from the 2013-2014 Demographic Health Survey. Infections were identified by quantitative PCR and confirmed with nested-PCR. P. vivax mitochondrial genomes were constructed after short-read sequencing. Risk factors, spatial distributions and population genetic analyses were explored.

Findings
Overall, we found a 2.96% (95% CI: 2.28%, 3.65%) prevalence of P. vivax infections across the DRC. Nearly all infections were among Duffy negative adults (486/489). Infections were not associated with typical malaria risk-factors and demonstrated small-scale heterogeneity in prevalence across space. Mitochondrial genomes suggested that DRC P. vivax is an older clade that shares its most recent common ancestor with South American isolates.

Interpretation
P. vivax is more prevalent across the DRC than previously believed despite widespread Duffy-negativity. Comparison to global and historical P. vivax sequences suggests that historic DRC P. vivax may have been transported to the New World on the wave of European expansion. Our findings suggest congolese P. vivax is an innocuous threat given its relatively flat distribution across space, lack of malaria risk factors, and potentially

"Leading causes of mortality and prescription drug coverage in Canada and New Zealand","Background: Canada may soon see the introduction of a national pharmaceutical insurance system. New Zealand has a government-funded healthcare system used by all residents that operates within a tight cost-containment budget. 
Objective: To compare the main mortality causes in Canada and New Zealand and examine listings in current Canadian provincial public drug plans and the New Zealand national drug formulary. 
Methods: Age-standardized mortality rates from 1985 to 2014 and data on hospital discharges and average length of stay in hospital for Canada and New Zealand were obtained from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's website. Information on insured medications was obtained from Canadian provincial drug plan lists and the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Schedule current in mid-2019. 
Results: Mortality rates for acute myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were higher, on average over the 30-year observation period, in New Zealand, but rates for malignancies and respiratory disorders were similar in the two countries. Reimbursement listing rates for drugs for cancer and some cardiovascular indications were lower in New Zealand than in Canada. 
Conclusions: New Zealand's drug coverage system has contained costs, but it restricts or denies access to new innovative medicines with the potential to improve patients' lives. Although a New Zealand-style national pharmacare scheme in Canada would offer the opportunity to restrain drug expenditure, it would likely fail to satisfy patients and healthcare providers and diminish health outcomes, resulting in higher costs in other healthcare sectors.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024232v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024232v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Health Policy

"Reduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","BACKGROUND The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed great threat to human health, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the WHO. T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear.
METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases. 
RESULTS The number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients (=60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+T cells or CD4+T cells lower than 800/L, 300/L, or 400/L, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. 
CONCLUSIONS T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients, with total T cells, CD8+T cells CD4+T cells counts lower than 800/L, 300/L, and 400/L, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents  = 2.1  0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024414v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024414v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Epidemiology

"Psychological responses, behavioral changes and public perceptions during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a population based cross-sectional survey","Objective: To investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infections and their associations with public perceptions in China 
Design: Cross sectional population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing between 1 and 10 February, 2020
Setting: Wuhan (the epicentre and quarantined city), and Shanghai (a typical major city with close transportation link with Wuhan)
Participants: Random sample of 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai aged above 18
Main outcome measures: Anxiety (measured by the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder [GAD-7] scale), recommended and avoidance behaviors (engaged in all six behaviors such as increasing surface cleaning and reducing going out).
Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score =10 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p<0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7). The strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1-1.4), followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0-1.3).  
Conclusions: Psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information to address the high anxiety level.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024448v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024448v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Estimating maximal oxygen consumption from heart rate response to submaximal ramped treadmill test","The Cambridge Ramped Treadmill Test (CRTT) is an incremental, multistage exercise test (I: steady-state walk, II: walk ramped speed, III: walk ramped incline, and IV: run ramped speed on flat). It is typically deployed as a submaximal test with flexible test termination criteria, making it an attractive option for population-based studies of cardiorespiratory fitness. We conducted a study in healthy adults to test the validity of maximal oxygen consumption estimates (VO2max; ml O2  kg-1  min-1) predicted from CRTT heart rate response using several methods: a heart rate-to-work rate linear regression method across several test termination criteria, either when a percentage of age-predicted maximal heart rate was achieved (50% through 100%) or at the end of distinct CRTT stages (II, III, and IV); and two single-point walk-test calibration methods using data from either CRTT stage I (low-point method) or stage II (high-point method). For estimates from the linear regression method, prediction bias ranged from -3.0 to -1.6 ml O2  kg-1  min-1 and Pearson's r ranged from 0.57 to 0.79 for endpoints at percentages of age-predicted maximal heart rate; results were similar for stages III and IV endpoints, but predictions using data only up to stage II had poorer agreement. Agreement was moderate when using the low-point (mean bias: -4.3ml O2  kg-1  min-1; Pearson's r: 0.71) and high-point (mean bias: -3.5 ml O2  kg-1  min-1; Pearson's r: 0.69) methods.

"Estimation of the epidemic properties of the 2019 novel coronavirus: A mathematical modeling study","Background
The 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has been spreading rapidly in China. Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic.

Methods
We conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19.

Findings
Before the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility.

Interpretation
COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024315v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024315v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Views about integrating smoking cessation treatment within psychological services for patients with common mental illness: a multi-perspective qualitative study","Background: Smoking rates are significantly higher in people with mental health problems, compared to those without. Negative attitudes towards smoking cessation are widespread in inpatient settings towards patients with severe and enduring mental illness. It is not clear if the same attitudes operate in psychological services towards people with common mental illness. We aimed to understand the concerns and views that patients, therapists, and smoking cessation practitioners may have about integrating smoking cessation treatment into psychological treatment for common mental illness and how these concerns may be overcome.

Methods: Thematic analysis of 23 in-depth interviews. Interviews took place in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) and smoking cessation services in England. Participants were 11 psychological wellbeing practitioners (PWPs), six IAPT patients with common mental illness, and six smoking cessation advisors. 

Findings: IAPT patients reported psychological benefits from smoking, but also described smoking as a form of therapeutic self-harm. PWPs seem positive towards smoking cessation treatment for people with common mental illness. IAPT PWPs and patients accept evidence that smoking tobacco may harm mental health, and quitting might benefit mental health. PWPs report expertise in helping people with common mental illness to make behavioural changes in the face of mood disturbances and poor motivation. IAPT appears to be a natural environment for smoking cessation intervention. PWPs felt confident to offer smoking cessation treatments to IAPT patients, but thought that a reduction in caseload was required to deliver smoking cessation support in an already pressed service.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024596v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024596v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Association of Population Migration and Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic Control","Background and Objective To analyze the impact of different patterns of migration flow in two cities, Hefei and Shenzhen, on the epidemic and disease control of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), in order to provide insight for making differentiated controlling policies.
Methods We collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hefei and Shenzhen between January 19 and February 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed.
Results A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.415.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.1517.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217).
Conclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024661v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024661v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Epidemiology

"Is migraine associated to brain anatomical alterations? New data and an ALE meta-analysis.","A growing number of studies investigate brain anatomy in migraine using voxel- (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM), as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The purpose of this article is to identify consistent patterns of anatomical alterations associated with migraine. First, 19 migraineurs without aura and 19 healthy participants were included in a brain imaging study. T1-weighted MRIs and DTI sequences were acquired and analyzed using VBM, SBM and tract-based spatial statistics. No significant alterations of gray matter (GM) volume, cortical thickness, cortical gyrification, sulcus depth and white-matter tract integrity could be observed. However, migraineurs displayed decreased white matter (WM) volume in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Second, a systematic review of the literature employing VBM, SBM and DTI was conducted to investigate brain anatomy in migraine. Meta-analysis was performed using Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) on GM volume data. Alterations of GM volume, WM volume, cortical thickness or white-matter tract integrity were reported in 72%, 50%, 56% and 33% of published studies respectively. Spatial distribution and direction of the disclosed effects were highly inconsistent across studies. The ALE analysis revealed no significant decrease of GM volume in migraine.

"Return to play after treating acute muscle injuries in elite football players with a multimodal therapy approach that includes a specific protocol of (almost) daily radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy","Aim: To compare lay-off times achieved by treating acute muscle injuries in elite football players with a multimodal therapy approach that includes a specific protocol of almost daily radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT)) with corresponding data reported in the literature.

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of treatments and recovery times of muscle injuries suffered by the players of an elite football team competing in the first/second German Bundesliga during one of the previous seasons.

Results: A total of 20 acute muscle injuries were investigated in the aforementioned season, of which eight (40%) were diagnosed as type 1a/muscular tightness injuries, five (25%) as type 2b/muscle strain injuries, four (20%) as type 3a/partial muscle tear injuries and three (15%) as contusions. All injuries were treated with the previously mentioned multimodal therapy approach. Compared with data reported by Ekstrand et al. (Br J Sports Med 2013;47:769-774), lay-off times (median / mean) were shortened by 54% and 58% respectively in the case of type 1a injuries, by 50% and 55% respectively in the case of type 2b injuries as well as by 8% and 21% respectively in the case of type 3a injuries. No adverse reactions were observed.

Conclusions: Overall, the multimodal therapy approach investigated in this study is a safe and effective treatment approach for treating type 1a and 2b acute muscle injuries amongst elite football players and may help to prevent more severe, structural muscle injuries.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024653v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024653v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Sports Medicine

"Is glycaemia associated with poorer brain health and risk of dementia? Cross sectional and follow-up analysis of the UK Biobank","Objective: To understand the relationship across the glycaemic spectrum with incident dementia, brain structure, and cognitive decline.
Research Design and Methods: UK Biobank participants, aged 40-69 at recruitment. HbA1c and diabetes diagnosis define baseline glycaemic categories. Outcomes included incident vascular dementia (VD), Alzheimers dementia (AD), hippocampal volume (HV), white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, cognitive function and decline. All results are in reference to normoglycaemic individuals (HbA1c 35-<42 mmol/mol). 
Results: 210433 (47%), 15246 (3%), 3280 (0.7%), 20793 (5%) individuals had low HbA1c, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and known diabetes, respectively.  Pre- and known diabetes markedly increased incident VD, (hazard ratios (HR) 1.51, 95%CI=1.01;2.25 and 1.96, 95%CI=1.49;2.58, respectively), less so AD (1.18, 0.92;1.52 and 1.13 0.95,1.33), adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic variables. For VD, multivariate adjustment, driven by antihypertensives, attenuated associations, HR 1.27, 0.84;1.91 and 1.45,1.07;1.97. Pre- and known diabetes conferred elevated risks of cognitive decline (odds ratio OR 1.53, 1.02;2.29 and 1.49, 1.02;2.18, respectively). People with pre-diabetes, undiagnosed and known diabetes had higher WMH volumes (4%, 30%, 3%, respectively), and lower HV (34.51 mm3, 11.73 mm3 and 61.13 mm3 respectively). People with low-normal HbA1c (<35 mmol/mol) had 5% lower WMH volume and 13.6 mm3 greater HV than normoglycaemic individuals.  
Conclusions: Pre and known diabetes increase VD risks, less so AD.  Excess VD risks were largely accounted for by treated hypertension. Hyperglycaemic states were associated with adverse, whereas low normal HbA1c was associated with favourable brain structure compared to normoglycaemic individuals. Our findings have implications for cardiovascular medication in hyperglycaemia for brain health.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024471v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024471v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Epidemiology

"A novel cortical biomarker signature for predicting pain sensitivity: protocol for the PREDICT longitudinal analytical validation study","Introduction: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a common musculoskeletal pain condition with development of chronic symptoms in 49% of patients. Although a number of biological factors have shown an association with chronic TMD in cross-sectional and case control studies, there are currently no biomarkers that can predict the development of chronic symptoms. The PREDICT study aims to undertake analytical validation of a novel peak alpha frequency (PAF) and corticomotor excitability (CME) biomarker signature using a human model of the transition to sustained myofascial temporomandibular pain (masseter intramuscular injection of nerve growth factor [NGF]). This paper describes, a-priori, the methods and analysis plan.
Methods and analysis: This study uses a multi-site longitudinal, experimental study to follow individuals for a period of 30 days as they progressively develop and experience complete resolution of NGF-induced muscle pain. 150 healthy participants will be recruited. Participants will complete twice daily electronic pain dairies from Day 0 to Day 30 and undergo assessment of pressure pain thresholds, and recording of PAF and CME on Days 0, 2 and 5. Intramuscular injection of NGF will be given into the right masseter muscle on Days 0 and 2. The primary outcome is pain sensitivity.
Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval has been obtained from The University of New South Wales (HC190206) and the University of Maryland Baltimore (HP-00085371). Dissemination will occur through presentations at National and International conferences and publications in international peer-reviewed journals.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024695v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024695v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Pain Medicine

"Geometric Semi-automatic Analysis of Colles' Fractures","Fractures of the wrist are common in Emergency Departments, where some patients are treated with a procedure called Manipulation under Anaesthesia. In some cases this procedure is unsuccessful and patients need to visit the hospital again where they undergo surgery to treat the fracture. This work describes a geometric semi-automatic image analysis algorithm to analyse and compare the x-rays of healthy controls and patients with dorsally displaced wrist fractures (Colles' fractures) who were treated with Manipulation under Anaesthesia. A series of 161 posterior-anterior radiographs from healthy controls and patients with Colles' fractures were acquired and analysed. The patients' group was further subdivided according to the outcome of the procedure (successful/unsuccessful) and pre- or post-intervention creating five groups in total (healthy, pre-successful, pre-unsuccessful, post-successful, post-unsuccessful). The semi-automatic analysis consisted of manual location of three landmarks (finger, lunate and radial styloid) and automatic processing to generate 32 geometric and texture measurements, which may be related to conditions such as osteoporosis and swelling of the wrist. Statistical differences were found between patients and controls and pre- and post-intervention, but not between the procedures. The most distinct measurements were those of texture. Although the study includes a relatively low number of cases and measurements, the statistical differences are encouraging.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024562v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024562v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Radiology and Imaging

"A factorial Mendelian randomization study to systematically prioritize genetic targets for the treatment of cardiovascular disease","Abstract 
Importance New drugs which provide benefit alongside statin mono-therapy are warranted to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease.
Objective To systematically evaluate the genetically predicted effects of 8,851 genes and cardiovascular disease risk factors using data from the UK Biobank and subsequently prioritize their potential to reduce cardiovascular disease in addition to statin therapy.
Design, Setting, and Participants A factorial Mendelian randomization study using individual level data from the UK Biobank study. This population-based cohort includes a total of 502,602 individuals aged between 40 and 96 years old at baseline who were recruited between 2006 to 2010.
Exposures Genetic variants robustly associated with the expression of target genes in whole blood (based on P<5x10-08) were used to construct gene scores using findings from the eQTLGen consortium (n=31,684).
Main Outcomes and Measures Genetically predicted effects for each of the 8,851 genes were firstly evaluated with 5 measured outcomes from the UK Biobank in turn (body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides). Effects surviving multiple comparisons from this initial analysis were subsequently analyzed using factorial Mendelian randomization to evaluate evidence of an additive beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease risk compared to a HMGCR genetic score acting as a proxy for statin inhibition. Finally, a phenome-wide analysis was undertaken to evaluate predicted effects between prioritized targets and 570 outcomes in the UK Biobank to highlight potential adverse side-effects.
Results 377 genetically predicted effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors were identified by Mendelian randomization (based on P<1.13x10-6). Of the 68 druggable genes, 20 candidate genes were predicted to lower cardiovascular disease risk in combination with statin treatment (P<7.35x10-4). Genes such as FDFT1 were predicted to have added benefit with statin therapy (OR=0.93; 95% CI, 0.91-0.95; P=2.21x10-10) but are unlikely to make safe targets due to their predicted effects on adverse side effects. In contrast, PRKCE provided evidence of a putative added benefit in combination with statins (OR=0.94; CI, 0.91-0.96; P=1.72x10-9) with no predicted adverse effects.
Conclusions and Relevance Through the application of a systematic factorial Mendelian randomization analysis, we have prioritized (and deprioritized) potential drug targets predicted to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in addition to statin therapy.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023010v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023010v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Characteristics and Impact of Librarian Co-authored Systematic Reviews: A Bibliometric Analysis","Background:  Health sciences libraries have been providing services that support systematic reviews (SRs) for many years. In recent times the problem facing health sciences libraries is the management of the demand versus resources availability. There have been questions posed as to the value of this type of service in health sciences libraries. A valuable outcome of librarian collaboration on SR teams is co-authorship of the reported SRs. This study aimed to examine the characteristics and impact of librarian co-authored SRs. 
Methods:  A bibliometric analysis was conducted. Librarian co-authored SRs were identified in the Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection limited up to the year 2017. Librarian co-authored SRs with the librarian as first author were excluded from this analysis. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied in the selection process. The included records were analyzed using Perl programs and VOSviewer. To examine the dissemination of librarian co-authored SRs, citing articles to the included SR records were retrieved from the WOS Core Collection and then identified in MEDLINE for an analysis of the indexed publication types. 
Results:  The included results yielded 1,711 librarian co-authored SRs published between 1996 and 2017. The top three countries of the first author affiliation were USA, Canada, and Netherlands.  Sources of publication were distributed among 730 journal titles.  The number of MEDLINE citing articles to the included SRs was 28,868. The mean number of citations to a SR was 26.4.  The top publication type descriptor of the citing articles representing the MEDLINE Study Characteristic category was Randomized Controlled Trial. 
Conclusion:  Outcomes of librarian contributions to supporting SRs include increasing scholarship opportunities that highlight librarian contributions to other disciplines.  SRs are bodies of evidence, which can influence policy, patient care, and future research. In this study, we demonstrate that librarian co-authored SRs are disseminated into randomized controlled trials and other study types, meta-analyses, as well as guidelines, thus providing insight into knowledge transfer and the potential for clinical implementation.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023119v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023119v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20","Epidemiology

"Estimating the cure rate and case fatality rate of the ongoing epidemic COVID-19","The epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus COVID-19 in Wuhan at the end of 2019 has become an urgent public event of worldwide concern. However, due to the changing data of the epidemic, there is no scientific estimate of the cure rate and case fatality rate of the epidemic. This study proposes a method to estimate the cure rate and case fatality rate of COVID-19. The ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate. Moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. After simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. When j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. This method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024513v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024513v1.full.pdf","2020-02-20",NA,"Diao","/highwire/citation/72339/bibtext",40,"210220-40","21-02-2020","72339"
"Leading causes of mortality and prescription drug coverage in Canada and New Zealand","Background: Canada may soon see the introduction of a national pharmaceutical insurance system. New Zealand has a government-funded healthcare system used by all residents that operates within a tight cost-containment budget. 
Objective: To compare the main mortality causes in Canada and New Zealand and examine listings in current Canadian provincial public drug plans and the New Zealand national drug formulary. 
Methods: Age-standardized mortality rates from 1985 to 2014 and data on hospital discharges and average length of stay in hospital for Canada and New Zealand were obtained from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's website. Information on insured medications was obtained from Canadian provincial drug plan lists and the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Schedule current in mid-2019. 
Results: Mortality rates for acute myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were higher, on average over the 30-year observation period, in New Zealand, but rates for malignancies and respiratory disorders were similar in the two countries. Reimbursement listing rates for drugs for cancer and some cardiovascular indications were lower in New Zealand than in Canada. 
Conclusions: New Zealand's drug coverage system has contained costs, but it restricts or denies access to new innovative medicines with the potential to improve patients' lives. Although a New Zealand-style national pharmacare scheme in Canada would offer the opportunity to restrain drug expenditure, it would likely fail to satisfy patients and healthcare providers and diminish health outcomes, resulting in higher costs in other healthcare sectors.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024232v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024232v2.full.pdf","2020-02-20",NA,"Rawson","/highwire/citation/72340/bibtext",41,"210220-41","21-02-2020","72340"
"The reproductive number R0 of COVID-19 based on estimate of a statistical time delay dynamical system","In this paper, we estimate the reproductive number R0 of COVID-19 based on Wallinga and Lipsitch framework {11} and a novel statistical time delay dynamic system. We use the observed data reported in CCDC's paper to estimate distribution of the generation interval of the infection and apply  the simulation results from the time delay dynamic system as well as released data from CCDC  to fit the growth rate. The conclusion is: Based our Fudan-CCDC model, the growth rate r of COVID-19 is almost in [0.30, 0.32] which is  larger than  the growth rate 0.1  estimated by CCDC {9},   and the  reproductive number R0 of COVID-19 is estimated by 3.25= R0 =3.4 if we simply use R=1+r*Tc with Tc=7.5, which is bigger than that of SARS.

"Evaluating new evidence in the early dynamics of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China with real time domestic traffic and potential asymptomatic transmissions","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to 28 countries/regions with over 43,000 confirmed cases. Much about this outbreak is still unknown. At this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate alternative sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. With updated real time domestic traffic, this study aims to integrate recent evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 to infer the dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced. The estimated case confirmation rate has been low but has increased steadily to 23.37% on average. The findings of this study depend on the validity of the underlying assumptions, and continuing work is needed, especially in monitoring the current infection status of Wuhan residents.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023440v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023440v2.full.pdf","2020-02-20",NA,"Zhou","/highwire/citation/72345/bibtext",44,"210220-44","21-02-2020","72345"
"Simulating and Forecasting the Cumulative Confirmed Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in China by Boltzmann Function-based Regression Analyses","An ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is hitting Wuhan City and has spread to other provinces/cities of China and overseas. It very urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann-function based regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well fitted with the Boltzmann function (R2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) will become minimal between Feb 28 and Mar 10, 2020, with 95% CI. In addition, we found that the data of cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and Worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. To our knowledge this is the first study revealing that the Boltzmann function is suitable to simulate epidemics. The estimated potential total number of confirmed cases and key dates for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak may provide certain guidance for governments, organizations and citizens to optimize preparedness and response efforts.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564v2.full.pdf","2020-02-20",NA,"Fu","/highwire/citation/72346/bibtext",45,"210220-45","21-02-2020","72346"
"Facemask shortage and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Reflection on public health measures","To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the facemask shortage during the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak in China. We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies in China could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of April. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20020735v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20020735v2.full.pdf","2020-02-20",NA,"Wu","/highwire/citation/72347/bibtext",46,"210220-46","21-02-2020","72347"
"Assessing the Tendency of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) Outbreak in China","Since December 1, 2019, the spread of COVID-19 is increasing every day. It is particularly important to predict the trend of the epidemic for the timely adjustment of the economy and industries. We proposed a Flow-SEHIR model in this paper to perform the trends of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) in China.  
The results show that the number of daily confirmed new cases reaches the inflection point on Feb. 6-10 outside Hubei. For the maximum of temporal infected cases number, the predicted peak value in China except Hubei was estimated to be 21721 (95% CI: 18764-24929). The peak arrival time is on March 3-9. The temporal number of patients in most areas of China outside Hubei will peak from March 12 to March 15. The peak values of more than 73.5% provinces or regions in China will be controlled within 1000. According to Flow-SEHIR model and estimations from the data of evacuation of nationals from Wuhan, the real peak cumulative number of patients in Hubei is estimated to be 403481 (95% CI: 143284-1166936).","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021444v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021444v3.full.pdf","2020-02-20",NA,"Liu","/highwire/citation/72348/bibtext",47,"210220-47","21-02-2020","72348"
"Genetic, Cellular, and Connectomic Characterization of the Adult Human Brain Regions Commonly Plagued by Glioma","Introduction: For decades it has been known that gliomas follow a non-random spatial distribution, appearing more often in some brain regions (e.g. the insula) than others (e.g. the occipital lobe). A better understanding of the localization patterns of glioma could lend clues to the origins of these types of brain tumors. Following hypotheses derived from prior research into neuropsychiatric disease and cancer, gliomas may be expected to localize to functional hub regions of the brain, regions populated by stem-like cells, and regions enriched with transcription of genetic determinants of glioma. 

Methods: A tumor frequency map was derived using MRI data from 335 adult patients with high- and low-grade glioma accessed from the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS). First, the connectomic correlates of this map were explored by comparing distributions of tumor frequency across canonical subnetworks and regions of high functional connectivity and centrality. Second, glioma frequency across brain regions known to contain sources of neural stem cells (i.e. the hippocampus and the caudate) was compared to glioma frequency across random sets of parcels. Post-mortem microarray data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) was used to estimate oligodendrocyte precursor cell distribution across the brain, and the spatial correspondence of this measure with tumor frequency was tested. Third, AHBA data was also used for a partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis relating spatial transcription patterns of 20647 genes to glioma distribution. The resulting ranked lists of genes related to glioma distribution were tested for enrichment of an a priori set of genes thought to drive gliomagenesis. Finally, we constructed a multiple linear regression model combining all of the significant factors across the study into one model predicting glioma distribution.

Results: Glioma frequency was elevated in association cortex and positively correlated with measures of functional hubness. Regions of the brain populated with stem-like cells, such as neural stem cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, exhibited a high glioma frequency. PLS regression relating gene expression patterns to glioma frequency determined two components (PLS1 and PLS2) that respectively explained 19% and 18% of the variance in glioma distribution. PLS1 was enriched with genes most strongly associated with chromatin organization, whereas PLS2 was related to synaptic signaling along with a broad set of metabolic processes. Interestingly, PLS1 was enriched with an a priori set of glioma proto-oncogenes. A multiple linear regression model incorporating the topological, cellular, and genetic contributions to tumor frequency was able to explain 58% of the variance in glioma distribution about the brain and revealed that each of these factors were independent predictors of tumor frequency.

Conclusion: Glioma distribution can in part be explained by functional hubness, distributions of stem-like cells, and transcription patterns of genetic determinants of glioma. These results add to previous literature reporting the vulnerability of hub regions to neurological disease and provide support for cancer stem cell theories of glioma. Our findings illustrate how factors of diverse scale, from genetic to connectomic, can independently influence the anatomic localization of oncogenesis.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20018531v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20018531v2.full.pdf","2020-02-20",NA,"Mandal","/highwire/citation/72351/bibtext",48,"210220-48","21-02-2020","72351"
"Psychiatric symptoms and syndromes transcending diagnostic boundaries in Indian multiplex families: The cohort of the Accelerator program for Discovery in Brain disorders using Stem cells (ADBS)","Accelerator program for discovery in brain disorders using stem cells (ADBS) is an ongoing longitudinal study investigating the neurobiological aspects of five psychiatric disorders (Alzheimers dementia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder or schizophrenia) in India. The study uses several techniques (brain-imaging, psychophysics, neuropsychology, next-generation sequencing, cellular models), and in-depth clinical assessments in a longitudinal cohort from multiple-affected families. This article explores the frequency of manifestations of different psychiatric symptoms and syndromes in the participants and their relatives from the first wave of this study (August 2016 to October 2019). We screened 3,583 families and enrolled 481 families (1406 participants; 773 affected with any of the 5 disorders, and 633 relatives). The participants had a high familial prevalence with nearly a third of FDRs affected. Though similar disorders aggregated, the majority (61%) of the families had dissimilar diagnoses among members. Moreover, 15% of affected participants had two or more co-occurring syndromes. Diverse cross-cutting symptoms, unrestricted to the index syndrome, were observed in participants across diagnostic categories. The pattern and extent of co-occurrence validate the need for a transdiagnostic approach. The repository of biomaterials as well as digital datasets will serve as a valuable resource for the larger scientific community","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016543v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.06.20016543v2.full.pdf","2020-02-20",NA,"Sreeraj","/highwire/citation/72352/bibtext",49,"210220-49","21-02-2020","72352"
"Digital morphometry of tumor nuclei correlates to BAP-1 status, monosomy 3, gene expression class and survival in uveal melanoma","Cytologic features such as the shape and size of tumor cells can predict metastatic death in uveal melanoma and other cancers but suffer from poor reproducibility. In this study, we investigate the interobserver concordance of digital morphometry, and correlate the results with BRCA associated protein-1 (BAP-1) expression and BAP-1 gene mutation status, monosomy 3, gene expression classifications and patient survival in uveal melanoma. The average number of cells analyzed in each of 107 tumors, was 1957 (SD 349). Mean time consumption was less than 2.5 minutes per tumor. Identical morphometric classification was obtained for >85 % of tumors in all twelve evaluated morphometric variables (Cohen's Kappa 0.70-0.93). The mean nucleus area, nucleus perimeter, nucleus max caliper and nucleus to cell area ratio were significantly greater in tumors with low BAP-1 expression and gene expression class 2. Patients had significantly shorter survival if their tumors had low BAP-1 (Log-Rank p=0.002), gene expression class 2 (p=0.004), long nucleus perimeters (p=0.031), long nucleus max calipers (p=0.029) and high mean nucleus to cell area ratios (p=0.041) as defined in a training cohort and then tested in a validation cohort. In the validation cohort, long nucleus perimeters and long nucleus max calipers correlated with monosomy 3 (Pearson Chi-Square p=0.006 and p=0.009, respectively). Long nucleus perimeters also correlated with BAP-1 mutation (p=0.017). We conclude that digital morphometry can be fast and highly reproducible, that for the first time, morphometry parameters can be objectively quantitated in thousands of cells at a time in sub-micrometer resolutions, and that variables describing the shape and size tumor nuclei correlate to BAP-1 status, monosomy 3, gene expression class as well as patient survival.","/content/10.1101/19010215v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010215v2.full.pdf","2020-02-20",NA,"Herrspiegel","/highwire/citation/72353/bibtext",50,"210220-50","21-02-2020","72353"
"Cognitive functioning and lifetime Major Depressive Disorder in UK Biobank","Background. The degree of cognitive impairment associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) remains uncertain. Previous UK Biobank studies have only shown limited evidence for population-level cognitive differences associated with probable MDD. Here, we used an updated range of cognitive tasks and clinical assessment criteria in UK Biobank to investigate whether there are differences in cognitive function associated with lifetime MDD.
Methods. Associations between lifetime MDD and cognition (performance on six tasks and a general (g) factor) were investigated in UK Biobank (N range 7,457-14,836, age 45-81 years, 52% female), adjusting for demographic, education and lifestyle. Classification of lifetime MDD was based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-SF). Within the lifetime MDD group, we additionally explored relationships between cognition and (i) recurrent MDD, (ii) current MDD symptoms, (iii) severity of psychosocial impairment (while symptomatic), and (iv) concurrent psychotropic medication use
Results. Lifetime MDD was robustly associated with a lower g-factor ( = -0.10, q = 4.710-5), with significant impairments in attention, processing speed and executive functioning ( = 0.06). Analysis within the lifetime MDD group indicated that case individuals with severe psychosocial impairment had significantly lower g-factor ( = -0.14, P = 1.510-2), with greatest impairments in reasoning ( = -0.18, q = 7.510-5). Other clinical characteristics showed differential profiles of cognitive impairment across cognitive domains. 
Conclusions. These findings reveal a modest negative association between lifetime MDD and cognitive performance. Specific cognitive domains showed greater deficits in relation to MDD characteristics, with greatest effects relating to psychosocial impairment.","/content/10.1101/19006031v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006031v1.full.pdf","2019-09-09","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Olanzapine Combined with 5-HT3 RA Plus Dexamethasone for Prevention and Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting in High and Moderate Emetogenic Chemotherapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","Objectives: We performed a pooled analysis to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of olanzapine combined with dexamethasone plus compared with 5 HT3 RA plus dexamethasone for the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in high and moderate emetogenic chemotherapy based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature database (CBM), WanFang Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) (from their inception to April 2019) were searched to capture relevant  articles. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CINV and AEs were all extracted or calculated.
Result: Eleven studies with 1107 cancer patients were involved in this review. The pooled RR of delayed CINV (RR=0.50, 95%CI: 0.38 0.66, P<0.01) were significant decreased in olanzapine group. Besides, the occurrence of insomnia was statistically decreased. The rate of acute CINV (RR=0.60, 95%CI: 0.48 0.75, P<0.01) was also significant decreased. However only the percent of CINV III and CINV IV were significant deceased in acute and delayed phase. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the efficacy was no statistically significant difference between 5mg and 10mg for olanzapine. 
Conclusion: Olanzapine significant decreased the occurrence of CINV III and CINV IV and insomnia in high and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Compared with 10mg per day, 5mg oral may be more appropriate for patients with cancer.","/content/10.1101/19009456v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009456v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Oncology

"Violin plot data: A concerto of crucial information on valve thrombogenicity categorized in vitro by valve motion and inferred flow velocity","Abstract:
Objectives 
This in vitro study compares mechanical (MHV) and bioprosthetic (BHV) heart valves for high amplitude short duration regional flow velocities (RFV) near valve closure.
Background 
We previously tested several clinical and prototype valves and observed RFV at levels which may be related to a dimensionless thrombogenic potential (TP).  
Methods 
A total of four valves were tested in aortic and mitral sites under pulsatile circulation in a pulse duplicator. Valves included both clinical models and experimental prototypes. An optical approach measuring projected dynamic valve area (PDVA) to gauge valve motion was implemented. Pulsatile pressures and flow rates were measured by conventional techniques and a quasi-steady flow tester was used to measure valve leakage. RFV was derived using time-dependent volumetric flow rate/PDVA. Since flow velocity and fluid shear force are related through flow velocity gradient, TPs for valves that achieve near closure during the forward flow deceleration phase were determined as RFVs relative to the control mechanical valve RFV value of -126 m/s.  
Results
TP is dimensionless and ranged between -0.45 and +1.0. Negative TPs arise when transient rebound of valve occluders is accompanied by water-hammer phenomena. Positive TPs occur during the decelerating forward flow. Bioprostheses had lowest TP transient of 0.15 with exception of a mock-transcatheter aortic valve (mTAVI) that incorporated by design a trivial perivalvular leak (~1.35 ml/s). This device demonstrated a remarkably high transient TP of 0.95. The control mechanical valves had the highest TP of 1.0. The study implicates TP transients near mechanical valve closure, and not forward or non-flow phases, as primary to shear induced activation of the coagulation cascade.
Conclusions
Our data reveals distinct TP profile differences between valve models. If verifiable, the design of future valves may utilize currently available experimental tools to determine TPs resulting in advanced devices with significantly reduced TP.","/content/10.1101/19009407v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009407v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Post-discharge Acute Care and Outcomes in the Era of Readmission Reduction","Background: With incentives to reduce readmission rates, there are concerns that patients who need hospitalization after a recent hospital discharge may be denied access, which would increase their risk of mortality.
Objective: We determined whether patients with hospitalizations for conditions covered by national readmission programs who received care in emergency department (ED) or observation units but were not hospitalized within 30 days had an increased risk of death. We also evaluated temporal trends in post-discharge acute care utilization in inpatient units, emergency department (ED) and observation units for these patients.
Design, Setting, and Participants: In this observational study, national Medicare claims data for 2008-2016, we identified patients =65 years hospitalized with heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or pneumonia, conditions included in the HRRP.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Post-discharge 30-day mortality according to patients' 30-day acute care utilization. Acute care utilization in inpatient and observation units, and the ED during the 30-day and 31-90-day post-discharge period. 
Results: There were 3,772,924 hospitalizations for HF, 1,570,113 for AMI, and 3,131,162 for pneumonia. The overall post-discharge 30-day mortality was 8.7% for HF, 7.3% for AMI, and 8.4% for pneumonia. Post-discharge mortality increased annually by 0.16% (95% CI, 0.11%, 0.22%) for HF, decreased by 0.15% (95% CI, -0.18%, -0.12%) for AMI, and did not significantly change for pneumonia. Specifically, mortality only increased for HF patients who did not utilize any post-discharge acute care, increasing at a rate of 0.16% per year (95% CI, 0.11%, 0.22%), accounting for 99% of the increase in post-discharge mortality in heart failure. Concurrent with a reduction in 30-day readmission rates, 30-day observation stays and visits to the ED increased across all 3 conditions during and beyond the post-discharge 30-day period. There was no significant change in overall 30-day post-acute care utilization (P-trend >0.05 for all).
Conclusions and Relevance: The only condition with an increasing mortality through the study period was HF; the increase preceded the policy and was not present among those received ED or observation unit care without hospitalization. Overall, during this period, there was not a significant change in the overall 30-day post-discharge acute care utilization.","/content/10.1101/19002162v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002162v1.full.pdf","2019-07-16","Health Policy

"Semantic computational analysis of anticoagulation use in atrial fibrillation from real world data","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and significantly increases stroke risk. This risk is effectively managed by oral anticoagulation. Recent studies using national registry data indicate increased use of anticoagulation resulting from changes in guidelines and the availability of newer drugs. 
The aim of this study is to develop and validate an open source risk scoring pipeline for free-text electronic health record data using natural language processing. 
AF patients discharged from 1st January 2011 to 1st October 2017 were identified from discharge summaries (N=10,030, 64.6% male, average age 75.3  12.3 years). A natural language processing pipeline was developed to identify risk factors in clinical text and calculate risk for ischaemic stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc) and bleeding (HAS-BLED). Scores were validated vs two independent experts for 40 patients.
Automatic risk scores were in strong agreement with the two independent experts for CHA2DS2-VASc (average kappa 0.78 vs experts, compared to 0.85 between experts). Agreement was lower for HAS-BLED (average kappa 0.54 vs experts, compared to 0.74 between experts).
In high-risk patients (CHA2DS2-VASc >2) OAC use has increased significantly over the last 7 years, driven by the availability of DOACs and the transitioning of patients from AP medication alone to OAC. Factors independently associated with OAC use included components of the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores as well as discharging specialty and frailty. OAC use was highest in patients discharged under cardiology (69%).
Electronic health record text can be used for automatic calculation of clinical risk scores at scale. Open source tools are available today for this task but require further validation. Analysis of routinely-collected EHR data can replicate findings from large-scale curated registries.","/content/10.1101/19011643v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011643v1.full.pdf","2019-11-12","Health Informatics

"Driving Me Crazy: The effects of stress on the driving abilities of paramedic students.","Background:
Previous research has demonstrated that stress has a negative impact on the performance of paramedics. Stress negatively impact the driving abilities of the general population increasing the number of driving errors performed. No studies have explored stress and its link with the driving abilities of paramedics. 

Methods:
Paramedic students underwent driving assessment in a driving simulator before and after exposure to a stressful medical scenario. Number and type of errors were documented before and after. 

Results:
36 students participated in the study. Following exposure to a stressful medical scenario, paramedic students demonstrated no increase in overall error rate, but demonstrated an increase in three critical driving errors; failure to wear a seatbelt (3 baseline v 10 post stress, p= 0.0087), failing to stop for red lights or stop signs (7 v 35, p= <0.0001), and losing controlling of the vehicle (2 v 11, p= 0.0052). 

Conclusion:
Paramedics are routinely exposed to acute stress and this stress could increase the number of critical driving errors that occur. These results stimulate the need for further research, and highlight the potential need for increased driver training and stress management education in order to mitigate the frequency and severity of driving errors.","/content/10.1101/19003491v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003491v1.full.pdf","2019-08-01","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Inferring the role of the microbiome on survival in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: causal modeling, timing, and classes of concomitant medications","The microbiome has been shown to affect the response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) in a small number of cancers. Here, we sought to more broadly survey cancers to identify those in which the microbiome will play a role using retrospective analyes. We created a causal model for the relationship between medications, the microbiome and ICI response and used it to guide the abstraction of electronic health records of 690 patients who received ICI therapy for advanced cancer. Medications associated with changes to the microbiome including antibiotics, corticosteroids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine receptor blockers, non-steroid anti-inflammatories and statins were abstracted. We tested the effect of medication timing on overall survival (OS) and evaluated the robustness of medication effects in each cancer. Finally, we compared the size of the effect observed for antibiotics classes to taxa correlated with ICI response and a literature review of culture-based antibiotic susceptibilities. Of the medications assessed, only antibiotics and corticosteroids significantly associated with lower OS. The hazard ratios (HRs) for antibiotics and corticosteroids were highest near the start of ICI treatment but remained significant when given prior to ICI. Antibiotics and corticosteroids remained significantly associated with OS even when controlling for multiple factors such as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and stage. When grouping antibiotics by class, -lactams showed the strongest association with OS across all tested cancers. The timing and strength of these effects after controlling for confounding factors are consistent with role for the microbiome in response to ICIs.","/content/10.1101/19006429v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006429v1.full.pdf","2019-09-13","Oncology

"Efficient prediction of vitamin B deficiencies via machine-learning using routine blood test results in patients with intense psychiatric episode","Background: Vitamin B deficiency is common worldwide and may lead to psychiatric symptoms; however, vitamin B deficiency epidemiology in patients with intense psychiatric episode has rarely been examined. Moreover, vitamin deficiency testing is costly and time-consuming. It hampered to effectively rule out vitamin deficiency-induced intense psychiatric symptoms. In this study, we aimed to clarify the epidemiology of these deficiencies and efficiently predict them using machine-learning models from patient characteristics and routine blood test results that can be obtained within one hour.
Methods: We reviewed 497 consecutive patients deemed to be at imminent risk of seriously harming themselves or others over 2 years. Machine-learning models were trained to predict each deficiency from age, sex, and 29 routine blood test results.
Results: We found that 112 (22.5%), 80 (16.1%), and 72 (14.5%) patients had vitamin B1, vitamin B12, and folate (vitamin B9) deficiency, respectively. Also, the machine-learning models well generalized to predict the deficiency in the future unseen data; areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the validation dataset (i.e. dataset not used for training the models) were 0.716, 0.599, and 0.796, respectively. The Gini importance of these vitamins provided further evidence of a relationship between these vitamins and the complete blood count, while also indicating a hitherto rarely considered, potential association between these vitamins and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).
Discussion: This study demonstrates that machine-learning can efficiently predict some vitamin deficiencies in patients with active psychiatric symptoms, based on the largest cohort to date with intense psychiatric episode. The prediction method may expedite risk stratification and clinical decision-making regarding whether replacement therapy should be prescribed. Further research includes validating its external generalizability in other clinical situations and clarify whether interventions based on this method can improve patient care and cost-effectiveness.","/content/10.1101/19004317v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004317v1.full.pdf","2019-08-13","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Evaluation of Patient-Level Retrieval from Electronic Health Record Data for a Cohort Discovery Task","Objective

Growing numbers of academic medical centers offer patient cohort discovery tools to their researchers, yet the performance of systems for this use case is not well-understood. The objective of this research was to assess patient-level information retrieval (IR) methods using electronic health records (EHR), and to investigate the interplay between commonly used IR approaches and the cohort definition structure.

Materials and Methods

Using the Cranfield IR evaluation methodology, we developed a test collection based on 56 test topics characterizing patient cohort requests for various clinical studies. Test collection data was derived from patient records originating from OHSUs EHR data warehouse. Automated IR tasks were performed, varying four different parameters for a total of 48 permutations, with performance measured using B-Pref. We subsequently created 56 structured Boolean queries for the 56 topics for performance comparisons. Finally, we designed 59 taxonomy characteristics to classify the structure of the 56 topics. Six topic complexity measures were derived from these characteristics for further evaluation using a beta regression simulation.

Results

The best-performing word-based automated query parameter settings achieved a mean B-Pref of 0.167 across all 56 topics. The way a topic was structured (topic representation) had the largest impact on performance. Performance not only varied widely across topics, but there was also a large variance in sensitivity to parameter settings across the topics. Structured queries generally performed better than automated queries on measures of recall and precision, but were still not able to recall all relevant patients found by the automated queries. We also found strong performance associations with the six complexity measures created from the topic taxonomy, and interactions with automated query parameter settings.

Conclusion

While word-based automated methods of cohort retrieval offer an attractive solution to the labor-intensive nature of this task currently used at many medical centers, we generally found suboptimal performance in the methods tested for this study. Some of the characteristics derived from a query taxonomy could lead to improved selection of approaches based on the structure of the topic of interest. Insights gained here will help guide future work to develop new methods for patient-level cohort discovery with EHR data.","/content/10.1101/19005280v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005280v1.full.pdf","2019-08-25","Health Informatics

"Impacts of lack of pocket money on undergraduate students' clinical learning activities","Background: In Ethiopia, There is a poor understanding of university expenses, regardless of the challenges that undergraduate students faced due to lack of pocket money and its tremendous impacts on learning activities. 
In addition, undergraduate health sciences students need additional money when they start clinical placement learning. 
Objectives: to explore the economic challenges that clinical year undergraduate health sciences students face with limited pocket money; and students' perceive of how limited pocket money affects their learning activities and how they react to challenges.
Methods: The descriptive qualitative study was conducted at Addis Ababa University (AAU) , College of Health Sciences(CHS) Medical Radiology Technology (MRT) department at Addis Ababa University. Ten participants recruited through purposive and snowball method; and the semi-structured interviews took place from January 28, 2019 to February 1, 2019. The Semi-structured questions explored participants' experiences and perceptions regarding  challenges of lack of pocket money and its impacts on their learning activities, and their reaction to financial challenges. 
Results: Four themes emerged from the interviews based on the research objectives, and they are challenges of getting pocket money, difficulty of affording important needs, self-management; and social life. 
Conclusion: Based on the data, the underlying causes that lead students to face financial hardships can be solved by making public awareness regarding university expenses, clarifying the cost sharing system to the public, redesigning the cost sharing policy, improving university administration. In addition, giving short training to students on self-management and money management skills and, as well giving special attention to clinical practice facilities primarily concluded from the participants' descriptions.

"Machine learning-based imaging biomarkers improve statistical power in clinical trials","Radiomic models, which leverage complex imaging patterns and machine learning, are increasingly accurate in predicting patient response to treatment and clinical outcome on an individual patient basis. In this work, we show that this predictive power can be utilized in clinical trials to significantly increase statistical power to detect treatment effects or reduce the sample size required to achieve a given power. Akin to the historical control paradigm, we propose to utilize a radiomic prediction model to generate a pseudo-control sample for each individual in the trial of interest. We then incorporate these pseudo-controls into the analysis of the clinical trial of interest using classical and well established statistical tools, and investigate statistical power. Effectively, this approach utilizes each individual's radiomics-based predictor of outcome for comparison with the actual outcome, potentially increasing statistical power considerably, depending on the accuracy of the predictor. In simulations of treatment effects based on real radiomic predictive models from brain cancer and prodromal Alzheimer's Disease, we show that this methodology can decrease the required sample sizes by as much as a half, depending on the strength of the radiomic predictor. We further find that this method is most helpful when treatment effect sizes are small and that power grows with the accuracy of radiomic prediction.","/content/10.1101/19010041v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010041v1.full.pdf","2019-10-29","Radiology and Imaging

"Identifying Acute Low Back Pain Episodes in Primary Care Practice from Clinical Notes","Acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) are different conditions with different treatments. However, they are coded in electronic health records with the same ICD-10 code (M54.5) and can be differentiated only by retrospective chart reviews. This prevents efficient definition of data driven guidelines for billing and therapy recommendations, such as return to-work options. To solve this issue, we evaluate the feasibility of automatically distinguishing acute LBP episodes by analyzing free text clinical notes. We used a dataset of 17,409 clinical notes from different primary care practices; of these, 891 documents were manually annotated as ""acute LBP"" and 2,973 were generally associated with LBP via the recorded ICD-10 code. We compared different supervised and unsupervised strategies for automated identification: keyword search; topic modeling; logistic regression with bag-of-n-grams and manual features; and deep learning (ConvNet). We trained the supervised models using either manual annotations or ICD-10 codes as positive labels. ConvNet trained using manual annotations obtained the best results with an AUC-ROC of 0.97 and F-score of 0.72. ConvNet's results were also robust to reduction of the number of manually annotated documents. In the absence of manual annotations, topic models performed better than methods trained using ICD-10 codes, which were unsatisfactory for identifying LBP acuity. This study uses clinical notes to delineate a potential path toward systematic learning of therapeutic strategies, billing guidelines, and management options for acute LBP at the point of care.","/content/10.1101/19010462v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010462v1.full.pdf","2019-11-05","Health Informatics

"Health Care Provider Compliance with the HIPAA Right of Individual Access: A Scorecard and Survey","Abstract

Background: Historically, patients have had difficulty obtaining copies of their medical records, notwithstanding the legal right to do so. In 2018, a study of 83 top hospitals found discrepancies between those hospitals published information and telephone survey responses regarding their processes for release of records to patients, indicating noncompliance with the HIPAA right of individual access.

Objective: Assess state of compliance with the HIPAA right of access across a broader range of health care providers and in the context of real records requests from patients. 
 
Methods: Evaluate the degree of compliance with the HIPAA right of access by 1) scoring the responses of 51 health care providers to actual patient record requests against the HIPAA right of access requirements and 2) through additional telephone surveys of health care institutions regarding release of records to patients.  
 
Results: Based on the scores of responses of 51 health care providers to record requests and the responses of 3003 healthcare institutions to telephone surveys, more than 50% of health care providers are out of compliance with the HIPAA right of access. The most common failures were refusal to send records to patient or a patients designee by e-mail; health care institutions responses to telephone survey also indicate 24% are potentially noncompliant with HIPAA fee limitations. With respect to actual patient record requests, for 71% of providers the records were provided in compliance with HIPAA only after supervisors and privacy officials were educated on HIPAA requirements.  

Conclusions: Recent federal proposals prioritize patient access to medical records through certified electronic health record (EHR) technology, but access by patients to their complete clinical records via EHRs is years away. In the meantime, health care providers need to focus more attention on compliance with the HIPAA right of access, including better training of staff on HIPAA requirements. Greater enforcement of the law will help motivate providers to prioritize this issue.","/content/10.1101/19004291v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004291v1.full.pdf","2019-08-13","Health Policy

"Identification of de novo mutations in prenatal neurodevelopment-associated genes in schizophrenia in two Han Chinese patient-sibling family-based cohorts","Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. High heritability of SCZ suggests a major role for transmitted genetic variants. Furthermore, SCZ is also associated with a marked reduction in fecundity, leading to the hypothesis that alleles with large effects on risk might often occur de novo. In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing for 23 families from two cohorts, Taiwan and Shanghai, with matched unaffected siblings and parents. Two nonsense de novo mutations (DNMs) in GJC1 and HIST1H2AD were identified in SCZ patients. By performing DNM-based burden test, we found that DPYSL2, NBPF1, SDK1, ZNF595, ZNF718, GCNT2, SNX9, AACS, KCNQ1 and MSI2 genes carried more DNMs in SCZ patients than their unaffected siblings. Developmental expression analyses revealed that the loss-of-function DNM genes and DNM-burdened genes showed significantly higher expression in prefrontal cortex in prenatal stage. The biased high expression of GJC1 and SDK1 in fetus were preserved in other brain regions and conserved across species. Data from genome-wide association studies suggested that common variants in the GJC1, HIST1H2AD and SDK1 genes may contribute to the risks of SCZ and SCZ-related traits. Analyses on GJC1 revealed that genes co-expressed with GJC1 were involved in SCZ, SCZ-associated pathways and drug targets. GJC1 may be a potential target for SCZ in prenatal and early neurodevelopment.","/content/10.1101/19011007v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19011007v1.full.pdf","2019-11-04","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Association of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms with Dyslipidemia in Antiretroviral Exposed HIV Patients: A Case-Control Study in a Ghanaian population","Dyslipidemia is a potential complication of long-term usage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and also known to be associated with genetic factors. The host genetic variants associated with dyslipidemia HIV patients on ART in Ghana have not been fully explored. A total of 289 HIV-infected patients on stable ART for at least a year and 104 age-matched controls with no history of HIV and dyslipidemia were recruited for the study. Fasting blood was collected into EDTA for lipids measurements. Lipid profiles were determined as a measure of dyslipidemia. There was a significant difference in case-control prevalence for dyslipidemia (31.4% vs. 18.3%, p=0.013). Four candidate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from four genes (ABCA1-rs2066714, LDLR-rs6511720, APOA5-rs662799 and DSCAML1-rs10892151) were determined. Genotyping was performed on isolated genomic DNA of study participants using PCR followed by a multiplex Ligation Detection Reaction (LDR). Significantly increased levels of total cholesterol (TC) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides [TG] were observed in protease inhibitor-based (PI) treated case subjects compared to non-PI-based case subjects. The population frequency of homozygotes for the rare alleles rs6511720 (T/T), rs2066714 (G/G), rs10892151 (T/T) and rs662799 (G/G) were 3.6%, 9.6%, 6.4% and 6.0%, respectively. Adjusted analysis controlling for age, gender and duration of treatment revealed that rare homozygous genotypes for APOA5 (G/G) [aOR=18.74(5.65-54.73), p<0.0001], ABCA1 (G/G) [aOR=3.94(0.86 -17.38), p=0.033] and DSCAML1 (T/T) [aOR=11.46(3.651-43.56), p<0.0001) were significant factors for high TC. Subjects with the T/T genotype for DSCAML1 (rs10892151) were associated with a high likelihood of raised levels of LDL-C [aOR=3.76(1.43-8.46), p=0.033]. Furthermore, the rare homozygous genotype for ABCA1 (G/G) [aOR=5.67(3.43-13.54), p<0.0001] and LDLR (T/T) [aOR=4.46(1.86-10.56), p<0.0001) was significantly associated with hypertriglyceridemia. The study has demonstrated the presence of SNPs in four candidate genes among HIV patients exposed to ART in the Ghanaian population. SNPs were found to associate with dyslipidemia. These findings provide baseline information that necessitates a pre-symptomatic strategy for monitoring dyslipidemia in ART-treated HIV patients. There is a need for longitudinal studies to validate a comprehensive number of SNPs and its association with dyslipidemia.","/content/10.1101/19004812v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004812v1.full.pdf","2019-08-23","HIV/AIDS

"Altered subcortical emotional salience processing differentiates Parkinson's patients with and without psychotic symptoms","Background: Current research does not provide a clear explanation for why some patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) develop psychotic symptoms. In the field of schizophrenia research the 'aberrant salience hypothesis' of psychosis has been influential. According to the theory, dopaminergic dysregulation leads to the inappropriate attribution of salience to otherwise irrelevant or non-informative stimuli, allowing for the formation of hallucinations and delusions. This theory has not yet been extensively investigated in the context of psychosis in PD. Methods: We investigated salience processing in 14 PD patients with a history of psychotic symptoms, 23 PD patients without psychotic symptoms and 19 healthy controls. All patients received dopaminergic medication. We examined emotional salience using a visual oddball fMRI paradigm (Bunzeck and Duezel, 2006) that previously has been used to investigate early stages of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, controlling for resting cerebral blood flow as assessed with arterial spin labelling fMRI. Results: We found significant differences between patient groups in brain responses to emotional salience. PD patients with psychotic symptoms revealed senhanced brain responses in the striatum, the hippocampus and the amygdala compared to PD patients without psychotic symptoms. PD patients with psychotic symptoms also showed significant correlations between the levels of dopaminergic drugs they were taking and BOLD signalling, as well as psychotic symptom scores. Furthermore, our data provide a first indication for dysfunctional top-down processes, measured in a 'jumping to conclusions' bias. Conclusion: Our study suggests that enhanced signalling in the striatum, hippocampus and amygdala together with deficient top-down cognitive regulations is associated with the development of psychotic symptoms in PD which is similar to that proposed in the 'aberrant salience hypothesis' of psychosis in schizophrenia.","/content/10.1101/19010512v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19010512v1.full.pdf","2019-11-02","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Towards a differential diagnosis of cochlear synaptopathy and outer-hair-cell deficits in mixed sensorineural hearing loss pathologies","Damage to the auditory periphery is more widespread than predicted by the gold-standard clinical audiogram. Noise exposure, ototoxicity and aging can destroy cochlear inner-hair-cell afferent synapses and result in a degraded subcortical representation of sound while leaving hearing thresh- olds unaffected. Damaged afferent synapses, i.e. cochlear synaptopathy, can be quantified using histology, but a differential diagnosis in living hu- mans is difficult: histology cannot be applied and existing auditory evoked potential (AEP) metrics for synaptopathy become insensitive when other sensorineural hearing impairments co-exist (e.g., outer-hair-cell damage associated with elevated hearing thresholds). To develop a non-invasive diagnostic method which quantifies synaptopathy in humans and animals with normal or elevated hearing thresholds, we employ a computational model approach in combination with human AEP and psychoacoustics. We propose the use of a sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) map which comprises two relative AEP-based metrics to quantify the respective de- grees of synaptopathy and OHC damage and evaluate to which degree our predictions of AEP alterations can explain individual data-points in recorded SNHL maps from listeners with normal or elevated audiometric thresholds. We conclude that SNHL maps can offer a more precise diag- nostic tool than existing AEP methods for individual assessment of the synaptopathy and OHC-damage aspect of sensorineural hearing loss.","/content/10.1101/19008680v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008680v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Otolaryngology

"Cost-effectiveness of the next generation of RSV intervention strategies","Background
With a suite of promising new RSV prophylactics on the horizon, including long-acting monoclonal antibodies and new vaccines, it is likely that one or more of these will replace the current monoclonal Palivizumab programme. However, choosing the optimal intervention programme will require balancing the costs of the programmes with the health benefits accrued. 

Methods
To compare the next generation of RSV prophylactics, we integrated a novel transmission model with an economic analysis. We estimated key epidemiological parameters by calibrating the model to seven years of historical epidemiological data using a Bayesian approach. We determined the cost-effective and affordable maximum purchase price for a comprehensive suite of intervention programmes. 
 
Findings
Our transmission model suggests that maternal protection of infants is seasonal, with 2-14% of infants born with protection against RSV. Our economic analysis found that to cost-effectively and affordably replace the current monoclonal antibody Palivizumab programme with long-acting monoclonal antibodies, the purchase price per dose would have to be less than around <U+FFE1>4,350 but dropping to <U+FFE1>200 for vaccinated heightened risk infants or <U+FFE1>90 for all infants. A seasonal maternal vaccine would have to be priced less than <U+FFE1>85 to be cost-effective and affordable. While vaccinating pre-school and school-age children is likely not cost-effective relative to elderly vaccination programmes, vaccinating the elderly is not likely to be affordable. Conversely, vaccinating infants at 2 months seasonally would be cost-effective and affordable if priced less than <U+FFE1>80.
 
Interpretations
In a setting with seasonal RSV epidemiology, maternal protection conferred to newborns is also seasonal, an assumption not previously incorporated in transmission models of RSV. For a country with seasonal RSV dynamics like England, seasonal programmes rather than year-round intervention programmes are always optimal.","/content/10.1101/19009977v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009977v1.full.pdf","2019-10-22","Public and Global Health

"Brain network disruption predicts memory and attention deficits after surgical resection of glioma","Surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective treatments to delay brain tumour progression and improve survival. Nevertheless, a large proportion of patients have treatment-induced cognitive deficits that dramatically reduce their life quality. A major problem in basic and clinical neuroscience is that the dispersed and interlocking nature of cognitive circuits makes predicting functional impairments challenging. Here we investigated tumour interactions with brain networks in relation to cognitive recovery after surgical resection and during chemo-radiotherapy treatment. 17 patients with low- and high-grade glioma (aged 22-56 years) were longitudinally MRI-scanned and cognitively assessed using a tablet-based screening tool before and after surgery, and during a 12-months recovery period. Using structural MRI and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) derived from diffusion-weighted images, we respectively estimated tumour overlap and Neurite Density (as an in-vivo proxy measure of axon and dendrite concentration) with brain networks and functional maps derived from normative data in healthy participants. We found that neither total lesion volume nor tumour location based on traditional lobular divisions were associated with memory or attention deficits. However, tumour and lesion overlap with the Default Mode Network (DMN), Attention Network and attention-related regions located in frontal and parietal cortex was associated with memory and attention deficits. This association was above and beyond the contributions of preoperative cognitive status and tumour volume (Linear Mixed Model, Pfdr<0.05). On the other hand, Neurite Density derived was reduced not only within the tumour, but also beyond the tumour boundary, revealing a distal effect that can have global consequences on brain networks. High preoperative Neurite Density outside the tumour, but within the Frontoparietal Network was associated with better memory and attention recovery. Moreover, postoperative and follow-up Neurite Density within the DMN, Frontoparietal and Attention Networks was also associated with memory and attention improvements (Pfdr<0.05). We conclude that gliomas located on brain networks that are fundamental for cognitive processing mediate cognitive deficits in patients with brain tumours and that, despite being focal lesions, they exert a distal effect on Neurite Density in these networks that is also associated with cognitive recovery. Our work provides insights into the brain reorganisation that occurs due to the presence of a tumour and its potential capability to predict treatment-induced cognitive deficits. A better understanding of the impact of treatment on these brain circuits would contribute to designing multimodal biomarkers for enhancing patient stratification and tailored rehabilitation to better preserve cognitive function.","/content/10.1101/19008581v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008581v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Radiology and Imaging

"Time trends in socio-economic inequalities in HIV testing: insights from population-based surveys in 16 sub-Saharan African countries","Background
Overall increase in the uptake of HIV testing in the past decades may hide discrepancies across socio-economic groups. We used population-based surveys conducted in sub-Saharan Africa to quantify socio-economic inequalities in recent HIV testing uptake, together with their trends over the two past decades.
Methods
We analyzed the data from Demographic and Health Surveys in sub-Saharan African countries where at least one survey was conducted before and after 2008. Country- and gender-specific proportions of recent (<12 month) HIV testing were assessed across wealth and education groups, and inequalities were quantified using the relative and slope indices of inequalities. Time trends in inequalities were assessed and results were pooled across countries using random-effect meta-analyses.
Findings
We analyzed data from 32 surveys conducted between 2003 and 2016 in 16 countries among 537,784 participants. In pre-2008 surveys, women reported higher HIV testing uptake than men in 8 out of 16 countries, and in 15 out of 16 countries in post-2008 surveys. After 2008, the wealthiest women were on average 2.77 (95% CI 1.42-5.40) times more likely to report recent testing than the poorest; and 3.55 (1.85-6.81) times in men. The averaged absolute difference in recent testing between the richest and poorest was 11.1 (4.6-17.5) percentage points in women and 15.1 (9.6-20.6) in men. Over time, relative inequalities in recent HIV testing decreased in both genders, while absolute inequalities plateaued in women and increased in men.

Interpretations	
The overall increase in HIV testing uptake that was stimulated by the impetus to scale up HIV treatment in sub-Saharan Africa led to a decrease in relative inequalities, while absolute inequalities persisted. Within most countries, large inequalities still remained, both in absolute and relative scales, especially in West and Central Africa. A greater focus should be put on equity in monitoring HIV testing programs.

"Efficacy of a spatial repellent for control of malaria in Indonesia: a cluster-randomized controlled trial.","A randomized cluster, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to estimate protective efficacy of a spatial repellent against malaria infection at Sumba, Indonesia. Following radical cure in 1,332 children aged 6mo-5yrs in 24 clusters, households were given transfluthrin or placebo passive emanators. Monthly blood screening and biweekly human-landing mosquito catches (HLC) were performed during 10-months baseline (June 2015 to March 2016) and a 24-month intervention period (April 2016 to April 2018).  Screening detected 164 first-time malaria infections and an accumulative total of 459 infections in 667 subjects in placebo-control households; and 134 first-time and 253 accumulative total infections among 665 subjects in active intervention households. The 24-cluster protective effect of 27.7% and 31.3%, for time to first-event and overall (total new) infections, respectively, was not statistically significant. Purportedly, this due in part to zero to low incidence in some clusters during intervention undermining the ability to detect an effect.

Primary entomological analysis of impact proved not statistically significant, with indoor and outdoor anopheline HLC reduced by 16.4% and 11.3%, respectively. Among 12 high-risk clusters, a significant impact on infection was detected (about 60% protective efficacy).

"Demonstration of a portable intracortical brain-computer interface","While recent advances in intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) have demonstrated the ability to restore motor and communication functions, such demonstrations have generally been confined to controlled experimental settings and have required bulky laboratory hardware. Here, we developed and evaluated a self-contained portable iBCI that enabled the user to interact with various computer programs. The iBCI, which weighs 1.5 kg, consists of digital headstages, a small signal processing hub, and a tablet PC. A human participant tested the portable iBCI in laboratory and home settings under an FDA Investigational Device Exemption (NCT01894802). The participant successfully completed 96% of trials in a 2D cursor center-out task with the portable iBCI, a rate indistinguishable from that achieved with the standard laboratory iBCI. The participant also completed a variety of free-form tasks, including drawing, gaming, and typing.","/content/10.1101/19004721v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004721v1.full.pdf","2019-09-23","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"A spatio-temporal approach to short-term forecasting of visceral leishmaniasis diagnoses in India","Background:
The elimination programme for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in India has seen great progress, with total cases decreasing by over 80% since 2010 and many blocks now reporting zero cases from year to year.  Prompt diagnosis and treatment is critical to continue progress and avoid epidemics in the increasingly susceptible population. Short-term forecasts could be used to highlight anomalies in incidence and support health service logistics. The model which best fits the data is not necessarily most useful for prediction, yet little empirical work has been done to investigate the balance between fit and predictive performance. 
Principal Findings: 
We developed statistical models of monthly VL case counts at block level. By evaluating a set of randomly-generated models, we found that fit and one-month-ahead prediction were strongly correlated and that rolling updates to model parameters as data accrued were not crucial for accurate prediction.  The final model incorporated auto-regression over four months, spatial correlation between neighbouring blocks,and seasonality. Ninety-four percent of 10-90% prediction intervals from this model captured the observed count during a 24-month test period.  Comparison of one-, three- and four-month-ahead predictions from the final model fit demonstrated that a longer time horizon yielded only a small sacrifice in predictive power for the vast majority of blocks.
Conclusions:
The model developed is informed by routinely-collected surveillance data as it accumulates, and predictions are sufficiently accurate and precise to be useful.  Such forecasts could, for example, be used to guide stock requirements for rapid diagnostic tests and drugs.  More comprehensive data on factors thought to influence geographic variation in VL burden could be incorporated, and might better explain the heterogeneity between blocks and improve uniformity of predictive performance.Integration of the approach in the management of the VL programme would be an important step to ensuring continued successful control. and processing of the data,predictive power more than three months ahead of current data is crucial to make forecasts which can feasibly be acted upon. Some heterogeneity remains in predictive power across the study region which could potentially be improved using unit-specific data on factors believed to be associated with reported VL incidence (e.g. age distribution, socio-economic status and climate)","/content/10.1101/19009258v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009258v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Public and Global Health

"LncRNA and predictive model for improving the diagnosis of clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis","Background: Clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients lack Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) pathogenic evidence, and misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis often occurs in clinical practice. We aimed to investigate the potential of lncRNAs and corresponding predictive models to diagnose these patients. Methods and Findings:  We totally enrolled 1372 subjects in three cohorts and conducted this study through a prospective four-step approach. In the Screening Step, we discovered five lncRNA candidates from blood samples using microarray on a small cohort. In the Selection Step, we used qRT-PCR to test five lncRNAs on the Selection Cohort (141 clinically diagnosed PTB patients, 159 non-TB disease controls, 578 healthy subjects) and determined three differentially expressed lncRNAs (ENST00000497872, n333737, n335265). In the Model Training Step, we developed logistic regression models to distinguish clinically diagnosed PTB cases from suspected patients of the Selection Cohort, by combining these three lncRNAs with patients' electronic health records (EHRs). The model with the best c-statistic of 0.91 was presented as a Web-based nomogram (nine variables: ENST00000497872, n333737, n335265, age, hemoglobin, weight loss, low-grade fever, CT calcification, TB-IGRA; available at https://xuejiao.shinyapps.io/shiny/). In the Validation Step, the nomogram was evaluated in the independent Validation Cohort, with good calibration and discrimination (c-statistic: 0.89, sensitivity: 0.80 and specificity: 0.85). A higher clinical net benefit was observed in the nomogram as compared with the EHR model using decision curve analysis. Additionally, The biological function of the most significant lncRNA was interrogated using ELISA, lactate dehydrogenase release analysis and flow cytometry. The results indicated that ENST00000497872 may involve in regulating inflammatory cytokine production, cell death and apoptosis during MTB infection. Conclusions: LncRNAs (ENST00000497872, n333737, n335265)  could be potential diagnostic biomarkers for clinically diagnosed PTB. The nomogram incorporating lncRNAs and EHRs showed good performance in identifying clinically diagnosed PTB patients. Utilizing the user-friendly nomogram could facilitate the rapid identification of PTB cases among highly suspected patients with negative MTB pathogenic evidence, and thereby help to optimize TB diagnostic procedure.","/content/10.1101/19000281v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000281v1.full.pdf","2019-07-03","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"The day-to-day experiences of caring for children with Osteogenesis Imperfecta: A qualitative descriptive study","Purpose: Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a rare genetic condition known to cause bone fragility. Family caregivers, such as parents, of children with OI play an important role in helping these children live well at home. This study aimed to explore the day-to-day experiences of caregivers who are caring for children with OI. 

Materials and Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. Eighteen adult caregivers of children with OI were recruited at a children's hospital in Montreal, Canada to participate in individual interviews. The interviews were transcribed and inductively thematically analysed.

Results: The following caregiving themes were identified in these interviews: regular day-to-day caregiving activities, including morning routines, evening routines, and the facilitation of their child's mobilization; periods that made the caregiving routine more challenging, such as fractures, surgeries, and pain; and the long-term strategies caregivers employed to support day-to-day care, such as managing the environment, accessing medical and school resources, and coordinating care and respite.

Conclusions: The results showcase what being a caregiver for a child with OI involves on a day-to-day basis. The recommendations include suggestions for future clinical, policy, and research endeavours to better support family caregivers of children with OI.","/content/10.1101/19007187v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007187v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Nursing

"Lower germline mutation rates in young adults predict longer lives and longer reproductive lifespans","BACKGROUND
Genome sequencing of large three-generation families allows identification of de novo mutations (DNMs) in the middle-generation and their attribution to the specific grandparental germlines in which they arose. We hypothesized that germline DNM accumulation during aging may limit the duration of childbearing in women, and if accompanied by mutation accumulation in somatic tissues, reflect aging rates generally in both sexes. Here we test whether germ cell DNMs present in the grandparent generation when they were young adults predict two clinically important outcomes in those same individuals: survival in both sexes, and age-related fertility decline in women.

METHODS
Germline DNM counts were determined in 122 grandparents from 33 three-generation Utah families and converted to DNM rates by normalizing each subject's DNM counts to the callable fraction of their genome. Age at death, cause of death, cancer incidence, and reproductive histories were provided by the Utah Population Database and the Utah Cancer Registry. Fertility analyses were restricted to the 53 grandmothers whose age at last birth (ALB) was at least 30 years, the approximate age when the decline in female fertility ending with menopause begins.

RESULTS
After adjusting for birth year, sex and parental age effects in Cox proportional hazard regression models, a one standard deviation increase in DNM rates was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality in both sexes combined (hazard ratio [HR], 1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-3.46; p=0.019). Women in the top 75% of DNM rates had higher all-cause mortality than women in the bottom 25% (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.03-4.46; p=0.043); and men in the top 25% of DNM rates had higher all-cause mortality than men in the bottom 25% (HR, 4.37; 95% CI, 1.54-12.44; p=0.006). Among women with ALB = 30 years, those in the top 50% of DNM rates had significantly fewer live births than those in the bottom 25% (p=0.026), and higher DNM rates were significantly associated (p=0.036) with a younger ALB (< 25th percentile, 34.8 years).

CONCLUSIONS
Germline mutation accumulation rates in healthy young adults may provide a measure of both reproductive and systemic aging. The data further suggest that inter-individual differences in mutation accumulation rates are established around puberty, just when DNA repair genes' expression levels are known to begin their lifelong decline.","/content/10.1101/19004184v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004184v1.full.pdf","2019-08-13","Epidemiology

"PheWAS-ME: A web-app for interactive exploration of multimorbidity patterns in PheWAS","Summary: Electronic health records (EHRs) linked with a DNA biobank provide unprecedented opportunities to use big data for biomedical research in precision medicine. The Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) is a widely used technique for high-throughput evaluation of relationships between a set of genetic variants and a large collection of clinical phenotypes recorded in EHRs. PheWAS analyses are typically presented as static tables and charts of summary statistics obtained from statistical tests of association between pairs of a genetic variant and individual phenotypes. Comorbidities are common and typically lead to complex, multivariate gene-disease association signals that are challenging to interpret. Discovering and interrogating multimorbidity patterns and their influence in PheWAS is difficult and time- consuming. Here, we present a web application to visualize individual-level genotype and phenotype data side-by-side with PheWAS analysis results in an interactive dashboard, allowing researchers to explore multimorbidity patterns and their associations with a genetic variant of interest. We expect this application to enrich PheWAS analyses by illuminating clinical multimorbidity patterns present in the data.","/content/10.1101/19009480v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009480v1.full.pdf","2019-10-24","Health Informatics

"An Environment-Wide Study of Adult Cognitive Performance in the 23andMe Cohort","BACKGROUND: With the emergence of web-based data collection methods, large digital health cohorts offer the opportunity to conduct behavioral and epidemiologic research at an unprecedented scale. The size and breadth of such data sets enable discovery of novel associations across the phenotypic spectrum. 
METHODS: We deployed the digital symbol substitution test (DSST) online to consented 23andMe research participants 50-85 years of age. We tested cross-sectional associations between DSST performance and 824 phenotypes using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, age*sex interaction, device, time of cohort entry, and ancestry, separately among discovery (n=144,786) and replication (n=93,428) samples; additional analyses further adjusted for education. We post-stratified association estimates on age, sex, and education to adjust for discrepancies across subsamples. Leveraging the rich genetic and phenotypic data available at 23andMe, we also estimated genetic and environmental correlations between DSST and its top correlates using linkage disequilibrium score regression. 
RESULTS: 97 phenotypes were significantly (false discovery rate < 0.05) and strongly (standardized effect size > |0.5|) associated with DSST performance in the discovery phase. Of those, 60 (38 with additional adjustment for education) demonstrated both statistical significance and consistent direction of association in the replication sample. The significantly associated phenotypes largely clustered into the following categories: psychiatric traits (e.g. anxiety,  per 1 SD = -0.74, P-value=3.9x10-169), education (e.g. highest math class completed,  per 1 SD = 2.11, P-value<1 x 10-300), leisure activities (e.g. solitary activities like puzzles,  per 1 SD = 1.85, P-value<1.0x10-300), social determinants (e.g. household income,  per 1 SD = 1.20, P-value= 8.9x10-245, and lifestyle (e.g. years smoked,  per 1 SD = -0.98, P-value= 2.2x10-78). We identified several reproducible genetic correlations between DSST and its top associated exposures (e.g. 0.48 for leisure activities like puzzles, 0.28 for years of education, and -0.24 for anxiety; all P = 7.9x10-26). For almost all exposures, genetic correlations with DSST were considerably stronger than environmental correlations. 
CONCLUSIONS: We have conducted the largest study of cognitive performance to date, building evidence supporting its correlations with many social, lifestyle, and clinical exposures. We established that the observed associations are in part underpinned by shared genetic architecture. Our study illustrates the potential of large-scale digital cohorts to contribute to epidemiologic discovery.","/content/10.1101/19009076v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009076v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Epidemiology

"The development of competency frameworks in healthcare professions: a scoping review.","Background
Competency frameworks serve many roles including outlining characteristics of a competent workforce, to provide clarity to complex constructs, to facilitate professional mobility, and to help structure analysis, evaluation or assessment of professional expertise. Given these roles and their relevance in the health professions, we sought to understand the methods and strategies used in the development of existing competency frameworks.

Methods
The Arksey and O'Malley framework was applied to undertake this scoping review. Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, and ERIC) and three grey literature sources (greylit.org, Trove and Google Scholar) were searched using keywords related to competency frameworks. Studies of all types were included that described the development of a competency framework in a healthcare profession. Studies were screened for inclusion, and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Data synthesis was both quantitative and qualitative.

Results
Among 5,710 citations, 190 were selected for analysis. The majority of studies were conducted in medicine and nursing professions. Group techniques were utilised in 140 studies (74%), literature reviews were conducted in 112 (59%), and 81 (43%) outlined some form of stakeholder deliberation. We found a significant degree of diversity in methodological strategies, inconsistent adherence to existing guidance on the selection of methods, who was involved, and based on the variation we observed in timeframes, form, choice, sequence, combination, function, application and reporting of methods and strategies, there is no apparent gold standard or standardised approach to competency framework development.

Conclusions
This review observed significant variation within the conduct and reporting of the competency framework development process. Such variation is a cause for concern, potentially resulting in the development of frameworks that may not have captured the complexities of clinical practice, which are therefore of limited value to the profession, and may unwillingly create and legitimise artificial outcomes. The results of this review suggest there is a need for improved guidance in the process for developing and reporting competency frameworks.","/content/10.1101/19003475v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003475v1.full.pdf","2019-08-01","Medical Education

"Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder: symptomatic and syndromic thresholds and diagnostic operationalization","Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the most appropriate threshold for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) diagnosis and the impact of potential changes in diagnostic rules on prevalence levels in the community. 
Methods: Trained psychologists evaluated 3,562 adolescents from the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort with the Development and Well-Being Behavior Assessment (DAWBA). The clinical threshold was assessed in three stages: symptomatic, syndromic and clinical operationalization. The symptomatic threshold identified the response category in each DAWBA item which separates normative misbehavior from a clinical indicator. The syndromic threshold identified the number of irritable mood and outbursts needed to capture children with high symptom levels. Clinical operationalization compared the impact of AND/OR rules for combining irritable mood and outbursts on impairment and levels of psychopathology. 
Results: At the symptomatic threshold, most irritable mood items were normative in their lowest response categories and clinically significant in their highest response categories. For outbursts some indicated a symptom even when present at only a mild level, while others did not indicate symptoms at any level. At the syndromic level, a combination of 2 out of 7 irritable mood and 3 out of 8 outburst indicators accurately captured a cluster of individuals with high level of symptoms. Analysis combining irritable mood and outbursts delineated non-overlapping aspects of DMDD, providing support for the OR rule in clinical operationalization. The best DMDD criteria resulted in a prevalence of 4%. 
Conclusions: Results provide information for initiatives aiming to provide data-driven and clinically-oriented operationalized criteria for DMDD.","/content/10.1101/19002436v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002436v1.full.pdf","2019-07-16","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Family history and polygenic risk of cardiovascular disease: independent factors associated with secondary cardiovascular manifestations in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy","Background: Family history (FHx) of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a risk factor for CVD and a proxy for cardiovascular heritability. Genetic studies have identified dozens of variants for CVD underscoring its heritable component. CVD variants have also been associated with atherosclerotic plaque composition. However, little is known about the influence of FHx or genetic burden on secondary cardiovascular events (sCVE).
Methods: We included 1,788 carotid endarterectomy patients from the Athero-Express Biobank. A weighted polygenic risk score for CAD including 1.7 million variants was calculated (MetaGRS). The composite endpoint of sCVE during three years follow-up included coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral events and cardiovascular death. We assessed the impact of FHx and MetaGRS on sCVE and carotid plaque composition. 
Results: Positive FHx was associated with a higher 3-year risk of sCVE independent of cardiovascular risk factors and MetaGRS (adjusted HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.07-1.82, p=0.013). Patients in the highest MetaGRS quintile had a higher 3-year risk of sCVE compared to the rest of the cohort independent of cardiovascular risk factors including FHx (adjusted HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.79, p=0.043), and their atherosclerotic plaques contained more fat (adjusted OR 1.59, 95%CI, 1.11-2.29, p=0.013) and more macrophages (OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.12-1.99, p=0.006).
Conclusion: In patients with severe atherosclerotic disease, both positive FHx and higher MetaGRS were independently associated with increased risk of sCVE. Moreover, higher MetaGRS was associated with vulnerable plaque characteristics. Future studies should unravel underlying mechanisms and focus on the added value of polygenic scores and family history in individual risk prediction for sCVE.","/content/10.1101/19006718v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006718v1.full.pdf","2019-09-18","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"A target product profile for electronic clinical decision support algorithms combined with point-of-care diagnostic test results to support evidence-based decisions during patient consultations by health workers","Health workers in low-resource settings often lack the support and tools to follow evidence-based clinical recommendations for diagnosing, treating and managing sick patients. Digital technologies, by combining patient health information and point of care diagnostics with evidence-based clinical protocols, can help improve the quality of care, the rational use of resources (humans, diagnostics and medicines) and save patient lives. The development of a target product profile for electronic clinical decision support algorithms (CDSAs) aimed at guiding preventive or curative consultations, and that integrate diagnostic test results will help align developer and implementer processes and specifications with the needs of end-users, in terms of quality, safety, performance and operational functionality. To identify characteristics for a CDSA, experts from academia, research institutions, and industry as well as policy makers with expertise in diagnostic and CDSA development, and implementation in LMICs were convened. Experts discussed the critical characteristics of a draft TPP which was revised and finalised through a Delphi process to facilitate consensus building. Experts were in overwhelming agreement that, given that CDSAs provide patients' management recommendations, the underlying clinical algorithms should be available in human readable format and evidence-based. Whenever possible, the algorithm output should take into account pre-test disease probabilities, diagnostic likelihood ratios of clinical or laboratory predictors and disease probability thresholds to test and to treat.  Validation processes should at a minimum ensure the CDSA are implementing faithfully the evidence-based algorithm they are based on (internal validation through clinical association and analytical validation). Additionally, clinical validation, bringing practice evidence about the impact of the CDSA use on health outcomes, was recognized as a good to have. The CDSAs should be designed to fit within clinic workflows, connectivity challenges and high volume settings. Data collected through the tool should conform to local patient privacy regulations and international data standards.","/content/10.1101/19008433v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008433v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Public and Global Health

"AN OPEN-SOURCE DATASET OF ANTI-VEGF THERAPY IN DIABETIC MACULAR OEDEMA PATIENTS OVER FOUR YEARS & THEIR VISUAL OUTCOMES","PURPOSE: To evaluate visual acuity (VA) outcomes of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in diabetic macular oedema (DMO).
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, electronic medical records for all patients undergoing intravitreal injections (IVI) in a tertiary referral centre between March 2013 and October 2018 were analysed. Treatment response in terms of visual acuity outcomes were reported for all eyes over a 4-year observation period.
RESULTS: Our cohort includes 2616 DMO eyes of 1965 patients over 48 months. Cox proportional hazards modelling identified injection number (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.18), male gender (HR = 1.13), and baseline VA (HR = 1.09) as independent predictors to reach a favorable visual outcome of more than 70 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. Half of our cohort reached 70 letters 1.9 months after starting anti-VEGF therapy. Of those that reached 70 letters, 50% fell below 70 by 14.7 months.
CONCLUSION: To date, this is the largest single center cohort study and over the longest observation period reporting on real-life outcomes of anti-VEGF in DMO. We have made a pseudonymised version of our dataset available on an open-source data repository as a resource for all clinical researchers globally.","/content/10.1101/19009332v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009332v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Ophthalmology

"The escape from Alzheimer's disease underlies genetic variants involved into immune response and endocytosis pathways","The risk to develop and escape Alzheimer's disease (AD) is influenced by a constellation of genetic variants, each associated with specific molecular pathways. Different pathways may differentially contribute to the modification of the AD-risk. We studied the molecular mechanisms that explain the extreme ends of the cognitive spectrum by comparing pathway-specific polygenic risk scores (pathway-PRS) in individuals with AD and those who escaped AD until old age.
We used 29 genetic variants associated with AD to calculate pathway-PRS for five major pathways involved in AD. We developed an integrative framework that allows multiple genes to associate with a variant, and multiple pathways to associate with a gene. We studied pathway-PRS in patients with AD (N=1,909), population controls (N=1,654), and cognitively healthy centenarians who escaped AD (N=293). Last, we estimated the contribution of each pathway to the genetic risk of AD in the general population. 
All pathway-PRS significantly associated with the modification of AD-risk (p<0.05). The pathway that contributed the most was -amyloid metabolism (32%), driven mainly by APOE variants. After excluding APOE variants, all pathway-PRS associated with increased AD-risk (p<0.05), while specifically immune response (p=3.1x10-3) and endocytosis (p=3.8x10-4) associated with escaping AD. These pathways were the main contributors to the genetic risk of AD (41.3% and 21.4%, respectively), and their effect on escaping AD was larger or comparable to that of developing AD. 
Our work suggests that immune response and endocytosis might be involved in general neuro-protective functions, and highlights the need to study these pathways, next to -amyloid metabolism.","/content/10.1101/19009464v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009464v1.full.pdf","2019-10-18","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Increasing Firearm Deaths in The Youngest Americans: Ecologic Correlation with Firearm Prevalence","Background:   In the United States (U.S.), the overall death rate in 1-4 year-olds had been steadily declining until 2014, after which it ceased to improve. To understand this trend reversal, we investigated trends in the causes of their deaths.
Methods:  Mortality data were obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, firearm background check data from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and civilian firearm prevalence from the Small Arms Survey. 
Findings:  In 1-4 year-olds, the rate of fatal firearm accidents during 2002-2017 increased exponentially at an average rate of 6.0%/year (p=0.0003). The rate of increase was the greatest of all evaluable causes of death in the age group. Both the rate increase and most recent absolute rate in firearm accidental deaths in young children were correlated with the concurrent corresponding rate of firearm background checks (p = 0.0002 and 0.003, respectively). Also, the firearm accidental death rate in countries with high civilian firearm prevalence was correlated with the number of guns per civilian population (p=0.002).
Interpretation:   Prior to 2004, the childhood firearm death rate did not increase during the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.  Since 2014 when the Ban ended, the steadily increasing rate of sales and concomitant availability of, and access to, firearms in the U.S. has been associated with an increase in fatal firearm accidents in its youngest children.  The acceleration of firearm deaths and injuries among young Americans requires urgent, definitive solutions that address firearm prevalence.

"Geographic, environmental, and demographic correlates of central nervous system infections in Lao PDR (2003 through 2011): a retrospective secondary spatial analysis","Central nervous system (CNS) infections are important contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide, but the causative agents for ~50% patients are never identified. Here we present the results of a spatial analysis of CNS infections in Lao PDR (2003 through 2011). Hospitalizations for suspected CNS infection were recorded at Mahosot Hospital in Vientiane and tests for a large panel of pathogens were performed. All home villages were geocoded using patient records and official Lao PDR census data. The spatial distributions of CNS infections were analyzed by major diagnoses. Summary statistics and logistic regressions were used to test for associations between geographic, environmental, and demographic variables and diagnoses. Out of 1,065 patients, 450 (42%) were assigned a confirmed diagnosis. Japanese encephalitis virus ((JEV); n=94) and Cryptococcus spp. (n=70) were the most common infections. Patients undergoing diagnostic LP for suspected CNS infections lived closer to major roads than would be expected by chance alone. JEV was the most spatially dispersed, peaked in the rainy season and was most common among children. JEV patients came from villages that had higher surface flooding during the same month as admission and, in comparison to the home villages of other patients, came from villages at higher elevation. Cryptococcus spp. infections clustered near Vientiane and among adults.  Geographic and financial access to healthcare may explain the close proximity of these patients to major roads and also suggest that these hospital data vastly underestimate the true community burden of CNS infections. As Lao PDR is undergoing major developmental and environmental changes, the space-time distributions of the causative agents of CNS infection will also likely change. There is a major need for increased diagnostic abilities; increased access to healthcare, especially for rural populations; and for increased surveillance throughout the nation.","/content/10.1101/19005884v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005884v1.full.pdf","2019-09-11","Public and Global Health

"PathFlowAI: A Convenient High-Throughput Workflow for Preprocessing, Deep Learning Analytics and Interpretation in Digital Pathology","The diagnosis of disease often requires analysis of a biopsy. Many diagnoses depend not only on the presence of certain features but on their location within the tissue. Recently, a number of deep learning diagnostic aids have been developed to classify digitized biopsy slides. Clinical workflows often involve processing of more than 500 slides per day.  But, clinical use of deep learning diagnostic aids would require a preprocessing workflow that is cost-effective, flexible, scalable, rapid, interpretable, and transparent. Here, we present such a workflow, optimized using Dask and mixed precision training via APEX, capable of handling any patch-level or slide level classification and prediction problem.  The workflow uses a flexible and fast preprocessing and deep learning analytics pipeline, incorporates model interpretation and has a highly storage-efficient audit trail.  We demonstrate the utility of this package on the analysis of a prototypical anatomic pathology specimen, liver biopsies for evaluation of hepatitis from a prospective cohort.  The preliminary data indicate that PathFlowAI may become a cost-effective and time-efficient tool for clinical use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms.","/content/10.1101/19003897v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003897v1.full.pdf","2019-08-13","Pathology

"Examining the effect of smoking on suicidal ideation and attempts: A Mendelian randomisation study","Importance: Previous literature has demonstrated a strong association between cigarette smoking and suicide-related behaviours, characterised as ideation, plans, attempts and suicide related death. This association has not previously been examined in a causal inference framework and has important implications for suicide prevention strategies. 

Objective: We aimed to examine the evidence for an association between smoking behaviours (initiation, smoking status, heaviness, lifetime smoking) and suicidal thoughts or attempts by triangulating across observational and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses. 

Design: First, we estimated observational associations between smoking behaviours and suicidal thoughts or attempts using data from the UK Biobank cohort. Second, we conducted MR using both individual level and summary level methods. MR uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to reduce bias from residual confounding and reverse causation. 

Setting: The observational analysis and individual level MR were conducted using the UK Biobank, a cohort study that recruited from study centres across the UK between 2006 and 2010. Summary level MR analyses used summary data from previously published genome-wide association studies conducted in individuals of European ancestry.

Participants: 337,053 individuals from the UK Biobank aged from 39 to 70 years at recruitment (mean = 56.91 years, SD = 7.99 years) and 54% of the sample were female.

Exposures: Smoking initiation, smoking heaviness, smoking cessation and lifetime smoking. 

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. 
Results: Our observational analysis showed a relationship between smoking behaviour and suicidal behaviour, particularly between smoking initiation and suicidal attempts (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.91 to 2.26, p<0.001). The MR analysis and single SNP analysis, however, did not support this. Despite past literature showing a positive dose-response relationship our results showed no clear evidence for a causal effect of smoking on suicidal behaviours.

Conclusions and relevance: Our results suggest that, despite observed associations, there is no strong evidence for a causal effect of smoking behaviour on suicidal behaviour. Our evidence suggests that further research is needed into alternative risk factors for suicide which might make better intervention targets.","/content/10.1101/19007013v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007013v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Epidemiology

"Machine learning prediction of motor response after deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease","Introduction: Despite careful patient selection for subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS), some Parkinson's disease patients show limited improvement of motor disability. Non-conclusive results from previous prediction studies maintain the need for a simple tool for neurologists that reliably predicts postoperative motor response for individual patients. Establishing such a prediction tool facilitates the clinician to improve patient counselling, expectation management, and postoperative patient satisfaction.
Predictive machine learning models can be used to generate individual outcome predictions instead of correlating pre- and postoperative variables on a group level.
Methods: We developed a machine learning logistic regression prediction model which generates probabilities for experiencing weak motor response one year after surgery. The model analyses preoperative variables and is trained on 90 patients using a ten-fold cross-validation. We intentionally chose to leave out pre-, intra- and postoperative imaging and neurophysiology data, to ensure the usability in clinical practice. 
Weak responders (n = 27) were defined as patients who fail to show clinically relevant improvement on Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II, III or IV.
Results: The model predicts weak responders with an average area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 0.88 (standard deviation: 0.14), a true positive rate of 0.85 and a false positive rate of 0.25, and a diagnostic accuracy of 78%. The reported influences of the individual preoperative variables are useful for clinical interpretation of the model, but cannot been interpreted separately regardless of the other variables in the model.
Conclusion: The very good diagnostic accuracy of the presented prediction model confirms the utility of machine-learning based motor response prediction one year after STN DBS implantation, based on clinical preoperative variables.
After reproduction and validation in a prospective cohort, this prediction model holds a tremendous potential to be a supportive tool for clinicians during the preoperative counseling.","/content/10.1101/19006841v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006841v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Neurology

"Validation of Serum Neurofilaments as Prognostic & Potential Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers for ALS","Objective. Identify preferred neurofilament assays, and clinically validate serum NfL and pNfH as prognostic and potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers relevant to ALS therapy development. 

Methods. Prospective, multi-center, longitudinal observational study of patients with ALS (n=228), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS, n=20) and progressive muscular atrophy (PMA, n=11). Biological specimens were collected, processed and stored according to strict standard operating procedures (SOPs). Neurofilament assays were performed in a blinded manner by independent contract research organizations (CROs). 

Results. For serum NfL and pNfH measured using the Simoa assay, missing data (i.e. both technical replicates below the lower limit of detection (LLD) was not encountered. For the Iron Horse and Euroimmun pNfH assays, such missingness was encountered in ~4% and ~10% of serum samples respectively. Mean coefficients of variation (CVs) for pNfH in serum and CSF were ~4-5% and ~2-3% respectively in all assays. Baseline NfL concentration, but not pNfH, predicted the future ALSFRS-R slope and survival. Incorporation of baseline serum NfL into mixed effects models of ALSFRS-R slopes yields an estimated sample size saving of ~8%. Depending on the method used to estimate effect size, use of serum NfL as a pharmacodynamic biomarker, instead of the ALSFRS-R slope, yields significantly larger sample size savings. 

Conclusions. Serum NfL (Simoa assay) may be considered a clinically validated prognostic biomarker for ALS. Both serum NfL and pNfH (using the Simoa assay) have potential utility as pharmacodynamic biomarkers of treatment effect.","/content/10.1101/19002998v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002998v1.full.pdf","2019-08-03","Neurology

"Contribution of Marijuana Legalization to the U.S. Opioid Mortality Epidemic: Individual and Combined Experience of 27 States and District of Columbia","Background:   Prior studies of U.S. states as of 2013 and one state as of 2015 suggested that marijuana availability reduces opioid mortality (marijuana protection hypothesis). This investigation tested the hypothesis with opioid mortality trends updated to 2017 and by evaluating all states and the District of Columbia (D.C.).
Methods:   Opioid mortality data obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used to compare opioid death rate trends in each marijuana-legalizing state and D.C. before and after medicinal and recreational legalization implementation and their individual and cumulative aggregate trends with concomitant trends in non-legalizing states. The Joinpoint Regression Program identified statistically-significant mortality trends and when they occurred.
Results:   Of 23 individually evaluable legalizing jurisdictions, 78% had evidence for a statistically-significant acceleration of opioid death rates after medicinal or recreational legalization implementation at greater rates than their pre-legalization rate or the concurrent composite rate in non-legalizing states. All four jurisdictions evaluable for recreational legalization had evidence (p <0.05) for subsequent opioid death rate increases, one had a distinct acceleration, and one a reversal of prior decline. Since 2009-2012, when the cumulative-aggregate opioid death rate in the legalizing jurisdictions was the same as in the non-legalizing group, the legalizing group's rate accelerated increasingly faster (p=0.009). By 2017 it was 67% greater than in the non-legalizing group (p<0.05).
Conclusions:   The marijuana protection hypothesis is not supported by recent U.S. data on opioid mortality trends. Instead, legalizing marijuana appears to have contributed to the nation's opioid mortality epidemic.","/content/10.1101/19007393v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007393v1.full.pdf","2019-09-27","Public and Global Health

"Surgical Intervention for Paediatric Infusion-Related Extravasation Injury: A Systematic Review","Objectives
This systematic review aims to assess the quality of literature supporting surgical interventions for paediatric extravasation injury and to determine and summarize their outcomes.

Methods
We performed a systematic review by searching Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to February 2019. All studies other than case reports were eligible for inclusion if the population was younger than 18 years old, there was a surgical intervention aimed at treating extravasation injury and they reported on outcomes. Risk of bias was graded according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study quality assessment tools.

Results
26 studies involving 728 children were included. One before and after study and 25 case series. Extravasation injuries were mainly confined to skin and subcutaneous tissues but severe complications were also encountered, including amputation (one toe and one below elbow). Of the surgical treatments described, the technique of multiple puncture wounds and instillation of saline and/or hyaluronidase was the most commonly used. However, there were no studies in which its effectiveness was tested against another treatment or a control and details of functional and aesthetic outcomes were generally lacking. 

Conclusion
There is a lack of high quality evidence to support treatment of extravasation injury in children. A definitive trial of extravasation injuries, or a centralized extravasation register using a universal grading scheme and core outcome set with adequate follow up, are required to provide evidence to guide clinician decision-making.","/content/10.1101/19008664v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19008664v1.full.pdf","2019-10-08","Pediatrics

"Using Hierarchical Clustering to Explore Patterns of Deprivation Among English Local Authorities","Background
The English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is widely used as a measure of deprivation of geographic areas in analyses of health inequalities between places. However, similarly ranked areas can differ substantially in the underlying subdomains and indicators that are used to calculate the IMD score. These subdomains and indicators contain a richer set of data that might be useful for classifying local authorities. Clustering methods offer a set of techniques to identify groups of areas with similar patterns of deprivation. This could offer insights into areas that face similar challenges.

Methods
Hierarchical agglomerative (i.e. bottom-up) clustering methods were applied to sub-domain scores for 152 upper-tier local authorities. Recent advances in statistical testing allow clusters to be identified that are unlikely to have arisen from random partitioning of a homogeneous group. The resulting clusters are described in terms of their subdomain scores and basic geographic and demographic characteristics.

Results
Five statistically significant clusters of local authorities were identified. These clusters represented local authorities that were: 
(i) 	Most deprived, predominantly urban;
(ii)	Least deprived, predominantly rural;
(iii) 	Less deprived, rural;
(iv)	Deprived, high crime, high barriers to housing; and
(v)	Deprived, low education, poor employment, poor health.

Conclusion
Hierarchical clustering methods identify five distinct clusters that do not correspond closely to quintiles of deprivation. These methods can be used to draw on the richer set of information contained in the IMD subdomains and may help to identify places that face similar challenges, and places that appear similar in terms of IMD scores, but that face different challenges.","/content/10.1101/19006957v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006957v1.full.pdf","2019-09-18","Public and Global Health

"Implementation of a specialist pneumonia intervention nurse service significantly lowers mortality for community acquired pneumonia","Objectives: Evaluate clinical outcomes associated with implementing a specialist pneumonia intervention nursing (SPIN) service, to improve adherence with BTS guidelines for hospitalised community acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Design: Retrospective cohort study, comparing periods before (2011-13) and after (2014-16) SPIN service implementation. 

Setting: Single NHS trust across two hospital sites in Leicester City, England

Participants: 13,496 adult (aged =16) admissions to hospital with a primary diagnosis of CAP 

Interventions: The SPIN service was set up in 2013/2014 to provide clinical review of new CAP admissions; assurance of guidelines adherence; delivery of CAP clinical education and clinical follow up after discharge.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were proportions of CAP cases receiving antibiotic treatment within 4 hours of admission and change in crude in-hospital mortality rate. Secondary outcomes were adjusted mortality rate and length of stay (LOS).

Results: The SPIN service reviewed 38% of CAP admissions in 2014-16. 82% of these admissions received antibiotic treatment in <4 hours (68.5% in the national audit). Compared with the pre-SPIN period, there was a significant reduction in both 30-day (OR=0.77 [0.70-0.85], p<0.0001) and in-hospital mortality (OR=0.66 [0.60-0.73], p<0.0001) after service implementation, with a review by the service having the largest independent 30-day mortality benefit (HR=0.60 [0.53-0.67], p<0.0001). There was no change in LOS (median 6 days).

Conclusions: Implementation of a SPIN service improves adherence with BTS guidelines and achieves significant reductions in CAP associated mortality. This enhanced model of care is low cost, highly effective and readily adoptable in secondary care.","/content/10.1101/19007336v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007336v1.full.pdf","2019-10-05","Respiratory Medicine

"The prevalence of scabies, pyoderma and other communicable dermatoses in the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau","Background: Skin diseases represent a significant public health problem in most low and middle income settings. Nevertheless, there is a relative paucity of high-quality epidemiological data on the prevalence of these conditions. Materials/methods: We conducted two cross-sectional population-based skin-surveys of children (6 months to 9 years old) in the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau during the dry season (February-March 2018) and the wet season (June-July 2018). Following a period of training,  a nurse performed a standardised examination for communicable dermatoses for each participant. We calculated the prevalence of each skin condition and investigated demographic associations. Results: 1062 children were enrolled in the dry season survey of whom 318 (29.9%) had at least one skin diseases.  The most common diagnosis was tinea capitis (154/1062, 14.5% - 95% CI 12.5-16.8%) followed by tinea corporis (84/1062, 7.9% - 95% CI 6.4-9.7%), pyoderma (82/1062, 7.7% - 95% CI 6.2-9.5%) and scabies (56/1062. 5.2% - 95%CI 4.0 - 6.8%). 320 children were enrolled in the wet season survey of whom 121 (37.8%) had at least one skin problem. Tinea capitis remained the most common diagnosis (79/320, 24.7% - 95% CI 20.1 - 29.9%), followed by pyoderma (38/320, 11.9% - 95% CI 8.6-16.1%), tinea corporis (23/320, 7.2% - 95% 4.7 - 10.7%) and scabies (6/320, 1.9% - 95% CI 0.8-4.2%). Conclusions: Our study, which utilised robust population-based cluster random sampling methodology,  demonstrates the substantial disease burden caused by common communicable dermatoses in this setting.

"Assessing the impact of data aggregation in model predictions of HAT transmission and control activities","Since the turn of the century, the global community has made great progress towards the elimination of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Elimination programs, primarily relying on screening and treatment campaigns, have also created a rich database of HAT epidemiology. Mathematical models calibrated with these data can help to fill remaining gaps in our understanding of HAT transmission dynamics, including key operational research questions such as whether integrating vector control with current intervention strategies is needed to achieve HAT elimination. Here we explore, via an ensemble of models and simulation studies, which aspects of the available data and level of data aggregation, such as separation by disease stage, would be most useful for better understanding transmission dynamics and improving model reliability in making future predictions of control and elimination strategies.","/content/10.1101/19005991v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005991v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Multimorbidity and consultation time: a systematic review","Background: Multimorbidity (MM) is one of the major challenges currently facing health systems at the international level and tends to occupy a considerable part of the daily activity of physicians around the world. It is important to think about the medical approach to dealing with patients with multimorbidity in order to maximize the quality of the services provided by national health services, and thus to secure a better quality of life for these patients. Information about the time spent in a medical consultation with a patient with MM criteria is essential to better organize and deliver healthcare. As far as we know, no previous review has summarized the data relating to how having MM affects the length of the average consultation time.
Objective: To review all the experimental observational studies that describe the impact of having MM on the average time of a medical consultation.
Methods: This systematic review was performed considering the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The systematic online searches of the Embase and PubMed databases were undertaken, from January 2000 to August 2018. The studies were independently screened by two reviewers to decide which ones met the inclusion criteria. (Kappa=0.84 and Kappa=0.82). Differing opinions were solved by a third person. This systematic review included people with MM criteria as participants (two or more chronic conditions in the same individual). The type of outcome included was explicitly defined - the length of medical appointments with patients with MM criteria. Any strategies aiming to analyse the impact of MM on the average consultation time were considered. The comparator used was the length of time of medical appointment for patients without MM criteria. Experimental and observational studies were included.
Results: Of 85 articles identified, only 1 observational study was included. The study shows that there is a clear trend for patients with MM criteria to have longer consultations than patients without MM criteria (p<0.001). The global quality of this study was considered Satisfactory.
Conclusions: It is imperative to study the consultation time spent on patients with MM criteria. Finding a longer consultation time indicates it is important to rethink and adapt GPs lists and time planning to be able to give better medical care to patients with MM by providing agendas that have specific times set aside for these patients and allocating enough time for every task required.","/content/10.1101/19007328v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007328v1.full.pdf","2019-09-23","Primary Care Research

"The impact of reactive mass vaccination campaigns on measles outbreaks in the Katanga region, Democratic Republic of Congo","The Katanga region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been struck by repeated epidemics of measles, with large outbreaks occurring in 2011 and 2015. In many of the affected health zones, reactive mass vaccination campaigns were conducted in response to the outbreaks. Here, we attempted to determine how effective the vaccination campaigns in 2015 were in curtailing the ongoing outbreak. We further sought to establish whether the risk of large measles outbreaks in different health zones could have been determined in advance to help prioritise areas for vaccination campaign and speed up the response. In doing so, we first attempted to identify factors that could have been used in 2015 to predict in which health zones the greatest outbreaks would occur. Administrative vaccination coverage was not a good predictor of the size of outbreaks in different health zones. Vaccination coverage derived from surveys, on the other hand, appeared to give more reliable estimates of health zones of low vaccination coverage and, consequently, large outbreaks. On a coarser geographical scale, the provinces most affected in 2015 could be predicted from the outbreak sizes in 2011. This, combined with the fact that the vast majority of reported cases were in under-5 year olds, would suggest that there are systematic issues of undervaccination. If this was to continue, outbreaks would be expected to continue to occur in the affected health zones at regular intervals, mostly concentrated in under-5 year olds. We further used a model of measles transmission to estimate the impact of the vaccination campaigns, by first fitting a model to the data including the campaigns and then re-running this without vaccination. We estimated the reactive campaigns to have reduced the size of the overall outbreak by approximately 21,000 (IQR: 16,000-27,000; 95% CI: 8300-38,000) cases. There was considerable heterogeneity in the impact of campaigns, with campaigns started earlier after the start of an outbreak being more impactful.

"The impact of reactive mass vaccination campaigns on measles outbreaks in the Katanga region, Democratic Republic of Congo","The Katanga region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been struck by repeated epidemics of measles, with large outbreaks occurring in 2011 and 2015. In many of the affected health zones, reactive mass vaccination campaigns were conducted in response to the outbreaks. Here, we attempted to determine how effective the vaccination campaigns in 2015 were in curtailing the ongoing outbreak. We further sought to establish whether the risk of large measles outbreaks in different health zones could have been determined in advance to help prioritise areas for vaccination campaign and speed up the response. In doing so, we first attempted to identify factors that could have been used in 2015 to predict in which health zones the greatest outbreaks would occur. Administrative vaccination coverage was not a good predictor of the size of outbreaks in different health zones. Vaccination coverage derived from surveys, on the other hand, appeared to give more reliable estimates of health zones of low vaccination coverage and, consequently, large outbreaks. On a coarser geographical scale, the provinces most affected in 2015 could be predicted from the outbreak sizes in 2011. This, combined with the fact that the vast majority of reported cases were in under-5 year olds, would suggest that there are systematic issues of undervaccination. If this was to continue, outbreaks would be expected to continue to occur in the affected health zones at regular intervals, mostly concentrated in under-5 year olds. We further used a model of measles transmission to estimate the impact of the vaccination campaigns, by first fitting a model to the data including the campaigns and then re-running this without vaccination.

"EventEpi
A Natural Language Processing Framework for Event-Based Surveillance","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 60% of all outbreaks are detected using informal sources.
  In many public-health institutes, including the WHO and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), dedicated groups of epidemiologists sift through numerous articles and newsletters to detect relevant events. This media screening is one important part of event-based surveillance (EBS). Reading the articles, discussing their relevance, and putting key information into a database is a time-consuming process. To support EBS, but also to gain insights into what makes an article and the event it describes relevant, we developed a natural-language-processing framework for automated information extraction and relevance scoring. First, we scraped relevant sources for EBS as done at RKI (WHO Disease Outbreak News and ProMED) and automatically extracted the articles' key data: disease, country, date, and confirmed-case count. For this, we performed named entity recognition in two steps: EpiTator, an open-source epidemiological annotation tool, suggested many different possibilities for each. We trained a naive Bayes classifier to find the single most likely one using RKI's EBS database as labels. Then, for relevance scoring, we defined two classes to which any article might belong: The article is <em>relevant</em> if it is in the EBS database and <em>irrelevant</em> otherwise. We compared the performance of different classifiers, using document and word embeddings. Two of the tested algorithms stood out: The multilayer perceptron performed best overall, with a precision of 0.19, recall of 0.50, specificity of 0.89, F1 of 0.28, and the highest tested index balanced accuracy of 0.46. The support-vector machine, on the other hand, had the highest recall (0.88) which can be of higher interest for epidemiologists. Finally, we integrated these functionalities into a web application called EventEpi where relevant sources are automatically analyzed and put into a database. The user can also provide any URL or text, that will be analyzed in the same way and added to the database.
  Each of these steps could be improved, in particular with larger labeled datasets and fine-tuning of the learning algorithms. The overall framework, however, works already well and can be used in production, promising improvements in EBS.

"Risk factors for heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction among Medicare beneficiaries: Applications of completing risks analysis and gradient boosted model.","Background: The differential impact of various demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions on development of heart failure (HF) with preserved (pEF) and reduced ejection fraction (rEF) is not well studied among the elderly. 
Methods and Results: Using Medicare claims data linked to electronic health records, we conducted an observational cohort study of individuals = 65 years of age without HF. A Cox proportional hazards model accounting for competing risk of HFrEF and HFpEF incidence was constructed. A gradient boosted model (GBM) assessed the relative influence (RI) of each predictor in development of HFrEF and HFpEF. Among 138,388 included individuals, 9,701 developed HF (IR= 20.9 per 1,000 person-year). Males were more likely to develop HFrEF than HFpEF (HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.81-2.37 vs. 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02-1.20, P for heterogeneity < 0.01). Atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension had stronger associations with the risk of HFpEF (HR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.80-2.26 and 1.66, 95% CI: 1.23-2.22) while cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction were more strongly associated with HFrEF (HR = 4.37, 95% CI: 3.21-5.97 and 1.94, 95% CI: 1.23-3.07). Age was the strongest predictor across all HF subtypes with RI from GBM >35%. Atrial fibrillation was the most influential comorbidity for development of HFpEF (RI = 8.4%) while cardiomyopathy was most influential for HFrEF (RI = 20.7%). 
Conclusions: These findings of heterogeneous relationships between several important risk factors and heart failure types underline the potential differences in the etiology of HFpEF and HFrEF.","/content/10.1101/19003509v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003509v1.full.pdf","2019-08-01","Epidemiology

"A Hybrid Machine Learning Framework to Predict Early Risk of Mortality in Paralytic Ileus Patients using Electronic Health Records.","Background and Objective: Paralytic Ileus (PI) is the pseudo-obstruction of the intestine secondary to intestinal muscle paralysis. PI is caused by several reasons such as overuse of medications, spinal injuries, inflammation, abdominal surgery, etc. We have developed an early
mortality prediction framework that can help intensivist, surgeons, and other medical professionals to optimize clinical management for PI patients in terms of optimal treatment strategy and resource planning.
Methods: We used a publicly available ICU database called MIMIC III v1.4, extracted patients that had paralytic ileus as a primary diagnosis over the age of 18 years old. We developed the FLAIM Framework a two-phase model (Phase I: Statistical testing and Phase II: Machine Learning application) that compared to traditional methods of machine learning. We used five different machine learning algorithms to test the validity of our Framework. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework by comparing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, and area under the curve (AUC) for each model.
Results: The most considerable improvement in AUC of 7.78% was observed due to the application of the proposed FLAIM method. Additionally, almost for all the machine learning models, an increase in accuracy was also found. With the FLAIM framework, we recorded an
accuracy of 81.30% and AUC of 81.38% under the support vector machine (with RBF kernel) model in predicting mortality during a hospital stay for the PI patients.
Discussion: Our results show promising clinical outcome prediction and application for individual patients admitted to the ICU with paralytic ileus after the first 24 hours of admission.","/content/10.1101/19006254v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006254v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine

"Natural Language Processing for Mimicking Clinical Trial Recruitment in Critical Care: A Semi-automated Simulation Based on the LeoPARDS Trial","Clinical trials often fail on recruiting an adequate number of appropriate patients. Identifying eligible trial participants is a resource-intensive task when relying on manual review of clinical notes, particularly in critical care settings where the time window is short. Automated review of electronic health records has been explored as a way of identifying trial participants, but much of the information is in unstructured free text rather than a computable form. We developed an electronic health record pipeline that combines structured electronic health record data with free text in order to simulate recruitment into the LeoPARDS trial. We applied an algorithm to identify eligible patients using a moving 1-hour time window, and compared the set of patients identified by our approach with those actually screened and recruited for the trial. We manually reviewed clinical records for a random sample of additional patients identified by the algorithm but not identified for screening in the original trial. Our approach identified 308 patients, of whom 208 were screened in the actual trial. We identified all 40 patients with CCHIC data available who were actually recruited to LeoPARDS in our centre. The algorithm identified 96 patients on the same day as manual screening and 62 patients one or two days earlier. Analysis of electronic health records incorporating natural language processing tools could effectively replicate recruitment in a critical care trial, and identify some eligible patients at an earlier stage. If implemented in real-time this could improve the efficiency of clinical trial recruitment.","/content/10.1101/19005603v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005603v1.full.pdf","2019-09-09","Health Informatics

"AETIONOMY, a Cross-Sectional Study Aimed at validating a new taxonomy of Neurodegenerative Diseases: Study design and subject characteristics","Background: Although advances in the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) have led to improvements in classification and diagnosis and most importantly to new therapies, the unmet medical needs remain significant due to high treatment failure rates. The AETIONOMY project funded by the Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI) aims at using multi-OMICs and bioinformatics to identify new classifications for NDDs based on common molecular pathophysiological mechanisms in view of improving the availability of personalised treatments. 

Objectives: The purpose of the AETIONOMY cross-sectional study is to validate novel patient classification criteria provided by these tools.

Methods: This was a European multi centre, cross-sectional, clinical study conducted at 6 sites in 3 countries. Standardised clinical data, biosamples from peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, skin biopsies, and data from a multi-OMICs approach were collected in patients suffering from Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, as well as healthy controls. 

Results: From September 2015 to December 2017 a total of 421 participants were recruited including 95 Healthy Controls. Nearly 1,500 biological samples were collected. The study achieved its objective with respect to Parkinson disease (PD) recruitment, however it was unable to recruit many new Alzheimer Disease (AD) patients. Overall, data from 413 evaluable subjects (405 PD and 8 AD) are available for analysis. PD patients and controls were well matched with respect to age (mean 63.4 years), however, close gender matching was not achieved. Approximately half of all PD patients and one At-Risk subject were taking dopamine agonists; rates of Levodopa usage were slightly higher (~60%). Median MDS-UPDRS Part III Scores (OFF state) ranged from 45 (SD 18) in those with Genetic PD to 2 (SD 3) in Healthy Controls. The standardised methodologies applied resulted in a high-quality database with very few missing data.

Conclusion: This is one of the collaborative multi-OMICs studies in individuals suffering from PD and AD involving a control group. It is expected that the integration of data will provide new biomarker-led descriptions of clusters of patient subgroups.","/content/10.1101/19004804v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004804v1.full.pdf","2019-09-05","Neurology

"Childhood immune imprinting to influenza A shapes birth year-specific risk during seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 epidemics","Across decades of co-circulation in humans, influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have caused seasonal epidemics characterized by different age distributions of infection and mortality. H3N2 causes the majority of cases in high-risk elderly cohorts, and the majority of overall deaths, whereas H1N1 causes incidence shifted towards young and middle-aged adults, and fewer deaths. These contrasting age profiles may result from differences in childhood exposure to H1N1 and H3N2 or from differences in evolutionary rate between subtypes. Here we analyze a large epidemiological surveillance dataset to test whether childhood immune imprinting shapes seasonal influenza epidemiology, and if so, whether it acts primarily via immune memory of a particular influenza subtype or via broader immune memory that protects across subtypes. We also test the impact of evolutionary differences between influenza subtypes on age distributions of infection. Likelihood-based model comparison shows that narrow, within-subtype imprinting is the strongest driver of seasonal influenza risk. The data do not support a strong effect of evolutionary rate, or of broadly protective imprinting that acts across subtypes. Our findings emphasize that childhood exposures can imprint a lifelong immunological bias toward particular influenza subtypes, and that these cohort-specific biases shape epidemic age distributions. As a result, newer and less ""senior"" antibody responses acquired later in life do not provide the same strength of protection as responses imprinted in childhood.  Finally, we project that the relatively low mortality burden of H1N1 may increase in the coming decades, as cohorts that lack H1N1-specific imprinting eventually reach old age.","/content/10.1101/19001834v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001834v1.full.pdf","2019-07-13","Epidemiology

"Hidden heterogeneity and its influence on dengue vaccination impact","The CYD-TDV vaccine was recently developed to combat dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease that afflicts millions of people each year throughout the tropical and subtropical world. Its rollout has been complicated by recent findings that vaccinees with no prior exposure to dengue virus (DENV) experience an elevated risk of severe disease in response to their first DENV infection subsequent to vaccination. As a result of these findings, guidelines for use of CYD-TDV now require serological screening prior to vaccination to establish that an individual does not fall into this high-risk category. These complications mean that the public health impact of CYD-TDV vaccination is expected to be higher in areas with higher transmission. One important practical difficulty with tailoring vaccination policy to local transmission contexts is that DENV transmission is spatially heterogeneous, even at the scale of neighborhoods or blocks within a city. This raises the question of whether models based on data that average over spatial heterogeneity in transmission could fail to capture important aspects of CYD-TDV impact in spatially heterogeneous populations. We explored this question with a deterministic model of DENV transmission and CYD-TDV vaccination in a population comprised of two communities with differing transmission intensities. Compared to the full model, a version of the model based on the average of the two communities failed to capture benefits of targeting the intervention to the high-transmission community, which resulted in greater impact in both communities than we observed under even coverage. In addition, the model based on the average of the two communities substantially overestimated impact among vaccinated individuals in the low-transmission community. In the event that the specificity of serological screening is not high, this result suggests that models that ignore spatial heterogeneity could overlook the potential for harm to this segment of the population.","/content/10.1101/19006783v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006783v1.full.pdf","2019-09-16","Epidemiology

"The consistent burden in published estimates of delirium occurrence in medical inpatients over four decades: a systematic review and meta-analysis study","Introduction
Delirium is associated with a wide range of adverse patient safety outcomes. We sought to identify if trends in healthcare complexity were associated with changes in reported delirium in adult medical patients in the general hospital over the last four decades. 

Methods
We used identical criteria to a previous systematic review, including studies using DSM and ICD-10 criteria for delirium diagnosis. Random effects meta-analysis pooled estimates across studies, meta-regression estimated temporal changes, funnel plots assessed publication bias.

Results
Overall delirium occurrence was 23% (95% CI 19%-26%) (33 studies). There was no change between 1980-2019, nor was case-mix (average age of sample, proportion with dementia) different. There was evidence of increasing publication bias over time. 

Discussion
The incidence and prevalence of delirium in hospitals appears to be stable, though publication bias may mask true changes. Nonetheless, delirium remains a challenging and urgent priority for clinical diagnosis and care pathways.","/content/10.1101/19005165v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005165v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","Geriatric Medicine

"Framework for rational donor selection in fecal microbiota transplant clinical trials","Early clinical successes are driving enthusiasm for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the transfer of healthy gut bacteria through whole stool, as emerging research is linking the microbiome to many different diseases. However, preliminary trials have yielded mixed results and suggest that heterogeneity in donor stool may play a role in patient response. Thus, clinical trials may fail because an ineffective donor was chosen rather than because FMT is not appropriate for the indication. Here, we describe a conceptual framework to guide rational donor selection to increase the likelihood that FMT clinical trials will succeed. We argue that the mechanism by which the microbiome is hypothesized to be associated with a given indication should inform how donors are selected for FMT trials, categorizing these mechanisms into four disease models and presenting associated donor selection strategies. We next walk through examples based on previously published FMT trials and ongoing investigations to illustrate how donor selection might occur in practice. Finally, we show that typical FMT trials are not powered to discover individual taxa mediating patient responses, suggesting that clinicians should develop targeted hypotheses for retrospective analyses and design their clinical trials accordingly. Moving forward, developing and applying novel clinical trial design methodologies like rational donor selection will be necessary to ensure that FMT successfully translates into clinical impact.","/content/10.1101/19000307v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000307v1.full.pdf","2019-07-03","Gastroenterology

"Genome-wide association and multi-omic analyses reveal new mechanisms for Heart Failure","Heart failure is a major medical and economic burden in the healthcare system affecting over 23 million people worldwide. Although recent pedigree studies estimate heart failure heritability around 26%, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have had limited success in explaining disease pathogenesis. We conducted the largest meta-analysis of heart failure GWAS to-date and replicated our findings in a comparable sized cohort to identify one known and two novel variants associated with heart failure. Leveraging heart failure sub-phenotyping and fine-mapping, we reveal a putative causal variant found in a cardiac muscle specific regulatory region that binds to the ACTN2 cardiac sarcolemmal gene and affects left ventricular adverse remodeling and clinical heart failure in response to different initial cardiac muscle insults. Via genetic correlation, we show evidence of broadly shared heritability between heart failure and multiple musculoskeletal traits. Our findings extend our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying heart failure.","/content/10.1101/19006510v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006510v1.full.pdf","2019-09-17","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Does the early nutritional environment and in utero HIV exposure, in the absence of infant infection, impact infant development?","Malnutrition and infectious disease often coexist in socially inequitable contexts. Malnutrition in the perinatal period adversely affects offspring development and lifelong non-communicable disease risk. Less is known about the effects of infectious disease exposure during critical windows of development and health, and links between in utero HIV-exposure in the absence of neonatal infection, perinatal nutritional environments, and infant development are poorly defined. In a pilot study at Kalafong Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa, we aimed to understand how early nutritional environments and in utero HIV-exposure, without infection (HIV exposed uninfected [HEU] infants) may influence infant development. Mother-infant dyads were recruited after delivery and followed until 12 weeks postpartum. Maternal reports of food insecurity were associated with lower maternal nutrient intakes 12 weeks postpartum, and in infants, with lower Apgar scores (five minutes), higher brain-to-body weight ratio at birth and 12 weeks of age, and attainment of fewer large movement and play activities milestones at 12 weeks of age, irrespective of maternal HIV status. Reports of worry about food runout were associated with increased risk of stunting for HEU, but not unexposed, uninfected infants. Our findings suggest that food insecurity, in a vulnerable population, adversely affects maternal nutritional status and infant development. In utero exposure to HIV may further perpetuate these effects, which has implications for early child development and lifelong human capital.","/content/10.1101/19003871v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003871v1.full.pdf","2019-08-12","HIV/AIDS

"Influenza-associated mortality for different causes of death during the 2010-2011 through the 2014-2015 influenza seasons in Russia","Background: There is limited information on the volume of influenza-associated mortality in Russia.

Methods: Using previously developed methodology (Goldstein et al., Epidemiology 2012), we regressed the monthly rates of mortality for respiratory causes, circulatory cause, and for certain infectious and parasitic diseases (available from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat)) linearly against the monthly proxies for the incidence of influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B (obtained using data from the Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza (RII) on levels of ILI/ARI consultations and the percent of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B), adjusting for the baseline rates of mortality not associated with influenza circulation and temporal trends.

Results: For the 2010/11 through the 2014/15 seasons, influenza circulation was associated with an average annual 3662 (95% CI (2487,4836)) deaths for respiratory causes, 9558 (2280,16836) deaths for circulatory causes, and 343 (63,624) deaths for certain infectious and parasitic diseases, with influenza B making a substantial contribution to the last two categories of deaths. The largest numbers of both respiratory and circulatory deaths (5220 (3407,7033) and 16380 (3907,28853) correspondingly) were estimated during the 2014/15 season.

Conclusions: Influenza circulation is associated with a substantial mortality burden in Russia, particularly for circulatory deaths. Those results support the potential utility of influenza vaccination (with the role played by influenza B pointing to the benefit of quadrivalent influenza vaccines), as well as of administration of antiviral drugs for older individuals and individuals with certain underlying health conditions during periods of active influenza circulation.","/content/10.1101/19005470v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005470v1.full.pdf","2019-09-09","Epidemiology

"The Mezurio smartphone application: Evaluating the feasibility of frequent digital cognitive assessment in the PREVENT dementia study","Background: Smartphones may significantly contribute to the detection of early cognitive decline at scale by enabling remote, frequent, sensitive, economic assessment. Several prior studies have sustained engagement with participants remotely over a period of a week; extending this to a period of a month would clearly give greater opportunity for measurement. However, as such study durations are increased, so too is the need to understand how participant burden and scientific value might be optimally balanced.
Objectives: We explore the 'little but often' approach to assessment employed by the Mezurio app, interacting with participants every day for over a month. We aim to understand whether this extended remote study duration is feasible, and which factors might promote sustained participant engagement over such study durations. 
Methods: Thirty-five adults (aged 40-59 years) with no diagnosis of cognitive impairment were prompted to interact with the Mezurio smartphone app platform for up to 36 days, completing short, daily episodic memory tasks in addition to optional executive function and language tests. A subset (n=20) completed semi-structured interviews focused on their experience using the app. 
Results: Average compliance with the schedule of learning for subsequent memory test was 80%, with 88% of participants still actively engaged by the final task. Thematic analysis of participants' experiences highlighted schedule flexibility, a clear user-interface, and performance feedback as important considerations for engagement with remote digital assessment.
Conclusions: Despite the extended study duration, participants demonstrated high compliance with the tasks scheduled and were extremely positive about their experiences. Long durations of remote digital interaction are therefore definitely feasible, but only when careful attention is paid to the design of the user experience.","/content/10.1101/19005124v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005124v1.full.pdf","2019-09-04","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"The Implementation, Diagnostic Yield and Clinical Outcome of Genetic Testing on an Inpatient Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Service","Objective: Diagnostic genetic testing is recommended for children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).  However, many children with NDDs do not receive genetic testing.  One approach to improve access to genetic services for these patients is to offer testing on the inpatient child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) service. 
Methods: We implemented systematic genetic testing on an inpatient CAP service by providing medical genetics education to CAP fellows. We compared the genetic testing rates pre- and post-education. We compared the diagnostic yield to previously published studies and the demographics of our cohort to inpatients who received genetic testing on other clinical services. We assessed rates of outpatient genetics follow-up post-discharge.
Results: The genetic testing rate on the inpatient CAP service was 1.6% (2/125) before the educational intervention and 10.7% (21/197) afterwards (OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.015-0.58, p = 0.0015). Diagnostic yield for patients on the inpatient service was 4.3% (1/23), lower than previously reported. However, 34.8% (8/23) of patients had variants of unknown significance (VUSs). 39.1% (9/23) of children who received genetic testing while inpatients were underrepresented minorities, compared to 7.7% (1/13) of patients who received genetic testing on other clinical services (OR = 0.14, CI = 0.0027-1.24, p = 0.057).  43.5% of patients were lost to outpatient genetics follow-up. 
Conclusion: Medical genetics education for fellows on an inpatient CAP service can improve genetic testing rates. Genetic testing for inpatients may primarily identify VUSs instead of well-known NDD risk variants. Genetic testing on the inpatient CAP service may improve access to genetic services for underrepresented minorities, but assuring outpatient follow-up can be challenging.","/content/10.1101/19004846v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004846v1.full.pdf","2019-08-17","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

We developed a model-inference system to infer the transmission dynamics of measles in the affected community and assess the impact of vaccination campaigns implemented during the outbreak, based on monthly age-grouped and overall incidence data reported from Oct 2018 to July 2019. The model-inference system accounted for differential mixing among 5 age-groups (<1, 1-4, 5-17, 18-49, and 50+ years), routine two-dose vaccination, vaccination campaigns, and observational errors including underreporting. However, it did not account for other public health interventions such as post-exposure prophylaxis and school closure. 

Approximately 25% of 1-4 year-olds were susceptible when the outbreak began, enabling measles to spread predominantly in this age group in the initial months. Early vaccination campaigns were able to lower this susceptibility and contain measles spread by Dec 2018.  However, an increase in infectious contact among 1-4 year-olds, likely facilitated by parents hosting ""measles parties"" to expose unvaccinated children, appeared to rekindle and aggravate the outbreak in early 2019. Consequently, 1-4 year-olds not only had the largest number of infections (275/642 or 42.8%, as of Aug 6, 2019), but also appeared to cause the largest number of infections in other age groups, including around half of the 100 infections in infants. 

The model estimated that, without the implemented vaccination campaigns, there would be 6078 (95% CI: 5, 8433) infections and 452 (95% CI: 0, 628) hospitalizations, including 94 (95% CI: 0, 130) needing intensive care, during the observed outbreak period. In addition, it would largely affect infants under 1 too young to receive the first dose of vaccine and young children under 4, with over 10 times more infections and hospitalizations in both age groups than reported. 

Conclusions:
These findings highlight the importance of vaccination in protecting children from measles and public health education to reduce activities that unnecessarily expose children to the disease.","/content/10.1101/19005298v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19005298v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","Epidemiology

"Institutional behaviour in the success of the Clean India programme","Objective: To understand how the Indian Government succeeded in transforming toilet provision in India.
Design: Qualitative interviews analysed using a theory of change grounded in Behaviour Centred Design 
Setting: National capital, 4 states and 4 districts in India
Participants: 17 actors in the Government Clean India programme
Results: The Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) claims to have improved the coverage of toilets in rural India from 39% to over 90% of households between 2014 and the end of 2018. From interviews with relevant actors we constructed a theory of change for the programme in which high-level political support and disruptive leadership changed environments in districts, which led to psychological changes in district officials, which, in turn, led to changed behaviour concerning sanitation programming. The setting by the Prime Minister of the ambitious goal to eliminate open defecation by the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi (October 2019) galvanised government bureaucracy, while early success in 100 flagship districts reduced the scepticism of government employees, a cadre of 500 young professionals placed in districts imparted new ideas and energy, social and mass media was used to engage and motivate the public and key players, and new norms of ethical behaviour were demonstrated by leaders. As a result, district officials engaged emotionally with the programme and felt pride at their achievements in ridding villages of open defecation. 
Conclusions: Governments seeking to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of universal access to safe sanitation can emulate the success of Indias Swachh Bharat Mission.","/content/10.1101/19004689v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004689v1.full.pdf","2019-08-29","Public and Global Health

"Earliest infections predict the age distribution of seasonal influenza A cases","Seasonal variation in the age distribution of influenza A cases suggests that factors other than age shape susceptibility to infection. Here, we ask whether these differences can be explained in part by protection conferred by childhood influenza infection, which has lasting impacts on immune responses to influenza and protection against novel influenza A subtypes (phenomena known as original antigenic sin and immune imprinting, respectively). Fitting a statistical model to 11 years of data from studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in Marshfield, Wisconsin, we find that primary infection appears to reduce the risk of medically attended infection with that subtype throughout life and shapes the distribution of seasonal influenza A cases.   This effect is particularly strong for H1N1 (67% reduction in medically attended H1N1 infection risk, CI 55-78%) compared to H3N2 (34% reduction in medically attended H3N2 infection risk, CI 18-47%).  Additionally, we find evidence that influenza VE varies with both age and birth year, but not with the imprinting subtype per se. This suggests that VE may be sensitive to particular exposure histories. The ability to predict age-specific risk might improve forecasting models and vaccination strategies to combat seasonal influenza.","/content/10.1101/19001875v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001875v1.full.pdf","2019-07-14","Epidemiology

"Neuroimaging biomarkers differentiate Parkinson disease with and without cognitive impairment and dementia","Mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease places a high burden on patients and is likely a precursor to Parkinson disease-related dementia. Studying the functional connectivity and morphology of subcortical structures within basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits may uncover neuroimaging biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction in PD. We used an atlas-based seed region-of-interest approach to investigate resting-state functional connectivity of important subdivisions of the caudate nucleus, putamen and thalamus, between controls (n = 33), cognitively unimpaired Parkinson disease subjects (n = 33), Parkinson disease subjects with mild cognitive impairment (n = 22) and Parkinson disease subjects with dementia (n = 17). We then investigated how the morphology of the caudate, putamen and thalamus structures and differed between groups. Results indicate that cognitively unimpaired Parkinson disease subjects, compared to controls, display increased functional connectivity of the dorsal caudate, anterior putamen and mediodorsal thalamic subdivisions with areas across the frontal lobe, as well as reduced functional connectivity of the dorsal caudate with posterior cortical and cerebellar regions. Compared to controls, Parkinson disease subjects with mild cognitive impairment demonstrated reduced functional connectivity of the mediodorsal thalamus with midline nodes within the executive-control network. Compared to subjects with mild cognitive impairment, subjects with dementia demonstrated reduced functional connectivity of the mediodorsal thalamus with the posterior cingulate cortex, a key node within the default-mode network. Extensive volumetric and surface-based contraction was found in Parkinson disease subjects with dementia. Our research demonstrates how functional connectivity of the caudate, putamen and thalamus are implicated in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease, with mild cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease associated with a breakdown in functional connectivity of the mediodorsal thalamus with para- and posterior cingulate regions of the brain.","/content/10.1101/19002147v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002147v1.full.pdf","2019-07-16","Radiology and Imaging

"Medal: a patient similarity metric using medication prescribing patterns","Patient similarity offers an exciting potential to improve our understanding of treatment patterns. Medication history is a valuable source of information given the clinical considerations taken during the physician's prescription process. However, available similarity methods do not consider timeliness of event occurrence in the longitudinal care of patients.

In this observational cohort study, we propose an event alignment algorithm, Medal, which uses a dynamic programming approach for pairwise alignment of medication histories. To test our algorithm, we obtained the medication usage from a cohort of patients with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). After calculating a distance metric with Medal, we compute a hierarchical clustering and explore the most appropriate number of clusters. 

We identified four clusters in PANS with distinct medication usage histories, driven primarily by penicillin. We foresee that our algorithm could be used to identify clusters in other syndromes treated with multiple medication regimens.","/content/10.1101/19004440v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004440v1.full.pdf","2019-08-17","Health Informatics

"Personality profiles differ between patients with epileptic seizures and patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures","Aim: The primary aim of the study was to determine whether patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) have different personality profiles compared to patients with epileptic seizures (ES). The secondary aim was to determine whether any such personality differences could be used to efficiently screen for PNES in clinical settings.

Background: PNES and ES are often difficult to differentiate, leading to incorrect or delayed diagnosis. While the current gold-standard investigation is video-EEG monitoring (VEM), it is resource intensive and not universally available. Although some research has investigated the differential psychological profiles of PNES and ES patients, most studies have focused on symptoms of psychopathology. The lack of research using modern personality models in PNES and ES presents a gap in knowledge that this study aimed to address.

Methods: A retrospective collection of data was conducted on patients who completed the NEO-Five Factor Inventory questionnaire during a VEM admission to the Royal Melbourne Hospital between 2002-2017. Patients were classified as either ES or PNES based on clinical consensus diagnosis. For patients with ES, type of epilepsy and laterality of seizure focus were also recorded. Personality differences were investigated using Bayesian linear mixed effects models. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also performed to generate sensitivities and specificities of individual personality scores.

Results: 305 patients were included in the study. The 'openness to experience' domain was the only personality factor demonstrating strong evidence for a group difference (BF10 = 21.55, d = -0.43 [95% CI -0.71, -0.17]), with patients in the PNES group having higher scores compared to the ES group. Within the openness to experience domain, only the 'aesthetic interest' facet showed evidence for a group difference (BF10 = 7.98, d = -0.39 [95% CI -0.66, -0.12]). ES patients had lower scores on these measures compared to the normal population, while PNES patients did not. Both openness to experience and aesthetic interest, however, showed poor sensitivities (53%, 46% respectively) and specificities (69%, 46% respectively) for classifying PNES and ES patients. There were no differences between personality profiles in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) and non-TLE patients, or in laterality in TLE.

Conclusion: Patients with ES exhibit lower openness to experience and aesthetic interest compared to patients with PNES and compared to the general population. Despite these differences, the relatively low sensitivity and specificity of these instruments suggests their use is limited in a clinical setting. Nevertheless, these findings open up new avenues of research using modern personality models to further understand patients with epilepsy and related presentations.","/content/10.1101/19002717v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002717v1.full.pdf","2019-07-20","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Distinct psychopathology profiles in patients with epileptic seizures compared to non-epileptic psychogenic seizures","Objective: Similarities in clinical presentations between epileptic seizures (ES) and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) produces a risk of misdiagnosis. Video-EEG monitoring (VEM) is the diagnostic gold standard, but involves significant cost and time commitment, suggesting a need for more efficient screening tools.

Methods: 628 patients were recruited from an inpatient VEM unit; 293 patients with ES, 158 with PNES, 31 both ES and PNES, and 146 non-diagnostic. Patients completed the SCL-90-R, a standardised 90-item psychopathology instrument. Bayesian linear models were computed to investigate whether SCL-90-R domain scores or the overall psychopathology factor p differed between groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were computed to investigate the PNES classification accuracy of each domain score and p. A machine learning algorithm was also used to determine which subset of SCL-90-R items produced the greatest classification accuracy.

Results: Evidence was found for elevated scores in PNES compared to ES groups in the symptom domains of anxiety (b = 0.47, 95%HDI = [0.10, 0.80]), phobic anxiety (b = 1.32, 95%HDI = [0.98, 1.69]), somatisation (b = 0.84, 95%HDI = [0.49, 1.20]), and the general psychopathology factor p (b = 1.35, 95%HDI = [0.86, 1.82]). While somatisation scores produced the highest classification accuracy (AUC = 0.74, 95%CI = [0.69, 0.79]), it was not sufficient for use as a screening or diagnostic test. The genetic algorithm produced a 6-item subset from the SCL-90-R, however on cross-validation these items did not display improved classification accuracy (AUC = 0.73, 95%CI = [0.64, 0.82]).

Significance: Our study demonstrated differences between ES and PNES patients using a validated psychopathology instrument. These differences were not large enough to provide sufficient classification accuracy. However, these findings suggest that elevations in self-reported somatisation, general anxiety, or phobic anxiety should raise suspicion of PNES in clinical settings.","/content/10.1101/19003038v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003038v1.full.pdf","2019-07-29","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Genetic risk of obesity as a modifier of associations between neighbourhood environment and body mass index: an observational study of 335,046 UK Biobank participants","Background: There is growing recognition that recent global increases in obesity are the product of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. However, in gene-environment studies of obesity, ""environment"" usually refers to individual behavioural factors that influence energy balance, while more upstream environmental factors are overlooked. We examined gene-environment interactions between genetic risk of obesity and two neighbourhood characteristics likely to be associated with obesity (proximity to takeaway/fast-food outlets and availability of physical activity facilities) and genetic risk of obesity. 
Methods: We used data from 335,046 adults aged 40-70 in the UK Biobank cohort to conduct a population-based cross-sectional study of interactions between neighbourhood characteristics and genetic risk of obesity, in relation to BMI. Proximity to a fast-food outlet was defined as distance from home address to nearest takeaway/fast-food outlet, and availability of physical activity facilities as the number of formal physical activity facilities within one kilometre of home address. Genetic risk of obesity was operationalised by 91-SNP and 69-SNP weighted genetic risk scores, and by six individual SNPs considered separately. Multivariable, mixed effects models with product terms for the gene-environment interactions were estimated. 
Results: After accounting for likely confounding, the association between proximity to takeaway/fast-food outlets and BMI was stronger among those at increased genetic risk of obesity, with evidence of an interaction with polygenic risk scores (P=0.018 and P=0.028 for 69-SNP and 91-SNP scores, respectively) and in particular with a SNP linked to MC4R (P=0.009), a gene known to regulate food intake. We found very little evidence of a gene-environment interaction for availability of physical activity facilities.  
Conclusions: Individuals at an increased genetic risk of obesity may be more sensitive to exposure to the local fast-food environment.  Ensuring that neighbourhood residential environments are designed to promote a healthy weight may be particularly important for those with greater genetic susceptibility to obesity","/content/10.1101/19004671v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004671v1.full.pdf","2019-08-20","Epidemiology

"Increased functional connectivity of thalamic subdivisions in patients with Parkinson's disease","Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 2-3% of the population over the age of 65 with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra impacting the functioning of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. The precise role played by the thalamus is unknown, despite its critical role in the functioning of the cerebral cortex, and the abnormal neuronal activity of the structure in PD. Our objective was to more clearly elucidate how functional connectivity and morphology of the thalamus are impacted in PD (n = 32) compared to Controls (n = 20). To investigate functional connectivity of the thalamus we subdivided the structure into two important regions-of-interest, the first with putative connections to the motor cortices and the second with putative connections to prefrontal cortices. We then investigated potential differences in the size and shape of the thalamus in PD, and how morphology and functional connectivity relate to clinical variables. Our data demonstrate that PD is associated with increases in functional connectivity between motor subdivisions of the thalamus and the supplementary motor area, and between prefrontal thalamic subdivisions and nuclei of the basal ganglia, anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, as well as the anterior and paracingulate gyri. These results suggest that PD is associated with increased functional connectivity of subdivisions of the thalamus which may be indicative alterations to basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry.","/content/10.1101/19002139v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002139v1.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Radiology and Imaging

"Rationalising neurosurgical head injury referrals: The development and implementation of the Liverpool Head Injury Tomography Score (Liverpool HITS) for mild traumatic brain injury","Objectives:
To develop and implement a radiological scoring system to define a surgically significant mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), stratify neurosurgical referrals and improve communication between referral centres and neurosurgical units.
Design:
Retrospective single centre case-control analysis of ten continuous months of mild TBI referrals.
Setting:
A major tertiary neurosurgery centre in England, UK.
Participants:
All neurosurgical referrals with a mild TBI (GCS 13-15) during the period of 1st January to 30th October 2017 were eligible for the study. 1248 patients were identified during the study period, with 1444 being included in the final analysis.
Interventions:
All patients CT head results from the referring centres were scored retrospectively using the scoring system and stratified according to their mean score, and if they were accepted for transfer to the neurosurgical centre or managed locally.
Main outcome measure:
Determine the discriminatory and diagnostic power, sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system for predicting a surgically significant mild TBI.
Results:
Most patients referred were male (59.4%, N=681), with a mean age of 69 years (SD=21.1). Of the referrals to the neurosurgical centre, 17% (n=195) were accepted for transfer and 83% (n=946) were not accepted. The scoring system was 99% sensitive and 51.9% specific for determining a surgically significant TBI. Diagnostic power of the model was fair with an area under the curve of 0.79 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.82). The score identified 495 (52.2%) patients in ten months of referrals that could have been successfully managed locally without neurosurgical referral if the scoring system was correctly used at the time of injury.
Conclusion:
The Liverpool Head Injury Tomography Score (HITS) score is a CT based scoring system that can be used to define a surgically significant mild TBI. The scoring system can be easily used by multiple healthcare professionals, has high sensitivity, will reduce neurosurgical referrals, and could be incorporated into local, regional and national head injury guidance.","/content/10.1101/19004499v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004499v1.full.pdf","2019-08-17","Surgery

"Why Westerners Are Dissatisfied: A Cross-Sectional Study Identifying State-Level Factors Associated with Variation in Private Health Insurance Satisfaction","Importance: Large regional variations in consumer satisfaction with private health insurance plans have been observed, but the factors driving this variation are unknown.
Objective: To identify explanatory state-level and insurance family-level predictors of satisfaction with private health insurance. 
Design: Cross-sectional study examining regional and state variations in consumer health insurance plan satisfaction using National Committee for Quality Assurance data from 2015to 2018, state-level health data and parent insurance family.
Setting: US Population
Participants: Privately insured individuals.
Exposure: One of 2176 private health insurance plans.
Main Outcome: Consumer satisfaction with the health insurance plan on a 0-5 scale.
RESULTS: Consumer satisfaction with health insurance was consistently lowest in the West(p<0.0001). Lower private health insurance plan satisfaction was associated with the percentage of the population without a place of usual medical care, the percentage of the state population that is Hispanic, and the percentage of the population reporting any mental illness. Factors associated with increasing insurance satisfaction included higher healthcare spending per capita, a higher number of for-profit beds per capita, and an increased cancer death rate. Increased consumer satisfaction was associated with the Kaiser and Anthem insurance plan families.
Conclusions and Relevance: State and insurer family factors are predictive of private health insurance plan satisfaction. Potentially modifiable factors include access to primary care, healthcare spending per capita, and numbers of for-profit hospital beds. This information will help consumers hold insurance providers accountable to provide higher quality and more desirable coverage and provide actionable items to improve health insurance satisfaction.","/content/10.1101/19004762v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004762v1.full.pdf","2019-08-16","Health Policy

"Accuracy of Medical Billing Data Against the Electronic Health Record in the Measurement of Colorectal Cancer Screening Rates","Objective: Administrative healthcare data are an attractive source of secondary analysis because of their potential to answer population-health questions. Although these datasets have known susceptibilities to biases, the degree to which they can distort measurements like cancer screening rates are not widely appreciated, nor are their causes and possible solutions. 
Methods: Using a billing code database derived from our institution's electronic health records (EHR), we estimated the colorectal cancer screening rate of average-risk patients aged 50-74 seen in primary care or gastroenterology clinic in 2016-2017. 200 records (150 unscreened, 50 screened) were sampled to quantify the accuracy against manual review. 
Results: Out of 4,611 patients, an analysis of billing data suggested a 61% screening rate.  Manual review revealed a positive predictive value of 96% (86-100%), negative predictive value of 21% (15-29%), and a corrected screening rate of 85% (81-90%). Most false negatives occurred due to exams performed outside the scope of the database - both within and outside of our institution - but 21% of false negatives fell within the database's scope. False positives occurred due to incomplete exams and inadequate bowel preparation. Reasons for screening failure include ordered but incomplete exams (48%), lack of or incorrect documentation by primary care (29%) including incorrect screening intervals (13%), and patients declining screening (13%).
Conclusions: Although analytics on administrative data are commonly 'validated' by comparison to independent datasets, comparing our naive estimate to the CDC estimate (~60%) would have been misleading. Therefore, regular data audits using the complete EHR are critical to improve screening rates and measure improvement.","/content/10.1101/19004598v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19004598v1.full.pdf","2019-08-13","Health Informatics

"Mediterranean Diet improves thrombosis biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk individuals: a randomized controlled trial","Following a Traditional Mediterranean diet (TMD) decreases cardiovascular risk. However, its anti-thrombotic effects are unexplored. We aimed to assess whether this diet improved platelet, coagulation, and fibrinolysis-related biomarkers in cardiovascular risk subjects. In 358 random PREDIMED Study volunteers (Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea), we assessed: 1) 1-year effects on thrombosis of TMD, enriched in virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO; N=120) or nuts (TMD-Nuts; N=119), versus a low-fat diet (N=119), and 2) associations between 1-year biomarker changes and increments in Mediterranean Diet adherence and key food group intakes. TMD-Nuts attenuated pro-thrombotic status (P=0.029), whilst TMD-VOO did it in a marginally significant way (P=0.076). TMD-VOO decreased HDL-bound alpha1-antitrypsin levels (HDL pro-inflammatory/pro-thrombotic properties, P=0.034) and increased HDL platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase activity (P=0.024). TMD-Nuts diminished non-esterified fatty acid levels (P=0.034). Only the low-fat diet was associated with increased platelet factor-4 concentrations (P=0.012) and thrombin activation (higher prothrombin factor1+2 levels, P=0.003) versus baseline. 2-point TMD adherence increments were linked to 10.2 mg/dL fibrinogen decrements (P=0.011). 1-serving increments in vegetable intake were associated with platelet factor-4 concentration decreases (-9.21%, P=0.031). 1-portion increments in fruit and fatty fish consumption were linked to thrombin generation decrements (-7.72% -P=0.007- and -13.2% -P=0.046-, respectively). Increases in antithrombin levels were related to 1-serving increments in nut intake (+2.34%, P=0.033) and reductions in processed meat consumption (+2.00%, P=0.018). Finally, 1-portion decreases in processed meat intake were associated with reduced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels (-10.4%, P=0.008). Summarizing, TMD and its typical food items were associated with improved thrombosis biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk individuals.","/content/10.1101/19001909v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001909v1.full.pdf","2019-07-14","Nutrition

"Toward Automated Classification of Pathological Transcranial Doppler Waveform Morphology via Spectral Clustering","Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity waveforms acquired via Transcranial Doppler (TCD) can provide evidence for cerebrovascular occlusion and stenosis. Thrombolysis in Brain Ischemia (TIBI) flow grades are widely used for this purpose, but require subjective assessment by expert evaluators to be reliable. In this work we seek to determine whether TCD morphology can be objectively assessed using an unsupervised machine learning approach to waveform categorization. TCD beat waveforms were recorded at multiple depths from the Middle Cerebral Arteries of 106 subjects; 33 with CTA-confirmed Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO). From each waveform, three morphological variables were extracted, quantifying absolute peak onset, number/prominence of auxiliary peaks, and systolic canopy length. Spectral clustering identified groups implicit in the resultant three-dimensional feature space, with gap-statistic criteria establishing the optimal cluster number. We found that gap-statistic disparity was maximized at four clusters, referred to as flow types I, II, III, and IV. Types I and II were primarily composed of control subject waveforms, whereas types III and IV derived mainly from LVO patients. Cluster morphologies for types I and IV aligned clearly with Normal and Blunted TIBI flows, respectively. Types II and III represented commonly observed flow-types not delineated by TIBI, which nonetheless deviate quantifiably from normal and blunted flows. We conclude that important morphological variability exists beyond that currently quantified by TIBI in populations experiencing or at-risk for acute ischemic stroke, and posit that the observed flow-types provide the foundation for objective methods of real-time automated flow type classification.","/content/10.1101/19003236v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003236v1.full.pdf","2019-07-29","Neurology

"Leveraging multiple data types to estimate the true size of the Zika epidemic in the Americas","Since the first Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was confirmed in Brazil in May 2015, several hundred thousand cases have been reported across the Americas. This figure gives an incomplete picture of the epidemic, however, given that asymptomatic infections, imperfect surveillance, and variability in reporting rates complicate the interpretation of case report data. The infection attack rate (IAR)--defined as the proportion of the population that was infected over the course of the epidemic--has important implications for the longer-term epidemiology of Zika in the region, such as the timing, location, and likelihood of future outbreaks. To estimate the IAR and the total number of people infected, we leveraged multiple types of Zika case data from 15 countries and territories where subnational data were publicly available. Datasets included confirmed and suspected Zika cases in pregnant women and in the total population, Zika-associated Guillan-Barr syndrome cases, and cases of congenital Zika syndrome. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model with empirically-informed priors that leveraged the different case report types to simultaneously estimate national and subnational reporting rates, the fraction of symptomatic infections, and subnational IARs. In these 15 countries and territories, estimates of Zika IAR ranged from 0.084 (95% CrI: 0.067-0.096) in Peru to 0.361 (95% CrI: 0.214-0.514) in Ecuador, with significant subnational variability in IAR for every country. Totaling these infection estimates across these and 33 other countries and territories in the region, our results suggest that 132.3 million (95% CrI: 111.3-170.2 million) people in the Americas have been infected by ZIKV since 2015. These estimates represent the most extensive attempt to date to determine the size of the Zika epidemic in the Americas, and they offer an important baseline for assessing the risk of future Zika epidemics in this region.","/content/10.1101/19002865v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002865v1.full.pdf","2019-07-24","Epidemiology

"Early detection of molecular disease progression by whole-genome circulating tumor DNA in advanced solid tumors","Purpose: Treatment response assessment for patients with advanced solid tumors is complex and existing methods of assessment require greater precision for early disease assessment. Current guidelines rely on imaging, which has limitations such as the long time required before treatment effectiveness can be determined. Serial changes in whole-genome (WG) circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were used to detect disease progression early in the treatment course. 

Methods: 97 patients with advanced cancer were enrolled, and blood was collected before and after initiation of a new treatment. Plasma cell-free DNA libraries were prepared for either WG or WG bisulfite sequencing. Longitudinal changes in the fraction of ctDNA were quantified to identify molecular progression or response in a binary manner. Study endpoints were agreement with first follow-up imaging (FUI) and stratification of progression-free survival (PFS).

Results: Patients with early molecular progression had shorter PFS (n=14; median 62d) compared to others (n=78; median 263d, HR 12.6 [95% confidence interval 5.8-27.3], log-rank P<10-10, 5 excluded from analysis). All cases with molecular progression were confirmed by FUI and molecular progression preceded FUI by a median of 40d. Sensitivity for the assay in identifying clinical progression was 54%, median 24d into treatment and specificity was 100%.

Conclusions: Molecular progression, based on ctDNA data, detected disease progression for cases on treatment with high specificity approximately 6 weeks before follow-up imaging. This technology may enable early course change to a potentially effective therapy, avoiding side effects and cost associated with cycles of ineffective treatment.","/content/10.1101/19002550v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002550v1.full.pdf","2019-07-24","Oncology

"Nonlinear biomarker interactions in conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's disease","The multi-faceted nature of Alzheimer's disease means that multiple biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-beta, tau, brain atrophy) may improve the tracking of disease progression and the prediction of health outcomes. However, the mechanisms relating these biomarkers to the disease are inter-related to a degree. Hence, optimally modelling the relationships between different Alzheimer's biomarker is warranted to reduce statistical uncertainty in predictions, to understand disease mechanisms, and to provide tools for clinical decision-making at the individual patient level.
Here, we used Gaussian Processes to model nonlinear interactions when combining biomarkers to predict Alzheimer's disease conversion in 48 mild cognitive impairment participants who progressed to Alzheimer's disease and 158 stable (over three years) people with mild cognitive impairment. Measures included: demographics, APOE4 genotype, CSF (amyloid-beta-42, total tau, phosphorylated tau), neuroimaging markers of amyloid-beta deposition ([18F]florbetapir) or neurodegeneration (hippocampal volume, brain-age). We examined: (i) the independent value each biomarker has in predicting conversion; and (ii) whether modelling nonlinear interactions between biomarkers improved prediction performance.
Despite the correlations between different biomarkers, our results show each measured added complementary information when predicting conversion to Alzheimer's disease. A linear model predicting MCI group (stable versus progressive) explained over half the variance in group (R2 = 0.51, P < 0.001), with the top independently-contributing biomarker being hippocampal volume (R2 = 0.13). 
Next, we compared the sensitivity of different models to progressive MCI: independent biomarker models, additive models (with no interaction terms), nonlinear interaction models. We observed a significant improvement (P < 0.001) for various two-way interaction models, with the best performing model including an interaction between amyloid-beta-PET and P-tau, while accounting for hippocampal volume (sensitivity = 0.77).
Our results showed that closely related biomarkers still contribute uniquely to the prediction of conversion, supporting the continued use of comprehensive biological assessments. However, our nonlinear interaction models suggest that for some patients, additional biomarkers may add little value (i.e., when hippocampal volume is high), but that for others (i.e., with low hippocampal volume) further invasive and expensive testing is warranted. Our results suggest that the interaction between hippocampal atrophy and amyloid-deposition influences progression to Alzheimer's disease over and above their independent contributions, to a moderate extent. Our Gaussian Processes framework enables visual examination of these nonlinear interactions, allowing projection of individual patients into biomarker 'space', providing a way to make personalise healthcare decisions or stratify subsets of patients for recruitment into trials of neuroprotective interventions.","/content/10.1101/19002378v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002378v1.full.pdf","2019-07-16","Neurology

"Population Structure Drives Differential Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Colonization Dynamics","Background: Using a model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) within an intensive care unit (ICU), we explore how differing hospital population structures impact these infection dynamics.
Methods: Using a stochastic compartmental model of an 18-bed ICU, we compared the rates of MRSA acquisition across three potential population structures: a Single Staff Type (SST) model with nurses and physicians as a single staff type, a model with separate staff types for nurses and physicians (Nurse-MD model), and a Metapopulation model where each nurse was assigned a group of patients. By varying the proportion of time spent with the assigned patient group (<U+03B3>) within the Metapopulation model, we explored whether simpler models may be acceptable approximations to more realistic patient-healthcare staff contact patterns. 
Results: The SST, Nurse-MD, and Metapopulation models had a mean annual number of cumulative MRSA acquisitions of 40.6, 32.2 and 19.6 respectively. All models were sensitive to the same parameters in the same direction, although the Metapopulation model was less sensitive. The number of acquisitions varied non-linearly by values of <U+03B3>, with values below 0.40 resembling the Nurse-MD model, while values above that converged toward the metapopulation structure. 
Discussion: The population structure of a modeled hospital has considerable impact on model results, with the SST model having more than double the acquisition rate of the more structured Metapopulation model. While the direction of parameter sensitivity remained the same, the magnitude of these differences varied, producing different infection rates across relatively similar populations. The non-linearity of the model's response to differing values of <U+03B3> suggests only a narrow space of relatively dispersed nursing assignments where simple model approximations are appropriate.
Conclusion: Simplifying assumptions around how a hospital population is modeled, especially assuming random mixing, may overestimate infection rates and the impact of interventions.","/content/10.1101/19002402v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002402v1.full.pdf","2019-07-15","Epidemiology

"Medication errors during simulated paediatric resuscitations: a prospective, observational human reliability analysis","Introduction: Medication errors during paediatric resuscitation are thought to be common. However, there is little evidence about the individual process steps that contribute to such medication errors in this context.
Objectives: To describe the incidence, nature and severity of medication errors in simulated paediatric resuscitations, and to employ human reliability analysis to understand the contributory role of individual process step discrepancies to these errors.
Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of simulated resuscitations subject to video micro-analysis, identification of medication errors, severity assessment and human reliability analysis in a large English teaching hospital. Fifteen resuscitation teams of two doctors and two nurses each conducted one of two simulated paediatric resuscitation scenarios. 
Results: At least one medication error was observed in every simulated case, and a large magnitude or clinically significant error in 11 of 15 cases. Medication errors were observed in 29% of 180 simulated medication administrations, 40% of which considered to be moderate or severe. These errors were the result of 884 observed discrepancies at a number of steps in the drug ordering, preparation and administration stages of medication use, 8% of which made a major contribution to a resultant medication error. Most errors were introduced by discrepancies during drug preparation and administration. 
Conclusions: Medication errors were common with a considerable proportion likely to result in patient harm. There is an urgent need to optimise existing systems and to commission research into new approaches to increase the reliability of human interactions during administration of medication in the paediatric emergency setting.","/content/10.1101/19001016v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001016v1.full.pdf","2019-06-28","Pediatrics

"Health workers experiences of coping with the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo health system: a qualitative study of variables of hospital activities on infection control practices in Kinshasa city","Background. Health workers play an important role during epidemics but there is limited research on hospital activities on infection control practices in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and how health workers can cope during a probable health epidemic in Kinshasa city. 
The 2019 Ebola Virus Disease epidemic evolve in alarming ways in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the recently  involvement of 2 cases to Uganda, a neighbouring country making this outbreak the most complex and high risk ever experienced by the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country struggles to control it against a backdrop of a health system that is already over-burdened. 
This paper explores the challenges of a contamination in the context of an Ebola outbreak that may face health workers and their coping strategies in thirteen hospitals of reference in Kinshasa hoping to educate or remember good practices for health workers in Kinshasa that is also available for health workers in the East Area of the country where actually the Ebola outbreak is spreading (North Kivu and Ituri). 
We provide early epidemiological information arising from the ongoing investigation of this outbreak and the unpublished data in the evaluation of the level of biosecurity (BS) in the emergency rooms and laboratories of 13 hospitals of reference of the capital city.

Methods
We classified cases as suspected, probable, or confirmed using national case definitions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministry of Public Health. We obtain data from the Ministry of Public Health that determined Uganda cases possible exposures in health zones.
We also estimated the Health workers experiences of coping with the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo health system. We used a qualitative study of variables of hospital activities on infection control practices in thirteen reference health facilities in Kinshasa. 
We used key informant interviews with health facility managers; and in depth interviews with health workers working in public and private reference hospitals in Kinshasa. With this intention, 20 parameters were the subject of the investigation.  In order to characterize the profile of these health facilities, the collected data were submitted, on the one hand, with the analysis in principal components, and, other hand, with the technique of ascending hierarchical.
Findings
The unidimensional analysis, led parameter by parameter, showed that the standards of BS were respected by at least 75 % of the health facilities for the 6 following parameters: (1) material of taking away of single use; (2) disinfection of material and the desk; (3) good lighting of the rooms; (4) not encumbered waiting room; (5) adequate conservation of the biological specimens and (6) regular emptying of the baskets. With the extreme, for 2 following parameters, the standards of BS were respected only by at most 25 % of the health facilities: (1) wearing of gloves by the health workers and (2) disinfection of the instruments of examination. The other parameters had obtained a note going from weak to bad.
Interpretation
The ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has similar epidemiological features to previous Ebola virus disease outbreak in Sierra Leone [1]. Early detection, rapid patient isolation, contact tracing, and the ongoing vaccination programme should sufficiently control the outbreak. The forecast of the number of health workers (119 cases) remember the contamination risk. The information presented, although preliminary, is essential in guiding the ongoing investigation and response to this outbreak. The health workforce is inadequate and ill-equipped to deal with an outbreak including limited national means for research support for 40 years by the Congolese government. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the research is not funded; researchers are struggling themselves, so without means, we did this qualitative study that began in a functional parasitology disease unit in the Kinshasa University Hospital headed by the late Pr. Dr. Paul Mulumba Madishala. 
Conclusions
With regard to the characterization of the profile of the hospitals in the field of the respect of the standards of BS, all the 20 parameters considered overall, this one showed that this profile went from excellent to poor. The Bondeko-Ngaliema-Monkole group has occupied the first rank, while the group Kintambo-King Baudouin-Ndjili-Makala occupied the other end of the scale; the other health facilities occupied an intermediate position. Among the 7 hospitals which were placed at the top of this classification of BS, 5 were massively subsidized by international NGO, which explains to a great extent their performances in one hand, another hand finding its explanation in the quality of their management. It is the case of Bondeko, Monkole, Kalembe-Lembe, St Joseph and Kingasani 2.

"The Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study: online recruitment into the largest recontactable study of depression and anxiety","Background: Anxiety and depression are common, debilitating and costly. These disorders are influenced by multiple risk factors, from genes to psychological vulnerabilities and environmental stressors but research is hampered by a lack of sufficiently large comprehensive studies. We are recruiting 40,000 individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety, with broad assessment of risks to facilitate future research.
Methods: The Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study (www.gladstudy.org.uk) recruits individuals with depression or anxiety into the NIHR Mental Health BioResource. Participants invited to join the study (via media campaigns) provide demographic, environmental and genetic data, and consent for medical record linkage and recontact.
Results: Online recruitment was effective; 41,892 consented and 26,877 participants completed the questionnaire by July 2019. Participants' questionnaire data identified very high rates recurrent depression, severe anxiety and comorbidity. Participants reported high rates of treatment receipt. The age profile of sample is biased toward young adults, with higher recruitment of females and the better educated, especially at younger ages.  
Discussion: This paper describes the study methodology and descriptive data for GLAD, which represents a large, recontactable resource that will enable future research into risks, outcomes and treatment for anxiety and depression.","/content/10.1101/19002022v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002022v1.full.pdf","2019-07-12","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Cardiac arrest outcomes after targeted temperature management with an esophageal cooling device","Objective: To assess the efficacy of an esophageal device to provide TTM (Target Temperature Management) post Cardiac Arrest. Design: A chart review of all patients treated with ETTM, following cardiac arrest.  Initial patient temperature, time to target, supplemental methods (water blankets, head wraps, or ice packs), and patient survival were extracted for analysis. Setting: Community Medical Center Intensive Care Unit. Patients: All patients receiving TTM via an esophageal device post Cardiac Arrest from August 2016 to November 2018. Interventions: TTM both cooling and warming via an esophageal device. Measurements and Results:  A total of 54 patients were treated from August 2016 to November 2018; 30 received ETM only, 22 received supplemental cooling, and 2 had treatment discontinued prior to reaching target due to recovery.  Target temperatures ranged from 32 to 36 degrees. The median time to target temperature for the entire cohort was 219 minutes (IQR 81-415).  For the cohorts without, and with, supplemental cooling modalities, the median time to attain target temperature was 128 minutes (IQR 71-334), and 285 minutes (IQR 204-660), respectively.  Survival to ICU discharge was 51.9% for the entire cohort. Conclusions:  ETM attains target temperature at a rate consistent with current guidelines and with similar performance to alternative modalities. This may provide a more cost-effective and approachable core cooling option to community hospitals that only use water blankets or other surface methods.","/content/10.1101/19001487v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001487v1.full.pdf","2019-07-12","Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine

"Disease overarching mechanisms that explain and predict outcome of patients with high cardiovascular risk: rationale and design of the Berlin Long-term Observation of Vascular Events (BeLOVE) study","Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature death worldwide. Effective and individualized treatment requires exact knowledge about both risk factors and risk estimation. Most evidence for risk prediction currently comes from population-based studies on first incident cardiovascular events. In contrast, little is known about the relevance of risk factors for the outcome of patients with established CVD or those who are at high risk of CVD, including patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, most studies focus on individual diseases, whereas less is known about disease overarching risk factors and cross-over risk.
Aim: The aim of BeLOVE is to improve short- and long-term prediction and mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular disease progression and outcomes in very high-risk patients, both in the acute as well as in the chronic phase, in order to provide the basis for improved, individualized management.
Study design: BeLOVE is an observational prospective cohort study of patients of both sexes aged >18 in selected Berlin hospitals, who have a high risk of future cardiovascular events, including patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute stroke (AS), acute heart failure (AHF), acute kidney injury (AKI) or type 2 diabetes with manifest target-organ damage. BeLOVE includes 2 subcohorts: The acute subcohort includes 6500 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI within 2-8 days after their qualifying event, who undergo a structured interview about medical history as well as blood sample collection. The chronic subcohort includes 6000 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI 90 days after event, and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and target-organ damage. These patients undergo a 6-8 hour deep phenotyping program, including detailed clinical phenotyping from a cardiological, neurological and metabolic perspective, questionnaires including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)as well as magnetic resonance imaging. Several biological samples are collected (i.e. blood, urine, saliva, stool) with blood samples collected in a fasting state, as well as after a metabolic challenge (either nutritional or cardiopulmonary exercise stress test). Ascertainment of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) will be performed in all patients using a combination of active and passive follow up procedures, such as on-site visits (if applicable), telephone interviews, review of medical charts, and links to local health authorities. Additional phenotyping visits are planned at 2, 5 and 10 years after inclusion into the chronic subcohort.
Future perspective: BeLOVE provides a unique opportunity to study both the short- and long-term disease course of patients at high cardiovascular risk through innovative and extensive deep phenotyping. Moreover, the unique study design provides opportunities for acute and post-acute inclusion and allows us to derive two non-nested yet overlapping sub-cohorts, tailored for upcoming research questions. Thereby, we aim to study disease overarching research questions, to understand crossover risk, and to find similarities and differences between clinical phenotypes of patients at high cardiovascular risk.","/content/10.1101/19001024v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001024v1.full.pdf","2019-06-27","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Public knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy and its associated factors in Debre Berhan, North Shoa, Amhara Region, Ethiopia, 2018/19. Community based cross sectional study","Introduction: Epilepsy is chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent derangement of the nervous system due to sudden excessive disorderly discharge of the cerebral neurons. People living with epilepsy continue to suffer from enacted or perceived stigma that is based on myths, misconceptions, and misunderstandings that have persisted for many years. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the community general knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy. Methods: Community based cross sectional study was conducted to assess public general knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy and its associated factors using structured pretested questionnaire. Data was entered into Epi data version 3.1 and transported to SPSS version 21 further analysis. Both Bivariable and Multivariable Logistic Regression was done to identify associated factors. Odds Ratios and their 95% Confidence interval was computed and variables with p value less than 0.05 was considered significantly associated factors.  Results: 596 study participants were participated with a response rate of 98%. Among the study participants 43.6 (95% CI: 39.6, 47.5) had poor knowledge and 41.3 (95% CI: 37.4, 45.1) had unfavorable attitude.  Being secondary education, marital status, witnessed seizure, and heard the term epilepsy were showed statistically significant association with poor knowledge about epilepsy. Level of education, low average monthly income, not witnessed seizure, not heard the term epilepsy and distant from health facility showed statically significant association with the unfavorable attitude. Conclusion: In this study, Debre Berhan communities were found to have deficits in terms of general knowledge and attitude about epilepsy; and it should be given due attention.","/content/10.1101/19001578v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001578v1.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Epidemiology

"Bayesian spatial modelling of childhood cancer incidence in Switzerland using exact point data: A nationwide study during 1985-2015.","Background: The aetiology of most childhood cancers is largely unknown. Spatially varying environmental factors such as traffic-related air pollution, background radiation and agricultural pesticides might contribute to the development of childhood cancer. We investigated the spatial variation of childhood cancers in Switzerland using exact geocodes of place of residence. Methods: We included 5,947 children diagnosed with cancer during 1985-2015 at age 0-15 from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We modelled cancer risk using log-Gaussian Cox processes and indirect standardization to adjust for age and year of diagnosis. We examined whether the modelled spatial variation of risk can be explained by ambient air concentration of NO2, natural background radiation, area-based socio-economic position (SEP), linguistic region, years of existing general cancer registration in the canton or degree of urbanization. Results: For all childhood cancers combined, the posterior median relative risk (RR), compared to the national level, varied by location from 0.83 to 1.13 (min to max). Corresponding ranges were 0.96 to 1.09 for leukaemia, 0.90 to 1.13 for lymphoma, and 0.82 to 1.23 for CNS tumours. The covariates considered explained 72% of the observed spatial variation for all cancers, 81% for leukaemia, 82% for lymphoma and 64% for CNS tumours. There was evidence of an association of background radiation and SEP with incidence of CNS tumours, (1.19;0.98-1.40) and (1.6;1-1.13) respectively. Conclusion: Of the investigated diagnostic groups, childhood CNS tumours show the largest spatial variation in Switzerland. The selected covariates only partially explained the observed variation of CNS tumours suggesting that other environmental factors also play a role.","/content/10.1101/19001545v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001545v1.full.pdf","2019-07-08","Epidemiology

Using this model, we simulated a large cohort of patients with various levels of RRF receiving either conventional high-flux hemodialysis or on-line hemodiafiltration. These simulations were used to estimate a novel population kinetic (PK) equation for RRF (PK-RRF) that was validated in an external public dataset of real patients. We assessed the performance of the resulting equation(s) against their ability to estimate urea clearance using cross-validation. Our equations derived entirely from computer simulations and advanced statistical modeling, and had extremely high discrimination (AUC 0.808 - 0.909) when applied to a human dataset of measurements of RRF. A clearance-based equation that utilized pre and post dialysis B2M measurements, patient weight, treatment duration and ultrafiltration had higher discrimination than an equation previously derived in humans. Furthermore, the derived equations appeared to have higher clinical usefulness as assessed by Decision Curve Analysis, potentially supporting decisions that for individualizing dialysis frequency in patients with preserved RRF.","/content/10.1101/19001222v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001222v1.full.pdf","2019-07-03","Nephrology

"Molecular profiling of neonatal dried blood spots reveals changes in innate and adaptive immunity following fetal inflammatory response","The fetal inflammatory response (FIR) increases the risk of perinatal brain injury, particularly in extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, < 28 weeks of gestation). One of the mechanisms contributing to such a risk is a postnatal intermittent or sustained systemic inflammation (ISSI) following FIR. The link between prenatal and postnatal systemic inflammation is supported by the presence of well-established inflammatory biomarkers in the umbilical cord and peripheral blood. However, the extent of molecular changes contributing to this association is unknown. Using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics, we profiled the transcriptome and proteome of archived neonatal dried blood spot (DBS) specimens from 21 ELGANs. Comparing FIR-affected and unaffected ELGANs, we identified 783 gene and 27 protein expression changes of 50% magnitude or more, and an experiment-wide significance level below 5% false discovery rate. These expression changes confirm the robust postnatal activation of the innate immune system in FIR-affected ELGANs and reveal an impairment of their adaptive immunity. In turn, the altered pathways provide clues about the molecular mechanisms triggering ISSI after FIR, and the onset of perinatal brain injury.","/content/10.1101/19000109v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000109v1.full.pdf","2019-06-25","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Proximal and distal factors predicting timely initiation of breastfeeding in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: In Ethiopia, the current coverage of timely initiation of breast feeding (TIBF) has fallen short of the National Health Sector Transformation Plan 2016-2020, National Nutrition Program 2016-2020 and WHO global target. This calls for the need to assess relevant proximal and distal factors that affect the rate of TIBF in Ethiopia. Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association between TIBF and educational status, household income, marital status, media exposure, and parity in Ethiopia. Methods: Databases used were PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, CINAHL and WHO Global health library, and key terms were searched using interactive searching syntax. It was also supplemented by manual searching. Observational studies published between September 2000 and March 2019 were included. The methodological quality of studies was examined using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cross-sectional studies. Data were extracted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) data extraction tool. To obtain the pooled odds ratio (OR), extracted data were fitted in a random-effects meta-analysis model. Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using Cochran Q test, tau2, and I2 statistics. Additional analysis conducted includes Jackknife sensitivity analysis, cumulative meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis. Results: Out of 553 studies retrieved, 25 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Almost all studies were conducted on mothers with newborn less than 23 months. Maternal educational status (OR = 1.82; p < 0.001; 95% CI = 1.35 - 2.45; I2 = 84.96%), paternal educational status (OR = 2.72; p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.49 - 4.97 I2 = 62.50%), income (OR = 1.16; p = 0.002; 95% CI = 1.05 - 1.27; I2 = 0.00%), marital status (OR = 1.39; p = 0.001; 95% CI = 1.14 - 1.69; I2 = 9.17%) and parity (OR = 1.39; p = 0.01; 95% CI = 1.07 - 1.81; I2 = 74.43%) were found to be significantly associated with TIBF. We also observed a direct dose-response relationship of TIBF with educational status and income. Conclusions: Proximal and distal factors significantly predicting TIBF practice in Ethiopia, which needs integrated intervention by health professionals and healthcare policymakers. Health education, counselling and peer education targeting parents at antenatal and postnatal periods are needed. It is also relevant to improve the economic power of women and promote gender equality.","/content/10.1101/19000497v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000497v1.full.pdf","2019-06-25","Nutrition

"Trends and variation in unsafe prescribing of methotrexate: a cohort study in English NHS primary care.","Objective
To describe trends and geographical variation in methotrexate prescribing that breaches national safety recommendations; deaths from methotrexate poisoning; and associated litigation.

Methods
A retrospective cohort study of English NHS primary care prescribing data, complemented by information obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. The main outcome measures were: (1) variation in ratio of breaching / adherent prescribing, geographically and over time, between General Practices and Clinical Commissioning Groups; (2) description of responses to FOI requests.

Results
Out of 7349 NHS General Practices in England, 1689 practices prescribed both 2.5mg and 10mg tablets to individual patients in 2017, breaching national guidance. In April 2018, 697 practices (at the 90th centile and above) prescribed at least 14.3% of all methotrexate as 10mg tablets, breaching national guidance. The 66 practices at the 99th percentile and above gave at least 52.4% of all prescribed methotrexate in the form of 10 mg tablets. The prescribing of 10mg tablets has fallen over 7 years, with 10mg tablets as a proportion of all methotrexate tablets falling from 9.1% to 3.4%. 21 deaths caused by methotrexate poisoning have been reported from 1993-2017. 

Conclusions
The prevalence of unsafe methotrexate prescribing has reduced but it remains common, with substantial variation between organisations. We recommend the NHS invests in better strategies around implementation of safety recommendations. 21 deaths have been attributed to methotrexate poisoning but with no further details easily available: the full coroners reports for these deaths should be reviewed to identify recurring themes.","/content/10.1101/19000919v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19000919v1.full.pdf","2019-06-26","Health Systems and Quality Improvement

"Rate of Force Development is Related to Maximal Force, Muscle Quality and Physical Function in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease Predialysis","ABSTRACT 
Physical function is severely compromised in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and worsens with continued decreases in kidney function. Neuromuscular force capacity is a key determinant of physical function in healthy older adults, though its importance in persons with CKD is less understood. This study aimed to determine the relationships among rate of force development (RFD), muscle quality and physical function in a group of community-dwelling, middle-aged and older men (n=14; age=71.2+/-6.2 years) with CKD stages 3 and 4 (eGFR=37.5+/-10.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Force characteristics were determined from maximal knee extensor isometric contractions and muscle quality was estimated using ultrasound grayscale analysis. Physical function was assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and 5-repetition sit-to-stand (STS). eGFR was positively related to SPPB (r=0.54, p=0.044) and inversely related to STS (r=0.62, p=0.029). RFD was positively related to SPPB at time points 0-50 ms, 50-100 ms, and 0-300 ms (RFD0-50, r=0.73, p=0.010; RFD50-100, r=0.67, p=0.022 and RFD0-300 r=0.61, p=0.045); and inversely related to STS at time points 0-50 ms, 50-100 ms, and 0-300 ms (RFD0-50, r=-0.78, p=0.007; RFD50-100, r=-0.78, p=0.006 and RFD0-300 r=-0.76, p=0.009), respectively. RFD was positively associated with maximal voluntary force (MVF) at time points 50-100 ms, 100-200 ms, and 0-300 ms (RFD50-100, r=0.72, p=0.011; RFD100-200, r=0.66, p=0.025; and RFD0-300 r=0.70, p=0.016). Neither MVF nor muscle quality was significantly associated with functional measures. These findings highlight the relationships between RFD and physical function in middle-aged and older men with CKD stages 3 and 4.","/content/10.1101/19013557v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19013557v1.full.pdf","2019-12-11","Nephrology

"Mapping Psilocybin-Assisted Therapies: A Scoping Review","We conducted a scoping review on psilocybin-assisted therapy for addiction, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Psilocybin is a naturally-occurring tryptophan derivative found in species of mushroom with psycho-active properties. From 2022 records identified by database searching, 40 publications were included in the qualitative synthesis from which we identified 9 clinical trials with a total of 169 participants. Trials used a peak-psychedelic model of therapy, emphasizing inward journey through the use of eyeshades, set musical scores and with medium to high doses of psilocybin. No serious adverse effects were reported; mild adverse effects included transient anxiety, nausea and post-treatment headaches. Overall, the 9 trials all demonstrated safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in the treatments of obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder, treatment-resistant unipolar depression, anxiety or depression in patients with life-threatening cancer and demoralization among long-term AIDS survivors.The literature was found to be early and exploratory, with several limitations: only 5 were randomized controlled trials, small and homogenous patient sample size, difficulties in blinding, and the confounding influence of psychological supports provided. Further research is indicated to establish effectiveness for these and other indications, with a more diverse range of patients, and with differing program and dosing modalities.

"Evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV","Background:
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of 2019-nCoV in humans was reported in Wuhan, China. We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to provide evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission.
Methods:
A confirmed case of 2019-nCoV was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of 2019-nCoV in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of the confirmed cases were collected from their medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interviewing confirmed cases.
Results:
A total of 188 confirmed cases were identified from January 1 to 27, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 84 (44.6%) cases were from 31 cluster infections. Thirty cases (16.0%) were identified as secondary cases, in which 25 and 9 cases were identified in cluster infections and family cluster infections, respectively. 2019-nCoV were detected in three cases with mild respiratory symptoms, and in two asymptomatic cases. The whole viral genomes within the same family cluster infections were exactly the same, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with 2019-nCoVs identified in Wuhan on December 2019.
Conclusions:
We observed increasing human-to-human transmissions of 2019-nCoV in Guangdong, China, and most of them were identified in cluster infections. Our findings indicate that prevention strategies of containing the person-to-person transmission of 2019-nCoV in households, hospitals and communities are urgently needed.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019141v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019141v2.full.pdf","2020-02-06","Epidemiology

"Cognitive profile partly mediates allergy-associated decrease in mental health","There is a well-established link between allergies and mental health. While both atopic and food allergies are associated with increased levels of depression and anxiety, it is unclear what the mechanism behind this relationship is. Several theories touch upon potential psychological mechanisms, but until now only general reductions in cognitive performance as a function of allergy have been reported. We employed a tablet-based high-resolution assessment of cognition that also recorded mental health, socio-economic status, and allergies in 533 children aged 7-9 years. We then employed mediation analyses to investigate the role of cognitive variables in the relation between allergy and mental health, Welch's t-tests to test for differences between children with and without allergies, and logistic regression to identify what variables predicted allergic state. In line with previous research, we found children with allergies reported higher levels of anxiety and depression. Furthermore, they showed a unique profile of higher processing speed, equal verbal short-term memory, and worse performance on tests of fluid reasoning, number sense, search organisation, and spatial short-term memory. We confirmed that these variables predicted allergic state using logistic regression. Finally, mediation analyses showed that cognition partially mediated the relationship between allergy and both anxiety and depression. Our results suggest that allergies bias children towards particular cognitive profiles, which in turn are risk factors for anxiety and depression. This supports the view that early intervention could reduce the number of allergic children that develops comorbid psychiatric conditions.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20019778v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.20019778v2.full.pdf","2020-02-06","Pediatrics

"Cortical abnormalities and identification for first-episode schizophrenia via high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging","Background: Evidence from neuroimaging has implicated abnormal cerebral cortical patterns in schizophrenia. Application of machine learning techniques is required for identifying structural signature reflecting neurobiological substrates of schizophrenia at the individual level. We aimed to detect and develop a method for potential marker to identify schizophrenia via the features of cerebral cortex using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Method: In this study, cortical features were measured, including volumetric (cortical thickness, surface area, and gray matter volume) and geometric (mean curvature, metric distortion, and sulcal depth) features. Patients with first-episode schizophrenia (n = 52) and healthy controls (n = 66) were included from the Department of Psychiatry at Xijing Hospital. Multivariate computation was used to examine the abnormalities of cortical features in schizophrenia. Features were selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The diagnostic capacity of multi-dimensional neuroanatomical patterns-based classification was evaluated based on diagnostic tests.
Results: Mean curvature (left insula and left inferior frontal gyrus), cortical thickness (left fusiform gyrus), and metric distortion (left cuneus and right superior temporal gyrus) revealed both group differences and diagnostic capacity. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.88, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of were 94%, 82%, and 88%, respectively. Confirming these findings, similar results were observed in the independent validation. There was a positive association between index score derived from the multi-dimensional patterns and the severity of symptoms (r = 0.40, P < .01) for patients.
Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate a view of cortical differences with capacity to discriminate between patients with schizophrenia and healthy population. Structural neuroimaging-based measurements hold great promise of paving the road for their clinical utility in schizophrenia.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020768v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020768v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Baseline Structural and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predicts Early Treatment Response in Schizophrenia with Radiomics Strategy","Multimodal neuroimaging features might enable accurate classification and provide personalized treatment options in psychiatric domain. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate whether structural and functional features for predicting response to overall treatment of schizophrenia at the end of the first or a single hospitalization and in addition cross validate the results. This structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study included 85 and 63 patients with schizophrenia at baseline in dataset 1 and 2, respectively. After treatment, patients were classified as responders and non-responders. Features of gray matter and functional connectivity were extracted. Radiomics analysis was used to explore the predictive performance. Prediction models were based on structural features, functional features, and combined features. We found that the prediction accuracy was 80.38% (sensitivity: 87.28%; specificity 82.47%) for the model using functional features, and 69.68% (sensitivity: 83.96%; specificity: 72.41%) for the model using structural features. Our model combined both structural and functional features accurately predicted 92.04% responder and 80.23% non-responders to overall treatment, with an accuracy of 85.03%. These results highlight the power of structural and functional MRI-derived radiomics features to predict early response to treatment in schizophrenia. Prediction models of the very early treatment response in schizophrenia could augment effective therapeutic strategies.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020784v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020784v1.full.pdf","2020-02-07","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"The role of institutional trust in preventive and treatment-seeking behaviors during the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak among residents in Hubei, China","Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on  January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried.
Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. 
Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.

"Clinical features and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome in coronavirus disease 2019","Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19.
Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined.
Results: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS. 
Conclusions: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024166v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024166v2.full.pdf","2020-02-21","Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine

"Estimating the case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 epidemic in China","Background: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China since late December 2019. Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic.
Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 20 Feb 2020. Competing risk model were used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR estimation was calculated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. 
Results: As of 20 Feb 2020, totally 75,570 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The CFR of COVID-19 were 8.71% (95% CI: 7.95%-9.64%) in Hubei province, including Wuhan, the epicenter, and 1.21% (95% CI: 1.07%-1.40%) in other areas of China, respectively. We observed obvious decreasing trends of adjusted CFR for COVID-19, with three distinct turning points on January 30, February 6, and February 14 for Hubei province, and one turning point on February 7 for other areas, respectively.
Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China, over 7 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation and recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023630v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023630v2.full.pdf","2020-02-21","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Is glycaemia associated with poorer brain health and risk of dementia? Cross sectional and follow-up analysis of the UK Biobank","Objective: To understand the relationship across the glycaemic spectrum with incident dementia, brain structure, and cognitive decline.
Research Design and Methods: UK Biobank participants, aged 40-69 at recruitment. HbA1c and diabetes diagnosis define baseline glycaemic categories. Outcomes included incident vascular dementia (VD), Alzheimers dementia (AD), hippocampal volume (HV), white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, cognitive function and decline. All results are in reference to normoglycaemic individuals (HbA1c 35-<42 mmol/mol). 
Results: 210433 (47%), 15246 (3%), 3280 (0.7%), 20793 (5%) individuals had low HbA1c, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and known diabetes, respectively.  Pre- and known diabetes markedly increased incident VD, (hazard ratios (HR) 1.51, 95%CI=1.01;2.25 and 1.96, 95%CI=1.49;2.58, respectively), less so AD (1.18, 0.92;1.52 and 1.13 0.95,1.33), adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic variables. For VD, multivariate adjustment, driven by antihypertensives, attenuated associations, HR 1.27, 0.84;1.91 and 1.45,1.07;1.97. Pre- and known diabetes conferred elevated risks of cognitive decline (odds ratio OR 1.53, 1.02;2.29 and 1.49, 1.02;2.18, respectively). People with pre-diabetes, undiagnosed and known diabetes had higher WMH volumes (4%, 30%, 3%, respectively), and lower HV (34.51 mm3, 11.73 mm3 and 61.13 mm3 respectively). People with low-normal HbA1c (<35 mmol/mol) had 5% lower WMH volume and 13.6 mm3 greater HV than normoglycaemic individuals.  
Conclusions: Pre and known diabetes increase VD risks, less so AD.  Excess VD risks were largely accounted for by treated hypertension. Hyperglycaemic states were associated with adverse, whereas low normal HbA1c was associated with favourable brain structure compared to normoglycaemic individuals. Our findings have implications for cardiovascular medication in hyperglycaemia for brain health.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024471v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024471v2.full.pdf","2020-02-21","Epidemiology

"A prospective evaluation of inter-rater agreement of routine medical records audits at a large general hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil.","Background
The quality of the patient's medical records is strictly related to patient safety. Besides, its data are widely used in observational studies. However, the reliability of the information extracted from them is a matter of concern in audit processes to ensure inter-rater agreement (IRA). Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the IRA among members of the Patient's Health Record Review Board (PHRRB), in routine auditing of medical records, and the impact of periodic discussions of results with raters.
Methods
Prospective longitudinal study conducted between July of 2015 and April of 2016 at Hospital Municipal Dr. Moyses Deutsch, a large public hospital in Sao Paulo. The PHRRB was composed of 12 physicians, 9 nurses and 3 physiotherapists, who audited medical records, monthly, with the number of raters changing throughout the study. It was carried out PHRRB meetings to reach a consensus on criteria that the members have to rate in the auditing process. It was created a review chart that raters should verify the registry of patient's secondary diagnosis, chief complaint, history of presenting complaint, past medical history, medication history, physical exam and diagnostic testing. It was obtained the IRA every three months. The Gwet's AC1 coefficient and Proportion of Agreement (PA) were calculated to evaluate the IRA for each item over time.
Results
The study included 1884 items from 239 records with an overall full agreement among raters of 71.2%. A significant IRA increase by 16.5% (OR=1.17; 95% CI=1.03-1.32; p=0.014) was found in the routine PHRRB auditing, with no significant differences between the PA and the Gwet's AC1, that showed a similar evolution over time. The PA decreased by 27.1% when at least one of the raters was absent from the review meeting (OR=0.73; 95% CI=0.53-1.00; p=0.048).
Conclusions
Medical record quality has been associated with the quality of care and could be optimized and improved by targeted interventions. The PA and the Gwet's AC1 are suitable agreement coefficients that are feasible to be incorporated in the routine of PHRRB evaluation process.

"Subacute effects of the psychedelic ayahuasca on the salience and default mode networks","Background: Recent years have seen a growing interest in the therapeutic use of psychedelic substances for the treatment of anxiety and depression in patients with affective and mood disorders. Neuroimaging studies have just begun to explore how brain networks supporting perceptual and higher-order cognitive and emotional functions are affected during the acute effects of psychedelics. Even less is known on the neural correlates of the subacute effects taking place one to a few days after the psychedelic experience. This study explores the subacute changes of primary sensory brain networks and networks supporting higher-order affective and self-referential functions after a single session with the psychedelic ayahuasca.
Methods: We leveraged task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging data one day before and one day after a randomized placebo-controlled trial exploring the effects of ayahuasca in naive healthy participants (21 placebo/22 ayahuasca). We derived functional connectivity maps of the salience, default mode, visual and sensorimotor networks using a seed-to-whole brain connectivity approach, and statistically assessed post-session functional connectivity changes between the ayahuasca and placebo groups. Connectivity changes were subsequently associated with scores of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale assessed during the acute session.
Results: Our findings revealed increased functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex of the salience network and decreased functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex of the default mode network one day after the session in the ayahuasca group. No connectivity changes between groups were found in primary sensory networks. Subacute increased connectivity of the salience network correlated positively with altered somesthesia scores assessed during the acute effects of ayahuasca, while decreased connectivity of the default mode network correlated negatively with altered volition scores.
Conclusion: These findings provide preliminary evidence for subacute functional changes induced by the psychedelic ayahuasca on higher-order cognitive brain networks known to support interoceptive, affective, and self-referential processes.","/content/10.1101/19007542v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19007542v2.full.pdf","2020-02-21","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Effects of a Mediterranean Diet and physical activity on atherothrombosis biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk individuals","Objective. Following a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and being physically active decrease cardiovascular risk. However, their individual and combined effects on atherothrombosis biomarkers are unexplored. 
Approach and Results. In 358 random volunteers from the PREDIMED trial (Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea), we assessed the 1-year effects of an intervention with MedDiet, enriched with virgin olive oil (MedDiet-VOO; N=120) or nuts (MedDiet-Nuts; N=119) versus a low-fat control diet (N=119), on atherothrombosis markers. In a secondary, observational approach, we studied the associations of 1-year changes in MedDiet adherence, physical activity (PA) levels, and their combination, with 1-year differences in atherothrombosis biomarkers. The MedDiet-VOO intervention increased HDL platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase activity by 8.2% (95% CI: 0.92; 15.6) and decreased HDL-bound a1-antitrypsin levels by 5.8% (95% CI: -11.6; -0.046) versus control diet. The MedDiet-Nuts intervention reduced non-esterified fatty acid levels by 9.1% (95% CI: -18.0; -0.19) relative to control. Only the low-fat diet was associated with increases in platelet factor-4 and prothrombin factor 1+2 concentrations versus baseline (P=0.012 and P=0.003, respectively). Increments in MedDiet adherence (+1 point) were associated with lower fibrinogen levels (-1.8%, 95% CI: -3.38; -0.17). Increases in PA (+100 METs.min/d) were linked to lower prothrombin factor1+2 (-5.2%, 95% CI: -10.4; -0.077) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 concentrations (-3.0%, 95% CI: -5.93; -0.12). Finally, 1-point increments in MedDiet adherence plus 100 METs.min/d of PA were related to lower D-dimer levels (-1.52%, 95% CI: -3.10; 0.026; P-interaction=0.047).
Conclusions. Following a MedDiet and increasing PA were associated with improvements in atherothrombosis biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk individuals.","/content/10.1101/19001909v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19001909v3.full.pdf","2020-02-21","Nutrition

"Auditory tests for characterizing hearing deficits: The BEAR test battery","Introduction: The Better hEAring Rehabilitation (BEAR) project aims to provide a new clinical profiling tool, a test battery, for hearing loss characterization. Whereas the loss of sensitivity can be efficiently measured using pure-tone audiometry, the assessment of supra-threshold hearing deficits remains a challenge. In contrast to the classical 'attenuation-distortion' model, the proposed BEAR approach is based on the hypothesis that the hearing abilities of a given listener can be characterized along two dimensions reflecting independent types of perceptual deficits (distortions). A data-driven approach provided evidence for the existence of different auditory profiles with different degrees of distortions. Design: Eleven tests were included in a test battery, based on their clinical feasibility, time efficiency and related evidence from the literature. The tests were divided into six categories: audibility, speech perception, binaural processing abilities, loudness perception, spectro-temporal modulation sensitivity and spectro-temporal resolution. Study sample: Seventy-five listeners with symmetric, mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss were selected from a clinical population. Results: The analysis of the results showed interrelations among outcomes related to high-frequency processing and outcome measures related to low-frequency processing abilities. Conclusions: The results showed the ability of the tests to reveal differences among individuals and their potential use in clinical settings.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20021949v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20021949v2.full.pdf","2020-02-22","Otolaryngology

"Longitudinal characteristics of lymphocyte responses and cytokine profiles in the peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients","Background: The dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines profiles of patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their correlation with the disease severity remain unclear.

Method: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. 

Findings: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-<U+03B3> levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19.

Conclusion: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. N8R may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023671v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023671v2.full.pdf","2020-02-22","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Estimating the case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 epidemic in China","Background: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China since late December 2019. Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic.
Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 20 Feb 2020. Competing risk model was used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR was estimated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. 
Results: As of 20 Feb 2020, totally 75,570 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The CFR of COVID-19 were estimated to be 8.71% (95% CI: 7.95%-9.64%) in Hubei province, including Wuhan, the epicenter, and 1.21% (95% CI: 1.07%-1.40%) in other areas of China, respectively. We observed obvious decreasing trends of CFR for COVID-19, with three distinct turning points on January 30, February 6, and February 14 for Hubei province, and one turning point on February 7 for other areas, respectively.
Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China, over 7 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023630v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023630v3.full.pdf","2020-02-22","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Assessing the Tendency of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) Outbreak in China","Since December 8, 2019, the spread of COVID-19 is increasing every day. It is particularly important to predict the trend of the epidemic for the timely adjustment of the economy and industries. We proposed a Flow-SEHIR model in this paper, based on which we further analyzed the trends of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) in China.   
The results show that the basic reproductive numbers R0 of COVID-19 is 3.56 (95% CI: 2.31-4.81). The number of daily confirmed new cases reaches the inflection point on Feb. 6-10 outside Hubei. For the maximum of infected cases number, the predicted peak value in China except Hubei was estimated to be 13806 (95% CI: 11926-15845). The peak arrival time is on March 3-9. The temporal number of patients in most areas of China outside Hubei will peak from March 12 to March 15. The peak values of more than 73.5% provinces or regions in China will be controlled within 1000. According to Flow-SEHIR model and estimations from the data of evacuation of nationals from Wuhan, the peak cumulative number of patients in Hubei was estimated to be 403481 (95% CI: 143284-1166936).","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021444v4?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021444v4.full.pdf","2020-02-22","Epidemiology

"Clinical Characteristics of 24 Asymptomatic Infections with COVID-19 Screened among Close Contacts in Nanjing, China","Background
Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers.

Methods
Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. 
 
Findings
None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Interpretation
The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025619v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025619v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Profiling ACE2 expression in colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients by single-cell transcriptome analysis","A newly identified novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused numerous acute respiratory syndrome cases in Wuhan China from December 2019 to Feb 2020. Its fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS-nCoV, has been reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019-nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets. According to the expression profile of ACE2 in colon epithelial cells, we speculate adenoma and colorectal cancer patients are more likely to be infected with 2019-nCoV than healthy people. Our data may provide a theoretical basis for the classification and management of future 2019-nCoV susceptibility people in clinical application.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023457v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023457v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23","Gastroenterology

"SARS-CoV-2 infection does not significantly cause acute renal injury: an analysis of 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a single hospital, Wuhan, China","Summary

Background Whether the patients with COVID-19 infected by SARS-CoV-2 would commonly develop acute renal function damage is a problem worthy of clinical attention. This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients.

Methods 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography (CT) scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time RT-PCR.

Findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease. In addition, 5 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2, and diagnosed as COVID-19. Beside the treatment of COVID-19, CRRT was also applied three times weekly. The course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable, without exacerbation of CRF, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CRF were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without renal illness before, and one patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 ORF 1ab from 5 cases with CRF.

Interpretation Acute renal impairment was uncommon in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection does not significantly cause obvious acute renal injury, or aggravate CRF in the COVID-19 patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025288v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025288v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"The cross-sectional study of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients in Xiangyang, Hubei province","Summary 

Objective To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalized patients and to offer suggestions to the urgent needs of COVID-19 prevention, diagnosis and treatment. 

 

Methods We included 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1 peoples hospital, Hubei, China until Feb 9th, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed.  

 

Findings All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99). Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time RT-PCR results. 

 

Interpretation Most COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe cases and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.

"Early Prediction of Disease Progression in 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Patients Outside Wuhan with CT and Clinical Characteristics","Objective: To determine the predictive value of CT and clinical characteristics for short-term disease progression in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). 
Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. 
Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP were included, of which 15 (10.6%) patients developed severe NCP during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and 95% CI, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported patients but not in imported patients. However, no significant difference in lung involvement was found on CT between imported and nonimported patients (all P > 0.05). Patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to have more severe lung involvement. Spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between CT severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all P < 0.05).
Conclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025296v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025296v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Novel KITLG regulatory variants are associated with lung function in African American children with asthma","Baseline lung function, quantified as forced expiratory volume in the first second of exhalation (FEV1), is a standard diagnostic criterion used by clinicians to identify and classify lung diseases. Using whole genome sequencing data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute TOPMed project, we identified a novel genetic association with FEV1 on chromosome 12 in 867 African American children with asthma (p = 1.26 x 10-8,  = 0.302). Conditional analysis within 1 Mb of the tag signal (rs73429450) yielded one major and two other weaker independent signals within this peak. We explored statistical and functional evidence for all variants in linkage disequilibrium with the three independent signals and yielded 9 variants as the most likely candidates responsible for the association with FEV1. Hi-C data and eQTL analysis demonstrated that these variants physically interacted with KITLG and their minor alleles were associated with increased expression of KITLG gene in nasal epithelial cells. Gene-by-air-pollution interaction analysis found that the candidate variant rs58475486 interacted with past-year SO2 exposure (p = 0.003,  = 0.316). This study identified a novel protective genetic association with FEV1, possibly mediated through KITLG, in African American children with asthma.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20019588v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20019588v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Mak","/highwire/citation/72402/bibtext",7,"240220-7","24-02-2020","72402"
"On the treatment effect heterogeneity of antidepressants in major depression. A Bayesian meta-analysis","Background: The average treatment effect of antidepressants in major depression was found to be about 2 points on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, which lies below clinical relevance. Here, we searched for evidence of a relevant treatment effect heterogeneity that could justify the usage of antidepressants despite their low average treatment effect.
Methods: Bayesian meta-analysis of 169 randomized, controlled trials including 58,687 patients. We considered the effect sizes log variability ratio (lnVR) and log coefficient of variation ratio (lnCVR) to analyze the difference in variability of active and placebo response. We used Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses (REMA) for lnVR and lnCVR and fitted a random-effects meta-regression (REMR) model to estimate the treatment effect variability between antidepressants and placebo.  
Results: The variability ratio was found to be very close to 1 in the best fitting models (REMR: 95% HPD = [0.98, 1.02], lnVR REMA: 95% HPD = [1.00, 1.02]), whereas the CVR REMA showed a reduced variability 95% HPD [0.80,0.84]. The Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) showed that the lnVR REMR and the lnVR REMA outperform the lnCVR REMA. The between-study variance t2 under the REMA was found to be (95% HPD [0.00, 0.00]). 
Conclusions: The published data on antidepressants for the treatment of major depression is compatible with a near-constant treatment effect. Although it is impossible to rule out a substantial treatment effect heterogeneity, its existence seems rather unlikely. Since the average treatment effect of antidepressants falls short of clinical relevance, the current prescribing practice should be re-evaluated.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.19015677v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.19015677v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Volkmann","/highwire/citation/72403/bibtext",8,"240220-8","24-02-2020","72403"
"Integrative Analysis Reveals a Molecular Stratification of Systemic Autoimmune Diseases","Background: Clinical heterogeneity, a hallmark of systemic autoimmune diseases (SADs) impedes early diagnosis and effective treatment, issues that may be addressed if patients could be grouped into a molecular defined stratification.
Methods: With the aim of reclassifying SADs independently of the clinical diagnoses, unsupervised clustering of integrated whole blood transcriptome and methylome cross-sectional data of 918 patients with 7 SADs and 263 healthy controls was undertaken. In addition, an inception cohort was prospectively followed for 6 and 14 months to validate the results and analyze if cluster assignment changed or not with time.
Results: Four clusters were identified. Three clusters were aberrant, representing inflammatory, lymphoid, and interferon patterns each including all diagnoses and defined by genetic, clinical, serological and cellular features. A fourth cluster showed no specific molecular pattern and accumulated also healthy controls. An independent inception cohort showed that with time, the molecular clusters remain stable, showing that single aberrant molecular signatures characterize each individual patient.
Conclusions: Patients with SADs can be jointly stratified into three stable disease clusters with specific molecular patterns differentiating different molecular disease mechanisms. These results have important implications for future clinical trials and the study of therapy non-responsiveness marking a paradigm shift in the view of SADs.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20021618v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20021618v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Barturen","/highwire/citation/72406/bibtext",9,"240220-9","24-02-2020","72406"
"Variation in the Availability and Cost of Essential Medicines for Non-Communicable Diseases in Uganda: a descriptive time series analysis","Background: Availability of essential medicines for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is poor in low- and middle-income countries. Availability and cost are conventionally assessed using cross-sectional data. However, these characteristics may vary over time. 
Methods: We carried out a prospective, descriptive analysis of the availability and cost of essential medicines in 23 Ugandan health facilities over a five-week period. We surveyed facility pharmacies in-person up to five times, recording availability and cost of 19 essential medicines for NCDs and four essential medicines for communicable diseases. 
Results: Availability of medicines varied substantially over time, especially among public facilities. Among private-for-profit facilities, the cost of the same medicine varied from week to week. Private-not-for-profit facilities experienced less dramatic fluctuations in price. 
Conclusions: We conclude that there is a need for standardized, continuous monitoring to better characterize the availability and cost of essential medicines, understand demand for these medicines, and reduce uncertainty for patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026393v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026393v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Armstrong-Hough","/highwire/citation/72413/bibtext",10,"240220-10","24-02-2020","72413"
"Dose-response relationship between protein supplementation and muscle mass increase: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","Background: Muscle mass is essential for health promotion and maintenance; however, consensus regarding the effectiveness of protein interventions in increasing muscle mass is still lacking. 
Objective: To evaluate the dose-response relationship in the effects of protein on lean body mass (or fat-free mass).
Data Sources: PubMed and Ichushi-Web databases were searched. A manual search of the references of the literature included in this study and of that included in other meta-analyses was conducted. 
Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of supplementary protein intake on lean body mass were included.  
Data Extraction: Two researchers independently screened the abstracts and five, reviewed the full-texts.
Results: A total of 5411 subjects in 105 articles were included. Dose-response analysis using a multivariate-adjusted spline model showed that lean body mass significantly improved with about 5 g/day of supplementary protein intake; this effect further increased with > 50 g/day supplementary protein intake.
Conclusions: Increasing daily protein intake can help sustain and improve muscle mass in various populations, irrespective of sex, age, and exercise habits.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026252v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026252v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Tagawa","/highwire/citation/72414/bibtext",11,"240220-11","24-02-2020","72414"
"Loss-of-function myeloperoxidase mutations are associated with increased neutrophil counts and pustular skin disease","The identification of disease alleles underlying human autoinflammatory diseases can provide important insights into the mechanisms that maintain neutrophil homeostasis. Here, we focused on generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), a potentially life-threatening disorder presenting with cutaneous and systemic neutrophilia. Following the whole exome sequencing of 19 unrelated cases, we identified one affected individual harbouring a homozygous splice-site mutation (c.2031-2A>C) in MPO. The same homozygous change was subsequently identified in a further subject suffering from acral pustular psoriasis, a disease phenotypically related to GPP. MPO encodes myeloperoxidase, an essential component of neutrophil azurophil granules. Of interest, the c.2031-2A>C allele was previously described as a genetic determinant of myeloperoxidase deficiency (MPOD), a condition which can causes recurrent infections. Here, a systematic literature review identified four individuals suffering from MPOD and pustular skin disease, further strengthening the link between MPO and pustular inflammation. A subsequent analysis of the UK Biobank cohort demonstrated that the c.2031-2A>C allele was associated with increased neutrophil abundance in the general population (P=5.1x10-6). The same applied to three further MPOD mutations for which genotype data was available, with two alleles generating p-values <10-10. Finally, treatment of healthy neutrophils with an MPO inhibitor reduced cell apoptosis, highlighting a mechanism whereby MPO mutations affect granulocyte numbers. These findings identify MPO mutations as genetic determinants of pustular skin disease and neutrophil abundance. Given the recent interest in the development of MPO antagonists for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, our results also suggest that the pro-inflammatory effects of these agents should be closely monitored.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026161v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026161v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Vergnano","/highwire/citation/72417/bibtext",12,"240220-12","24-02-2020","72417"

"Comparison of throat swabs and sputum specimens for viral nucleic acid detection in 52 cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19)","Abstract
Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Diagnostic test based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) was the main means of confirmation, and sample collection was mostly throat swabs, which was easy to miss the diagnosis. It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher detection efficiency and accuracy.
Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay.
Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001).
Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026187v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026187v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Lin","/highwire/citation/72419/bibtext",14,"240220-14","24-02-2020","72419"

"CoVID-19 in Japan: What could happen in the future?","We adopt a novel statistical time delay dynamic model proposed in our recent work to estimate the
evolution of COVID-19. Based on the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cured cases published
daily by government, we effectively simulate and predict the outbreak trend of COVID-19 in different
regions in China. Meanwhile, the model reveals the growth rate of the epidemic, through which the basic
reproductive number is thus estimated to be 3.25 to 3.4. Then, we apply the model to track the spread
of COVID-19 in Japan. We find that the trend of the epidemic in Japan is strikingly similar to that in Wuhan, China at the early stage. Therefore there are reasons to draw a serious concern that there could be a rapid outbreak in Japan if no effective control measures are carried out immediately. Finally, we make a prediction of the future trend of COVID-19 in Japan, and suggest an enhancement of control measures as soon as possible, so as to avoid a severe outbreak","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026070v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026070v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Shao","/highwire/citation/72423/bibtext",16,"240220-16","24-02-2020","72423"
"Public Exposure to Live Animals, Behavioural Change, and Support in Containment Measures in response to COVID-19 Outbreak: a population-based cross sectional survey in China","Background
In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we aimed to investigate behavioural change on exposure to live animals before and during the outbreak, and public support and confidence for governmental containment measures.
Methods
A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities.
Findings 
Proportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p<0.001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p<0.001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P<0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures.
Interpretation 
The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan. With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026146v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026146v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Hou","/highwire/citation/72428/bibtext",17,"240220-17","24-02-2020","72428"
"From Isolation to Coordination: How Can Telemedicine Help Combat the COVID-19 Outbreak?","The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effectiveness of consultations and remote patient monitoring, multidisciplinary care, and prevention education and training.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025957v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025957v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Zhai","/highwire/citation/72431/bibtext",18,"240220-18","24-02-2020","72431"
"Evaluating the impact of international airline suspensions on COVID-19 direct importation risk","Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to predict COVID-19 times of arrival (ToA) for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we provide estimated ToA for all other countries. By combining effective distance with a measure for the country's vulnerability (Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI)), we propose a metric to rank vulnerable countries at immediate risk of case emergence. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025882v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025882v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Adiga","/highwire/citation/72432/bibtext",19,"240220-19","24-02-2020","72432"
"The efficacy of convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza","Background. Administration of convalescent plasma may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections. However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose convalescent plasma use in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza.
Methods. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. The primary outcome was case fatality rates by influenza.
Results. We identified 5 RCTs of severe influenza. The pooled analyses showed no evidence for a reduction in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.06; p = 0.87; I2 = 35%). We also found non significant reductions in days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. There seemed to have a biological benefit of increasing HAI titer levels and decreasing influenza B virus loads and cytokines after convalescent plasma treatment. No serious adverse events was reported between two groups. Studies were commonly of low risk of bias with high quality. 
Conclusions. Convalescent plasma appears safe but may not reduce mortality in severe influenza. This therapy should be studied within the context of a well designed clinical trial for treatment of SARS Cov 2 infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025593v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025593v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Xu","/highwire/citation/72435/bibtext",20,"240220-20","24-02-2020","72435"
"Clinical characteristics of 51 patients discharged from hospital with COVID-19 in Chongqing,China","Abstract
Background:Since December 2019, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2)-infected disease (Coronavirus Disease 2019,COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan , China,and rapidly spread throughout China,even throughout the world. We try to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in non-Wuhan area,and explore its effective treatment. 
Methods:Retrospective, single-center case series of the 51 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital in Chongqing, China, from January 20 to February 3, 2020;The discharge time was from January 29 to February 11, 2020. The main results and indicators of epidemiology, demography, clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, imaging data and treatment data of 51 patients with covid-19 were collected and analyzed. The changes of blood routine and biochemical indexes at discharge and admission were compared. Compare the clinical characteristics of severe patients (including severe and critical patients) and non- severe patients (general patients).
Results: Of 51 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) and 32 (62.7%) were men.43(84.3%)patients had been to Wuhan or Other Hubei areas outside Wuhan,and 4(7.7%) patients had a clear contact history of COVID-19 patients before the onset of the disease, and 4(7.7%) patients had no clear epidemiological history of COVID-19.Common symptoms included fever (43 [84.3%]), cough (38 [74.5%]) and fatigue (22 [43.1%]). Lymphopenia was observed in 26 patients (51.0%), and elevated C-reactive protein level in 32 patients (62.7%). Ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (41 [80.4%]),Local consolidation of pneumonia in some patients(17 [33.3%]).Most of the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine decoction (28 [54.9%]),all of them received aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon a-1b for injection and oral antiviral therapy with Lopinavir and Ritonavir tablets (51 [100%]); Most of the patients were given Bacillus licheniformis capsules regulated intestinal flora treatment (44 [86.3%]). 10 patients (19.6%) received short-term (3-5 days) glucocorticoid treatment. Compared with non-severe patients (n = 44), severe patients (n = 7) were older (median age, 52 years vs 44 years), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (4 [57.1%] vs 0 [0.0%]), most of them needed antibiotic treatment (7 [100%] vs 4 [9.1%], most of them needed nutritional diet (6 [85.7%) vs 0 [0.0%], and were more likely to have dyspnea (6 [85.7%] vs 5 [11.4%]),most of them needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation (6 [85.7%] vs 0 [0.0%]). Except one patient died, the remaining 50 patients were discharged according to the discharge standard, the common clinical symptoms disappeared basically, the lymphocyte increased significantly (P=0.008), CRP decreased significantly (P <0.001). The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR, 9-13).
Conclusion:In 51 single center cases confirmed as COVID-19 and discharged from the hospital, 13.7% of the patients were severe. The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough and asthenia,Some patients had obvious dyspnea. They had clinical laboratory and radiologic characteristics. There is no specific drug treatment for the disease. For the treatment of COVID-19, in addition to oxygen inhalation and antiviral treatment, attention should be paid to the dialectical treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, regulation of intestinal flora, nutritional support treatment and other comprehensive treatment.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025536v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025536v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"lei","/highwire/citation/72436/bibtext",21,"240220-21","24-02-2020","72436"
"Artificial intelligence assisted standard white light endoscopy accurately characters early colorectal cancer: a multicenter diagnostic study","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third in incidence and mortality of cancer. Screening with colonoscopy has been shown to reduce mortality by 40-60%. Challenge for screening indistinguishable precancerous and noninvasive lesion using conventional colonoscopy was still existing. We propose to establish a propagable artificial intelligence assisted high malignant potential early CRC characterization system (ECRC-CAD). 4,390 endoscopic images of early CRC were used to establish the model. The diagnostic accuracy of high malignant potential early CRC was 0.963 (95% CI, 0.941-0.978) in the internal validation set and 0.835 (95% CI, 0.805-0.862) in external datasets. It achieved better performance than the expert endoscopists. Spreading of ECRC-CAD to regions with different medical levels can assist in CRC screening and prevention.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20025650v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20025650v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Meng","/highwire/citation/72439/bibtext",22,"240220-22","24-02-2020","72439"
"Genomic risk scores for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and its subtypes","Aims: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune disease and a common cause of chronic disability in children. Diagnosis of JIA is based purely on clinical symptoms, leading to treatment delays. Despite JIA having substantial heritability, the construction of genomic risk scores (GRSs) to aid or expedite diagnosis has not been assessed. Here, we generate GRSs for JIA and its subtypes and evaluate their performance.

Methods: We examined three case/control cohorts (UK, US, and Australia) with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes. We trained GRSs for JIA and its subtypes using lasso-penalised linear models in cross-validation on the UK cohort, and externally tested in the Australian and US cohorts.

Results: The JIA GRS alone achieved cross-validated AUC=0.670 in the UK cohort and externally validated AUCs of 0.657 and 0.671 in US-based and Australian cohorts, respectively. In logistic regression of case/control status, the corresponding odds ratios per standard deviation (s.d.) of GRS were 1.831 [1.685-1.991] and 2.008 [1.731-2.345], and were unattenuated by adjustment for sex or the top 10 genetic principal components. Extending our
analysis to JIA subtypes revealed that enthesitis-related JIA had both the longest time-to-referral and the subtype GRS with the strongest predictive capacity overall across datasets: AUCs 0.80 in UK; 0.83 Australian; 0.69 US-based. The particularly common oligoarthritis JIA subtype also had a subtype GRS outperformed those for JIA overall, with AUCs of 0.71, 0.75 and 0.77, respectively.

Conclusions: A genomic risk score for JIA has potential to augment purely clinical JIA diagnosis protocols, prioritising higher-risk individuals for follow-up and treatment. Consistent with JIA heterogeneity, subtype-specific GRSs showed particularly high performance for enthesitis-related and oligoarthritis JIA.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025924v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025924v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Canovas","/highwire/citation/72440/bibtext",23,"240220-23","24-02-2020","72440"
"Development and Evaluation of A CRISPR-based Diagnostic For 2019-novel Coronavirus","Background: The recent outbreak of infections by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the third zoonotic CoV has raised great public health concern. The demand for rapid and accurate diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges. Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics. Methods: 2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for this novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed and compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR). Results: 2019-nCoVs sequenced in our study were conserved with the Wuhan strain, and shared certain genetic similarity with SARS-CoV. A high degree of variation in the level of viral RNA was observed in clinical specimens. CRISPR-nCoV demonstrated a near single-copy sensitivity and great clinical sensitivity with a shorter turn-around time than RT-PCR. Conclusion: CRISPR-nCoV presents as a promising diagnostic option for the emerging pathogen.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025460v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025460v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Hou","/highwire/citation/72442/bibtext",24,"240220-24","24-02-2020","72442"
"Evidence of unexplained discrepancies between planned and conducted statistical analyses: a review of randomized trials","Background: Choosing or altering the planned statistical analysis approach after examination of trial data (often referred to as p-hacking) can bias results of randomized trials. However, the extent of this issue in practice is currently unclear. We conducted a review of published randomized trials to evaluate how often a pre-specified analysis approach is publicly available, and how often the planned analysis is changed.

Methods: A review of randomised trials published between January and April 2018 in six leading general medical journals. For each trial we established whether a pre-specified analysis approach was publicly available in a protocol or statistical analysis plan, and compared this to the trial publication. 

Results: Overall, 89 of 101 eligible trials (88%) had a publicly available pre-specified analysis approach. Only 22/89 trials (25%) had no unexplained discrepancies between the pre-specified and conducted analysis. Fifty-four trials (61%) had one or more unexplained discrepancies, and in 13 trials (15%) it was impossible to ascertain whether any unexplained discrepancies occurred due to incomplete reporting of the statistical methods. Unexplained discrepancies were most common for the analysis model (n=31, 35%) and analysis population (n=28, 31%), followed by the use of covariates (n=23, 26%) and the approach for handling missing data (n=16, 18%). Many protocols or statistical analysis plans were dated after the trial had begun, so earlier discrepancies may have been missed.

Conclusions: Unexplained discrepancies in the statistical methods of randomized trials are common. Increased transparency is required for proper evaluation of results.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025684v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025684v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Cro","/highwire/citation/72446/bibtext",25,"240220-25","24-02-2020","72446"

"Estimating the risk of 2019 Novel Coronavirus death during the course of the outbreak in China, 2020","Since the first case of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China, the number of cases continues to grow across China and  multiple cases have been exported to other countries. The cumulative number of reported deaths is at 637 as of February 7, 2020. Here we statistically estimated the time-delay adjusted death risk for Wuhan as well as for China excluding Wuhan to interpret the current severity of the epidemic in China. We found that the latest estimates of the death risk in Wuhan could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas we estimate it ~1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas. Because the elevated death risk estimates are likely associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system, enhanced public health interventions including social distancing and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to bring the epidemic under control.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025163v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025163v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Mizumoto","/highwire/citation/72452/bibtext",27,"240220-27","24-02-2020","72452"

"Estimating population level disease prevalence using genetic risk scores","Clinical classification is essential for estimating disease prevalence in a population but is difficult, often requiring complex investigations. The widespread availability of population level genetic data makes novel genetic stratification techniques a highly attractive alternative. We propose a generalizable mathematical framework for determining the prevalence of a disease within a population using genetic risk scores. We compare and evaluate methods based on the means of the genetic risk scores distributions, the Earth Movers Distance between distributions, a linear combination of kernel density estimates of distributions, and an Excess method. We assess the impact on estimates resulting from the population size and proportion of cases to non-cases. Using less discriminative genetic risk scores still results in robust estimates of proportion. Genetic stratification techniques provide exciting research tools enabling unbiased insights into disease prevalence and clinical characteristics unhampered by clinical classification criteria.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025528v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025528v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Thomas","/highwire/citation/72461/bibtext",29,"240220-29","24-02-2020","72461"
"Can Envelope Following Responses Be Used to Estimate Level Compression in the Auditory System?","The ability to compress the large level range of incoming sounds into a smaller range of vibration amplitudes on the basilar membrane (BM) is an important property of the healthy auditory system. Sensorineural hearing impairment typically leads to a decrease in sensitivity to sound and a reduction of the amount of compression observed in BM input-output functions. While sensitivity loss can be measured efficiently via audiometry, no measure has yet been provided that represents fast and reliable compression estimates in the individual listener. In the present study, magnitude-level functions obtained from envelope following responses (EFR) to four simultaneously presented amplitude modulated tones were measured in normal-hearing (NH) and sensorineural hearing-impaired (HI) listeners. The slope of part of the EFR magnitude-level function was used to estimate level compression. The median values of the compression estimates in the group of NH listeners were found to be consistent with previously reported group-averaged compression estimates based on psychoacoustical measures and group-averaged distortion-product otoacoustic emission magnitude-level functions in human listeners, and similar to BM compression values measured invasively in non-human mammals. The EFR magnitude-level functions for the HI listeners were less compressive than those for the NH listeners, consistent with a reduction of BM compression in HI listeners. A computer model of the auditory nerve (AN) was used to simulate EFR magnitude-level functions at the level of the AN. The recorded EFRs at the chosen amplitude modulation rates (81-98 Hz) were considered to represent neural activity originating from the auditory brainstem and midbrain rather than a direct measure of AN activity. Nonetheless, the AN model simulations could account for the main trends observed in the recorded data. The model simulations suggested that the growth of the EFR magnitude-level function is highly influenced by contributions from off-frequency neural populations, which compromises the possibility to estimate local (i.e., frequency specific) compression with EFRs. Furthermore, the model showed that while the slope of the EFR magnitude-level function is sensitive to the loss of compression observed in HI listeners due to outer hair cell dysfunction, it is also sensitive to inner hair cell dysfunction. Overall, it is concluded that EFR magnitude-level functions do not represent frequency specific level compression in the auditory system.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20024919v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20024919v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Encina-Llamas","/highwire/citation/72462/bibtext",30,"240220-30","24-02-2020","72462"
"Generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 epidemic in China: a web-based cross-sectional survey","Background: China has been severely affected by COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) since December, 2019. This study aimed to assess the population mental health burden during the epidemic, and to explore the potential influence factors.
Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 603 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem.
Results: Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 34.0%, 18.1%, and 18.1%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than older people (P=0.024). Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep quality (P=0.045). Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and times to focus on the COVID-19 (= 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were associated with poor sleep quality.
Conclusions: Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during COVID-19 epidemic in China. Young people, people who spent too much time on the epidemic, and healthcare workers were at high risk for mental illness. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025395v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025395v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Huang","/highwire/citation/72463/bibtext",31,"240220-31","24-02-2020","72463"
"A Note on NCP Diagnosis Number Prediction Model","In December 2019, pneumonia infected with the novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan, China. We aimed to use a mathematical model to predict number of diagnosed patients in future to ease anxiety on the emergent situation. In this retrospective, all diagnosis number from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020 reported from China was included and downloaded from WHO website. We develop a simple but accurate formula to predict the next day diagnosis number:N_i/N_(i-1) =<U+3016>(N_(i-1)/N_(i-2) )<U+3017>^a,where Ni is the total diagnosed patient till the ith day, and a was estimated as 0.904 at Feb 10. Based on this model, it is predicted that the rate of disease infection will decrease exponentially. The total number of infected people is limited; thus, the disease will have limited impact.

"Whole genome sequencing of ovarian granulosa cell tumors reveals tumor heterogeneity and a high-grade TP53-specific subgroup.","Adult granulosa cell tumors (AGCTs) harbor a somatic FOXL2 c.402C>G mutation in 95% of cases and are mainly surgically removed due to limited systemic treatment effect. In this study, potentially targetable genomic alterations in AGCTs were investigated by whole genome sequencing on 46 tumor samples and matched normal DNA. Copy number variant (CNV) analysis confirmed gain of chromosome 12 and 14, and loss of 22. Pathogenic TP53 mutations were identified in three patients with highest tumor mutational burden and mitotic activity, defining a high-grade AGCT subgroup. Within-patient tumor comparisons showed 29-80% unique somatic mutations per sample, suggesting tumor heterogeneity. A higher mutational burden was found in recurrent tumors, as compared to primary AGCTs. FOXL2-wildtype AGCTs harbored DICER1, TERT(C228T) and TP53 mutations and similar CNV profiles as FOXL2-mutant tumors. Our study confirms that absence of the FOXL2 c.402C>G mutation does not exclude AGCT diagnosis. The lack of overlapping variants in targetable cancer genes indicates the need for personalized treatment for AGCT patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20025007v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20025007v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Roze","/highwire/citation/72466/bibtext",33,"240220-33","24-02-2020","72466"
"ACP risk grade: a simple mortality index for patients with confirmed or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) during the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan, China","Background: Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, healthcare systems capacities in highly endemic areas have been overwhelmed. Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients.
Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports.
Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age = 60 years and CRP = 34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age = 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L; age < 60 years and CRP = 34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age < 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L, 0%) (P <0.001), respectively. 
Conclusion: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025510v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025510v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Lu","/highwire/citation/72471/bibtext",34,"240220-34","24-02-2020","72471"
"COVID-19 in Wuhan: Immediate Psychological Impact on 5062 Health Workers","BACKGROUND: 
The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented psychological stress on health workers (HWs). We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.
METHODS: 
We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety.
RESULTS: 
We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (hazard ratio[HR], 1.31; P=0.032), years of working> 10 years (HR, 2.02; P<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (HR, 1.51; P<0.001), history of mental disorders (HR, 3.27; P<0.001), and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (HR, 1.23; P=0.030) were risk factors for stress, whereas care provided by hospital and department administrators(odds ratio [OR], 0.76; P=0.024) and full coverage of all departments with protective measures (OR, 0.69; P=0.004) were protective factors.
CONCLUSIONS: 
Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological protective measures implemented by the hospital could be helpful.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025338v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025338v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Zhu","/highwire/citation/72476/bibtext",35,"240220-35","24-02-2020","72476"
"Association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12 (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly involved.

"Risks Associated with Animal-Assisted Intervention Programs: A Literature Review","The benefits of animal-assisted interventions (AAI), to utilize companion animals as an adjunctive treatment modality, is well-established and a burgeoning research field. However, few studies have evaluated the potential hazards of these programs, such as the potential for therapy animals to transfer hospital-associated pathogens between individuals and the hospital environment. Here we review the current literature on the possible risks of hospital-based AAI programs, including zoonotic pathogen transmission. We identified twenty-nine articles encompassing reviews of infection control guidelines and epidemiological studies on zoonotic pathogen prevalence in AAI. We observed substantial heterogeneity in infection control practices among hospital AAI programs. Few data confirmed pathogen transmission between therapy animals and patients. Given AAI's known benefits, we recommend that future research utilize a One Health framework to evaluate microbial dynamics among therapy animals, patients, and hospital environments. This framework may best promote safe practices to ensure the sustainability of these valuable AAI programs.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025130v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025130v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Dalton","/highwire/citation/72480/bibtext",37,"240220-37","24-02-2020","72480"

"Research on the relationship between postoperative D-dimer Clearance and Trauma infection complications in patients with different degrees of fracture","Background: Occurrence of thrombotic disease after orthopedic surgery has always been an important issue affecting the prognosis of patients. In this paper, retrospective analysis was used to analyze the D-dimer clearance rate after different degrees of fractures, suggesting that the D-dimer clearance rate can be used as an index to evaluate thrombotic diseases after orthopedic surgery.
Material and Methods: Seventy-five patients with orthopedic surgery were randomly selected from March to June 2017. According to the degrees of fractures and complications, they were divided into SF(single fracture),MF(multiple fracture),FCI(Fracture combined with infection) three groups, 25 in each group. D-dimer results of each case on 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, and 7 days after orthopedic surgery were recorded and counted. The slope of correlation equation of D-dimer value according to time is the D-dimer clearance rate.
Results: The D-dimer clearance rate in the SF;MF;FCI group was -0.0490,-0.0502 and -0.0692;The P value is respectively 0.0049,0.0061 and 0.0163,the difference is significant.
Conclusions: After traumatic fracture surgery, whether D-dimer clears at a normal rate is closely related to its outcome. Decreasing D-dimer clearance is related to postoperative infections and thrombotic diseases. D-dimer clearance can be used as an important parameter and observation index for judging the clinical outcome of patients with complications such as severe trauma and infection. At the same time, we can further study the cut-off value of D-dimer clearance.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20024737v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20024737v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"MA","/highwire/citation/72482/bibtext",39,"240220-39","24-02-2020","72482"
"Application of the Adaptive Validation Design to estimate the association between transmasculine/transfeminine status and self-inflicted injury among transgender and gender-nonconforming children and adolescents.","Background: An internal validation substudy compares an imperfect measurement of a variable with a gold standard measurement in a subset of the study population. Validation data permit calculation of a bias-adjusted estimate, expected to equal the association that would have been observed had the gold standard measurement been available for the entire study population. Guidance on optimal sampling of participants to include in validation substudies has not considered monitoring validation data as they accrue. In this paper, we develop and apply the framework of Bayesian monitoring to determine when sufficient validation data have been collected to yield a bias-adjusted estimate of association with a prespecified level of precision. 

Methods: We demonstrate the utility of this method using the Study of Transition, Outcomes and Gender, a cohort study of transgender and gender non-conforming children and adolescents. Transmasculine and transfeminine status were determined from the gender code in the electronic medical record at cohort enrollment. This status is known to be misclassified because it can indicate either gender identity or sex recorded at birth. Our interest is in the association between transmasculine and transfeminine status and self-inflicted injury. To address possible exposure misclassification, we demonstrate the ability of the method to determine when sufficient validation data have been collected to calculate a bias-adjusted estimate of association that is less than 80% greater than the precision of the conventional estimate. 

Results: In the conventional age-adjusted analysis, we observed that transmasculine children and adolescents were 1.80-fold more likely to inflict self-harm than transfeminine youths (95%CI 1.27, 2.55). Using the adaptive validation approach, 200 cohort members were required for validation to yield a bias-adjusted estimate of OR=3.03 (95%CI 1.76, 5.56), which was similar to the bias-adjusted estimate using complete validation data (OR=2.63, 95%CI 1.67, 4.23).

Conclusions: Our method provides a novel approach to effective and efficient estimation of classification parameters as validation data accrue. This method can be applied within the context of any parent epidemiologic study design, and modified to meet alternative criteria given specific study or validation study objectives.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20024182v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20024182v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Collin","/highwire/citation/72483/bibtext",40,"240220-40","24-02-2020","72483"
"Effectiveness of intervention strategies for Coronavirus Disease 2019 and an estimation of its peak time","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly to other provinces and neighboring countries. Two mathematical SEIR models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in China. The basic reproductive number R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and 6.22 to 1.67 in entire China from 19 January to 16 February 2020. Wuhan is estimated to have reached a peak in the number of confirmed cases on 6 February 2020. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day, new symptomatic infections and COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan occurred on February 6, February 3 and February 14. The number of confirmed cases would decrease to less than 10 on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the other parts of China. Five cities with top risk index in China (except for Wuhan) are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city. We should take more strict isolation measures to end the epidemic ahead of time.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025387v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025387v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"pan","/highwire/citation/72484/bibtext",41,"240220-41","24-02-2020","72484"
"Guangzhou Diabetic Eye Study: rationale, design, methodology and baseline data","Purpose: The incidence and risk factors for diabetic retinopathy (DR) in southern China remains unclear. This project aims to explore the onset and progression of DR and their determinants through a prospective cohort in South China.
Methods: The Guangzhou Diabetic Eye Study (GDES) recruited patients with type 2 diabetic patients registered in the community health centres in Guangzhou, China. Patients with history of ocular treatment, severe refractive opacity, or other systemic diseases were excluded. Comprehensive examinations were performed including visual acuity, refraction, ocular biometry, fundus imaging, blood and urine tests. The biological samples were collected for further study. 
Results: A total of 2305 eligible patients were included in the final analysis. In total, 14.58% of the participants had any DR and 4.25% had vision-threatening DR (VTDR), among which 76 (3.30%), 197 (8.55%), 45 (1.95%) and 17 (0.74%) were classified as mild NPDR, moderate NPDR, severe NPDR and PDR, respectively. There were 93 (4.03%) patients of diabetic macular edema (DME). The presence of any DR was independently associated with a longer duration of DM, higher degree of HbA1C, insulin treatment, higher average arterial pressure, higher concentration of serum creatinine, presence of urinary microalbumin, older age, and lower BMI (all P <0.001). For VTDR, 7 factors were significant: older age, a longer duration of DM, higher concentration of HbA1c, use of insulin, lower BMI, higher concentration of serum creatinine, and high albuminuria (all P<0.05). These factors were also independently associated with DME (all P <0.001).
Conclusions: The GDES is the first large-scale prospective cohort study of the diabetic population in southern urban China, which will help to identify newer imaging and genetic biomarkers for DR in this population.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024778v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024778v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Wang","/highwire/citation/72486/bibtext",42,"240220-42","24-02-2020","72486"
"Correlation between renal function and peripapillary choroidal thickness in treatment nave diabetic eyes using SS-OCT","Purpose: To investigate the association between the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and peripapillary choroidal thickness (pCT) and retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) thickness in diabetic patients by using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).
Methods: Ocular treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus registered in the community health system in Guangzhou, China were recruited to participate in this prospective cross-sectional study. The eGFR was determined using the Xiangya formula, and the renal function was categorized into non-chronic kidney disease (non-CKD), mild CKD, and moderate to severe CKD (MS-CKD) according to the guidelines. The pCT and pRNFL thicknesses at 12 o'clock were obtained using a SS-OCT by a circular scan with a diameter of 3.4 mm centring on the optic nerve head, and the data from only one eye in each patient were used. 
Results: This study included 1,408 diabetic patients, with a mean age of 64.47.8 years. The average pCT decreased with renal function deterioration, with 126.0 m  58.0 m for non-CKD, 112.0 m  51.2 m for mild CKD and 71.0m  22.9 m for MS-CKD, respectively (P<0.001). The pCT was found to be significantly thinner in CKD patients in all quadrantes (P < 0.05 in all regions) with the exception of the inferior quadrant, and the average pCT was positively correlated with eGFR ( = 0.3, 95%CI = 0.0 to 0.6, p = 0.021) after making adjustments for other factors. The pRNFL thickness in the nasal quadrant was significantly reduced in patients with CKD, and pRNFL thickness was positively correlated with eGFR ( = 0.1, 95%CI = 0.0-0.2, p = 0.009) after adjusting for other factors.
Conclusion: Impaired renal function was associated with a reduction of pCT and pRNFL thickness in patients with type 2 diabetes. The measurement of pCT and pRNFL may provide additional information for predicting renal impairment.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024760v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024760v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Liu","/highwire/citation/72492/bibtext",43,"240220-43","24-02-2020","72492"
"PERFORMANCE OF GOOGLE TRENDS FOR EARLY DETECTION OF DENGUE INFECTION EPIDEMICS IN JAKARTA AND YOGYAKARTA","Background: Early detection of disease outbreak is among the most critical role of the sub-national authorities as mandated by the health decentralization policy. Given the continuous growth of Internet penetration and dependencies of the society on the digital ecosystem, it is essential to investigate the potential innovations to improve the existing surveillance system using digital epidemiology. Several studies, including in Indonesia, have assessed the roles of Google Trends (GT) to improve dengue surveillance systems. However, they were mostly located in specific areas or national level only. No reports are available to compare the performance of GT for early detection of dengue outbreak among high burdened provinces.    
Aims: This study aimed to examine the correlation between GT data on dengue-related query terms with the official dengue surveillance reports in Jakarta and Yogyakarta Province.
Methods: Relative Search Volume of GT data for dengue were collected from the area of Jakarta and Yogyakarta between 2012 to 2016. Those data were compared with the official dengue reports from the Indonesian Ministry of Health using Pearson correlation and Time-lag correlation, performed with Stata version 13.
Results: GT data are positively correlated with the routine surveillance report in Jakarta (r = 0.723, p-value= 0.000) and Yogyakarta Province (r = 0.715, p-value= 0.000). In Jakarta, search term of DBD demonstrated a very strong correlation for lag-1 (r =0.828, p-value= 0.000). This finding indicates that GT data could possibly detect the dengue outbreak a month earlier, especially in Jakarta. Hence, GT data can be used to monitor disease dynamics and improve the public awareness of a potential outbreak in near-real-time. 
Conclusion: GT data were positively correlated with the routine surveillance report in Jakarta and Yogyakarta Province. Early warning system utilizing GT data is potentially more accurate in Jakarta than in Yogyakarta. We assume that it is related with the larger population as well as the Internet use activities that drives the higher volume of Google search on dengue in Jakarta compared to Yogyakarta. Further studies involving other digital data sources, for example, Twitter, online news, and administrative data from the national health insurance are essential to strengthen the current surveillance system with the new digital epidemiology approach.

"Clinical characteristics of 50404 patients with 2019-nCoV infection","Objective: To provide reliable evidence of evidence-based medicine for the treatment and prevention of the 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV.
Methods: PubMed,Cochrane Library,Embase and other databases were searched. Some studies on the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection were collected for Meta-analysis
.Results: 9 studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total of 50404 patients with 2019-nCoV infection.According to Meta-analysis, among the clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV infection, the incidence of fever is 90.9% , the incidence of cough is 70.8%, and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue is 41%. The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal chest CT was 95.6%, the proportion of severe cases in all infected cases was 21.3%, and the mortality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was 4.8%.
Conclusion: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and most of them have abnormal chest CT examination.Some people have muscle soreness or fatigue, ARDS.

"Determining Personalized Community Health Needs by Feature Selection and Clustering","The Center for Disease Control, through the Community Health Data Initiative (CHDI), has released a large dataset by county detailing the overall health indicators, demographics, and major risk factors and causes of morbidity and mortality in the US. In order to address the heterogeneity of community healthcare in the US, k-Means clustering was performed on the CHDI dataset to determine community subtypes in terms of health challenges and outcomes. The optimal number of eight clusters was determined by the Elbow Method, and clusters were analyzed to determine significant differences in demographic. In order to determine community-specific healthcare solutions and directions, feature selection and modeling of healthcare outcomes was performed for each of the eight subtypes using LASSO regression. It was determined that different features significantly impact health outcomes in the different clusters, providing information about the unique health challenges faced by these different types of communities. LASSO regression using the entire unclustered dataset yielded significantly poorer results on the sub-clusters in terms of model performance, further supporting the claim that modeling community-specific needs is a vital step for delivering accurate and adequate community healthcare. These results have the potential to inform policymaking at the local/municipal level, as well as inform the approaches taken by primary practitioners to address community needs.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20024612v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20024612v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Agar-Johnson","/highwire/citation/72505/bibtext",46,"240220-46","24-02-2020","72505"
"BEYOND BONES - THE RELEVANCE OF VARIANTS OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE (HYPERMOBILITY) TO FIBROMYALGIA, ME/CFS AND CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING DIAGNOSTIC CLASSIFICATION: AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY","Objectives: To understand the relevance of symptomatic hypermobility and related connective tissue variants to the expression of symptoms in Fibromyalgia and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS).  The study further tested if specific subfactors within the diagnostic classification of hypermobility predict clinical presentations.
Design: We report part of a larger case-control study exploring mechanisms of chronic pain and fatigue in Fibromyalgia and ME/CFS (https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN78820481)
Setting: an NHS Clinical Research Facility.
Participants: A subsample of 87 participants were assessed for symptomatic hypermobility by a trained clinician; 63 presented with a clinical diagnosis of either Fibromyalgia and or ME/CFS confirmed at screening; 24 participants were confirmed as healthy controls.
Main outcome measures:  1) Brighton Criteria for joint hypermobility syndrome and 2017 hEDS diagnostic criteria. 2) ACR 2010 Diagnostic Criteria for Fibromylagia and Canadian and Fukada diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS.  3) Self report measures of subjective pain, fatigue and interoceptive sensibility.
Results: Twenty of the 63 patients (32%) presented with a clinical diagnosis of Fibromyalgia; 24 (38%) with a clinical diagnosis of ME/CFS and 19 (30%) with dual diagnoses of fibromyalgia and ME/CFS. After evaluation using clinical research tools, 56 patients (89%) met ACR diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia; 59 (94%) Canadian Criteria for ME/CFS; and 61 (97%) Fukada Criteria for ME/CFS. After research evaluation 52 patients (85%) in fact met diagnostic criteria for Fibromyalgia and ME/CFS on all three sets of tools (ACR, Canadian, Fukada). In addition, 51 patients (81%) and 9 (37.5%) healthy controls met Brighton Criteria for joint hypermobility syndrome and 11 (18%) and 2 (8%) of patients and controls respectively, on the 2017 hEDS criteria. Of these patient participants with symptomatic hypermobility only 12 (23.5%) had received a prior diagnosis of hypermobility. 

Across all participants meeting Brighton Criteria, 13 (22%) also endorsed a hEDS diagnosis.  Membership of the patient group was predicted by meeting the Brighton Criteria for joint hypermobility syndrome (p=<0.001, OR 7.08, 95% CI 2.50 to 20.00), but not by meeting the hEDS criteria. The historical, rather than current Beighton score correlated with; 1) total pain reported on the McGill Pain Questionnaire (short form), (r= 0.25, n= 73, p=0.03); 2) Widespread Pain Index (derived from ACR diagnostic criteria) (r=0.26, n= 86, p=0.01); 3) ACR symptom severity (r=0.27, n=85, p=0.01); 4) Fatigue Impact (r=0.29, n=56, p=0.28); and 5) interoceptive sensibility (r=0.30, n=56, p=0.02.
Conclusions: Symptomatic joint hypermobility is relevant to symptoms and diagnosis in Fibromyalgia and ME/CFS.  These conditions are poorly understood yet have a considerable impact on quality of life. Further work is needed to determine the prevalence of hEDS within the general population and define the critical clinical dimensions within symptomatic hypermobility. It is important to note the high rates of mis/underdiagnosis of symptomatic hypermobility in this group. Moreover, we need to clarify the role of variant connective tissue in dysautonomic and inflammatory mechanisms implicated in the expression of pain and fatigue in fibromyalgia and ME/CFS. Our observations have implications for diagnosis and treatment targets.

"Atypical depression shares genetic predisposition with immuno-metabolic traits: a population-based study","Background: Depression is a highly prevalent and heterogenous disorder. Clinical heterogeneity may reflect different underlying biological mechanisms. This study aims to determine whether atypical depression shows higher heritability and different degree of overlap with polygenic risk for cardio- and immuno- metabolic traits than non-atypical depression.  

Methods: Data included 30,069 individuals from the UK Biobank who met criteria for lifetime major depression. Participants reporting both hypersomnia and weight gain were classified as atypical cases (N = 1,854), and the others as non-atypical cases (N = 28,215). Non-atypical cases were further classified as typical depression (i.e. insomnia and weight loss; N = 10,142). Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for 21 traits were generated using genome-wide summary statistics (Bonferroni corrected p=2.2x10-4). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of atypical and typical depression was estimated. 

Results: Atypical depression had a higher polygenic risk for BMI (OR=1.20, [1.15-1.26], p=2.37e-14), and C-reactive protein (OR=1.11, [1.06-1.17], p=8.86e-14) vs. non-atypical cases. Leptin PRS was very close to the significance threshold (p=4.13e-04), but the effect disappeared when considering GWAS summary statistics of leptin adjusted for BMI. PRS for daily alcohol use was inversely associated with atypical depression (OR=0.88, [0.84-0.93], p=1.04e-05) vs. non-atypical depression. SNP-based heritability on the liability scale was not significantly different between atypical and typical depression (5.2% and 4.5%, respectively). 

Conclusions: Atypical depression shows evidence of distinct genetic predisposition to immune-metabolic traits in line with the previous literature. These genetic signals suggest that biological targets including cardiometabolic or immune pathways may be germane to therapies in individuals with atypical depression.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024091v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024091v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Badini","/highwire/citation/72507/bibtext",48,"240220-48","24-02-2020","72507"
"Influence of physical activity and sleep duration on the retinal and choroidal structure in diabetic patients: An SS-OCT study","Purpose: To assess the association between physical activity, sleep duration, sitting time, and alterations of posterior segment structures with swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).
Methods: Patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) were recruited, and diabetic patients without retinopathy (non-DR) who matched for age and duration of diabetes were used as control. The physical activity, siting time, and sleep duration were obtained by using standardized questionnaire. OCT parameters included: retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness, ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thickness, retinal thickness, and choroidal thickness (CT). Linear regression was conducted to analyse the association.
Results: Each group included 116 diabetic patients. Average macular CT was positively correlated with metabolic equivalents (MET) only in the DR group, independent of age, gender, and other potential confounding factors ( = 1.163, P = 0.006). Average macular CT was also positively correlated with sleep duration only in the non-DR group, independent of age, gender, and other potential confounding factors ( = 10.54, P = 0.031). No correlation was found between MET, sleep duration, and other OCT parameters. Sitting time was not significantly correlated with OCT parameters either.
Conclusions: Physical activity and sleep duration are both positively correlated with macular choroidal thickness; this suggests that more time in physical activity and sleep benefit the retina, while there was no association between sedentary time and OCT parameters. Further studies are warranted to clarify the underlying mechanisms and the role of physical activity and sleep in CT alterations and DR.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024752v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024752v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Liu","/highwire/citation/72508/bibtext",49,"240220-49","24-02-2020","72508"
"Novel Coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) epidemic scale estimation: topological network-based infection dynamic model","Backgrounds: An ongoing outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Covid-19) hit Wuhan and hundreds of cities, 29 territories in global. We present a method for scale estimation in dynamic while most of the researchers used static parameters. 
Methods: We used historical data and SEIR model for important parameters assumption. And according to the timeline, we used dynamic parameters for infection topology network building. Also, the migration data was used for the Non-Wuhan area estimation which can be cross-validation for the Wuhan model. All data were from the public. 
Results: The estimated number of infections was 61,596 (95%CI: 58,344.02-64,847.98) by 25 Jan in Wuhan. And the estimation number of the imported cases from Wuhan of Guangzhou was 170 (95%CI: 161.27-179.26), infection scale in Guangzhou was 315 (95%CI: 109.20-520.79), while the imported cases were 168 and the scale of the infection was 339 published by the authority.

"Macular vessel density in diabetes and diabetic retinopathy with swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography","Purpose: Previous studies on the association between macular vessel density (VD) and diabetic retinopathy had conflicting conclusions. This study assessed the alterations of macular VD, as well as other factors, in diabetic patients using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) in a large-scale sample from Chinese communities.
Methods: Patients with type 2 diabetes without history of ocular treatment were recruited from 2017 to 2018. The average and quadrant parafoveal vessel density (PVD) were obtained with a commercial SS-OCTA device (Triton, Topcan, Japan). Univariate and multivariate linear regression was used to analyse the correlation of PVD with diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema (DME), HbA1c, and other factors.
Results: A total of 919 patients were included in the final statistical analysis. After adjusting for other confounding factors, the DR patients had significantly lower average PVD ( = -1.062, 95% CI = -1.424 to -0.699, P < 0.001) in comparison with those without DR. In addition, the patients with mild DR or vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) also had significantly lower PVD (P < 0.001 for mild DR, and P = 0.008 for VTDR) compared with those without DR. Age and HbA1c were also significantly related to PVD measurements, as shown by multivariable linear regression. Participants with DME had a significantly lower average PVD and temporal PVD than those without DME (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: Reduced PVD was independently associated with more severe DR, older age, higher HbA1c level, and the presence of DME. These findings provide manifest evidence to suggest that macular vessel alterations play a role in the pathogenesis of DR.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20024174v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20024174v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Xie","/highwire/citation/72510/bibtext",51,"240220-51","24-02-2020","72510"
"Trends and prediction in daily incidence of novel coronavirus infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City: an application of Farr law","Background: The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has infected tens of thousands of patients in China. Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. 
Methods: We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. 
Results: We observed 50,995 (37001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city. However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend. The predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models.
Conclusions: This study shows the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City has reached the peak and was decreasing. However, there is a possibility of upward trend.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025148v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025148v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Xu","/highwire/citation/72511/bibtext",52,"240220-52","24-02-2020","72511"
"Phase adjusted estimation of the number of 2019 novel coronavirus cases in Wuhan, China","An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV / SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6 or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6 and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public heath intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024281v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024281v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Wang","/highwire/citation/72512/bibtext",53,"240220-53","24-02-2020","72512"
"Artificial neural networks in neurorehabilitation: A scoping review","BACKGROUND: Advances in medical technology produce highly complex datasets in neurorehabilitation clinics and research laboratories. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been utilized to analyze big and complex datasets in various fields, but the use of ANNs in neurorehabilitation is limited. OBJECTIVE: To explore the current use of ANNs in neurorehabilitation. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science were used for literature search. Studies in the scoping review (1) utilized ANNs, (2) examined populations with neurological conditions, and (3) focused rehabilitation outcomes. The initial search identified 1,136 articles. A total of 19 articles were included. RESULTS: ANNs were used for prediction of functional outcomes and mortality (n = 11) and classification of motor symptoms and cognitive status (n = 8). Most ANN-based models outperformed regression or other machine learning models (n = 11) and showed accurate performance (n = 6; no comparison with other models) in predicting clinical outcomes and accurately classifying different neurological impairments. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review provides encouraging evidence to use ANNs for clinical decision-making of complex datasets in neurorehabilitation. However, more research is needed to establish the clinical utility of ANNs in diagnosing, monitoring, and rehabilitation of individuals with neurological conditions.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025858v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025858v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Moon","/highwire/citation/72513/bibtext",54,"240220-54","24-02-2020","72513"
"Medication Improves Age Disparities in Six-Month Treatment Retention for Opioid Use Disorder","Background and Aims: Adolescents with opioid use disorder (OUD) are an understudied and vulnerable population. We examined the association between age and six-month treatment retention, and whether any such association was moderated by medication treatment.  
Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we used an insurance database with OUD treatment claims from 2006-2016. We examined 261,356 OUD treatment episodes in three age groups: adolescents (ages 12-17), young adults (18-25) and older adults (26-64).  We used logistic regression to estimate prevalence of six-month retention before and after stratification by treatment type (buprenorphine, naltrexone, or psychosocial services only). Insurance differences (commercial vs Medicaid) in medication treatment prevalence were also assessed. 
Results: Adolescents were far less likely to be retained compared to adults (17.6%; 95% CI 16.5-18.7% for adolescents; 25.1%; 95% CI 24.7-25.4% for young adults; 33.3%; 95% CI 33.0-33.5% for older adults). This disparity was markedly reduced after adjusting for treatment type.  For all ages, buprenorphine was more strongly associated with retention than naltrexone or psychosocial services. Adolescents who received buprenorphine were more than four times as likely to be retained in treatment (44.5%, 95% CI 40.6-49.0) compared to those who received psychosocial services (9.7%, 95% CI 8.8-10.8). Persons with commercial insurance were more likely to receive medication than those with Medicaid (73.3% vs 36.4%, (<U+03C7>2=57,870.6, p<.001).
Conclusions:  Age disparities in six-month treatment retention are strongly related to age disparities in medication treatment. Results point to need for improved implementation of medication treatment for persons with OUD, regardless of age or insurance status.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20023143v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20023143v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Mintz","/highwire/citation/72514/bibtext",55,"240220-55","24-02-2020","72514"
"A descriptive study of the impact of diseases control and prevention on the epidemics dynamics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Shanghai, lessons learned for metropolis epidemics prevention","Objective: To describe and evaluate the impact of diseases control and prevention on epidemics dynamics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Shanghai.

Design: A retrospective descriptive study

Setting: China

Participants: Epidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled for clinical features analysis.

Main outcome measure: Prevention and control measures taken by Shanghai government,  epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. Weibull distribution, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analysis. 

Results: COVID-19 transmission rate within Shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. Epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where >50% of cases were local. The incubation period was 6.4 (95% CI 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.9). Median time for COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (IQR: 4.8-11.0 days). By February 11th, proportion of patients being mild, moderate, severe and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265), 89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265), respectively; 47 people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 patient died.

Conclusion: Strict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. Controlling local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. Most COVID-19 severe cases progressed within 14 days of disease onset. Multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities had been observed before significant respiratory dysfunction.

"Postprandial changes in gastrointestinal function and transit in cystic fibrosis assessed by magnetic resonance imaging","Background and Aims
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multi-system genetic disorder affecting >72,000 people worldwide. Most people with CF experience gastrointestinal symptoms and some will develop complications such as distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. However the mechanisms of symptoms and complications are not understood. We evaluated gut function and transit of CF using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our hypotheses were: oro-caecal transit time (OCTT) is longer in CF, with lower small bowel water content (SBWC).  

Methods
Twelve people with CF at a tertiary centre and 12 age and sex-matched controls underwent serial MRIs over 1 day, with meals at set time points. The primary endpoint was OCTT, assessed by the appearance of a food bolus in the caecum. Other measures included SBWC, colonic volume, gastric half-emptying time and gastrointestinal symptoms. 

Results
OCTT was longer in CF (controls 210 minutes [173, 315] vs. CF 330 minutes [270, >360], p=0.04). There was no difference in gastric half-emptying times (controls 80 minutes [66, 88] vs. CF (97 [71, 128], p=0.3). Corrected SBWC was higher in CF (controls 34 L.min/m2 [28, 41] vs. CF 63 L.min/m2 [36, 80], p=0.021), with minimal second post-prandial decrease suggesting impaired ileal emptying. Corrected colonic volumes were higher in CF (controls (123 L.min/m2 [89, 146] vs. 186 L.min/m2 [166, 209], p=0.012). There were no differences in gastrointestinal symptoms.

Conclusions 
Significant differences in gut function and transit exist between CF and controls. Our methodology provides a platform for studying gastrointestinal function in CF and has identified new potential mechanisms of dysfunction.

"The clinical outcomes and effectiveness of mHealth interventions for diabetes and hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: With the development of technology, mobile health (mHealth) intervention has been proposed as a treatment strategy for chronic diseases that could improve the quality of chronic care and outcomes in some developed countries. However, the effectiveness of mHealth intervention in developing countries is not clear.
Purpose: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to study the clinical outcomes and effectiveness of mHealth interventions for diabetes and hypertension in countries with different levels of economic development. 
Methods: Pubmed, ResearchGate, Embase and Cochrane documents were searched by computer, and the retrieval period was from 2008 to June 2019. All studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mHealth treatments to other traditional treatments. Meta-analysis was conducted using stata software. 
Results: 51 RCTs (N=13,054 participants) were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Compared with the usual care, the mHealth interventions yielded significant mean differences in clinical outcomes, and had a positive effect on countries at different levels of economic development. It is reassuring that we found mHealth interventions combined with human intelligence could significantly improve clinical outcomes more than mHealth interventions alone [WMD (95%Cl)=-6.75 (-9.98, -3.52)] VS [WMD (95%Cl)=-2.53 (-4.99, -0.07)]. The main secondary outcomes showed that mHealth interventions could also improve quality of life, satisfaction and self-efficacy, etc.
Conclusion: This review shown that mHealth interventions as a therapeutic strategy could improve the management of diabetes and hypertension in countries with different levels of economic development.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025635v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025635v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"yaqian","/highwire/citation/72517/bibtext",58,"240220-58","24-02-2020","72517"
"Emotional and behavioural pathways to adolescent substance use and antisocial behaviour: results from the UK Millennium Cohort Study","This study examines the emotional and behavioural pathways to adolescent substance use and antisocial behaviour. Using a sample of 17,223 participants from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, we applied parallel-process growth mixture modelling on emotional and behavioural symptoms in those aged 3 to 14 and employed latent class analysis to identify patterns of substance use and antisocial behaviours at age 14. We then performed a multinomial regression analysis to explore the association between emotional and behavioural trajectories and patterns of adolescent substance use and antisocial behaviours, controlling for sociodemographic, family and maternal factors. We found five trajectories of emotional and behavioural symptoms and four classes of adolescence substance use and antisocial behaviour. Children and adolescents in the high externalising and internalising and moderate externalising trajectories were more likely to belong to any problematic behaviour class, especially the poly-substance use and antisocial behaviours class. Inclusion in the moderate externalising and internalising (childhood limited) class was associated with higher odds of belonging to the alcohol and tobacco class. These associations remained significant after controlling for important sociodemographic and contextual factors, such as maternal substance use, poverty, and parental status. Interventions on adolescent health promotion and risk behaviour prevention need to address the clustering of substance use and antisocial behaviour as well as the significant influence of early and chronic internalising and externalising symptoms on the aetiology of these behaviours.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20024158v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20024158v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Picoito","/highwire/citation/72518/bibtext",59,"240220-59","24-02-2020","72518"
"Mapping of yaws endemicity in Ghana; Lessons to strengthen the planning and implementation of yaws eradication.","Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subsp pertenue is a disease of poverty and affects communities where basic socio-economic amenities are lacking. With results showing that single dose azithromycin is effective in the treatment of yaws, the World Health Organisation introduced the Morges strategy with the intent to eradicate yaws by 2020. Ghana is one of the countries with the most yaws cases globally, and the National Yaws Eradication Program in Ghana intends to conduct Mass Drug Administration (MDA) of endemic communities in line with the Total Community Treatment plan of the Morges strategy. It is therefore important to map out endemic communities to ensure that MDA is both effective and financially efficient. Children with suspected yaws lesions were actively selected from the recruitment sites (schools and communities). A full medical history, study site information including GPS coordinates, demographic data including communities of residence and clinical assessment were taken. Each of the clinically diagnosed children were screened using the DPP Syphilis Screen & Confirm Assay (DPP). Samples for PCR were collected by swabbing ulcerative lesions of participants and tested for Treponema pallidum subsp pertenue and Haemophilus ducreyi DNA. In all, 625 children with a median age of 10 years were recruited into the study. While 401(64.2%) were DPP positive, only 141 of them had Treponema pallidum subsp pertenue DNA (TPE_DNA) accounting for 22.6% of those who were clinically diagnosed. Based on the DPP results, yaws was endemic in all the 4 study sites with participants from 88 communities in 13 districts in 4 regions in Ghana. There was no statistically significant difference between the various districts in terms of DPP results (x2=0.9364, p= 0.817) and 154 (24.6%) of those clinically diagnosed as yaws were positive for Haemophilus ducreyi DNA. Our study shows that communities endemic for yaws are also endemic for Haemophilus ducreyi i. Most yaws endemic communities were found at the border of other districts and regions. It is recommended that MDA should not only target endemic communities, but it should also target entire endemic districts as well as neighbouring districts in order to be effective.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025122v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025122v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Basing","/highwire/citation/72519/bibtext",60,"240220-60","24-02-2020","72519"
"Evolving epidemiology of novel coronavirus diseases 2019 and possible interruption of local transmission outside Hubei Province in China: a descriptive and modeling study","Background
The COVID-19 epidemic originated in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in December 2019 and has spread throughout China. Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. 
Methods
We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. 
Results  
The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January. 
Conclusion  
Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026328v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026328v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Zhang","/highwire/citation/72520/bibtext",61,"240220-61","24-02-2020","72520"
"Comparative study of the lymphocyte change between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases suggesting uncontrolled inflammation might not be the main reason of tissue injury","Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan in December 2019 and has since rapidly spread across China and to the globe. This virus shows unusually high transmission rate and unique clinical characteristics, with key pathological mechanism remaining unclear. Here, we analysed the laboratory data based on clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, in parallel comparison with non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases, in an attempt to elucidate the key pathological features of COVID-19 during its infection of the human body. 
Methods: We analysed biochemical indices and lymphocyte subpopulation distribution in the samples of COVID-19 infected patients, and compare the data with those from the pneumonia cases not caused by COVID-19. The study enrolled 125 patients, comprising 103 COVID-19-infected patients and 22 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Laboratory findings were extracted from electronic medical records. Blood was collected for lymphocyte subsets and cytokines determination by flow cytometry analysis. The differences in biochemical indices and lymphocyte subsets distribution between COVID-19-infected and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were analyzed. Correlation analysis was performed between leukocyte subgroups count and biochemical indexes relating to organ injury in COVID-19 infected patients (exclude asymptomatic infected cases). 
Results: We observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (CRP, LDH, AST, eGFR and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the COVID-19-infected and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the COVID-19 infected patients.
Conclusions: The present study indicates significantly different clinical features between COVID-19-caused and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia, especially in terms of lymphocytopenia and organ injury. Notably, correlation analysis demonstrates that tissue damage in COVID-19 patients is attributed to virus infection itself rather than uncontrolled inflammatory responses (""cytokine storm""). These findings provide new insights for developing efficient therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20024885v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20024885v1.full.pdf","2020-02-23",NA,"Zheng","/highwire/citation/72521/bibtext",62,"240220-62","24-02-2020","72521"
"Rapid colorimetric detection of COVID-19 coronavirus using a reverse tran-scriptional loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) diagnostic plat-form: iLACO","The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) threatens global health, given serious cause for concern. SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus  broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025874v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025874v1.full.pdf","2020-02-24","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Rapid Detection of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) by Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification","Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025155v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025155v1.full.pdf","2020-02-24","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Post-Exertional Malaise in People with Chronic Cancer-Related Fatigue","Context: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a distressing and persistent sense of tiredness or exhaustion that interferes with usual functioning. Chronic CRF continues for months after curative cancer treatment is complete. Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is a worsening of symptoms after physical or mental activity, with limited investigations in people with chronic CRF. 
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify and describe self-reported incidences of PEM in people with chronic CRF.
Methods: Participants (n=18) were eligible if they scored =34 on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale and had a cancer-related onset of fatigue. Participants completed a brief questionnaire to assess PEM over a 6-month time-frame (the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire - Post-Exertional Malaise; DSQ-PEM). In addition, a maximal exercise test was used to investigate self-reported symptom exacerbation (via an open-ended questionnaire) after strenuous physical exertion. 
Results: On the DSQ-PEM, three participants met previously defined scoring criteria, which included experiencing moderate to very severe symptoms at least half of the time, worsening of fatigue after minimal effort, plus a recovery duration of >24 h. Content analysis of responses to open-ended questionnaires identified five people who experienced a delayed recovery and symptoms of PEM after maximal exercise.
Conclusion: A subset of people with chronic CRF (up to 33% in this sample) may experience PEM. Exercise specialists and health care professionals working with people with chronic CRF must be aware that PEM may be an issue. Symptom exacerbation after exercise should be monitored, and exercise should be tailored and adapted to limit the potential for harm.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014829v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014829v2.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Oncology

"On the treatment effect heterogeneity of antidepressants in major depression. A Bayesian meta-analysis","Background: The average treatment effect of antidepressants in major depression was found to be about 2 points on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, which lies below clinical relevance. Here, we searched for evidence of a relevant treatment effect heterogeneity that could justify the usage of antidepressants despite their low average treatment effect.
Methods: Bayesian meta-analysis of 169 randomized, controlled trials including 58,687 patients. We considered the effect sizes log variability ratio (lnVR) and log coefficient of variation ratio (lnCVR) to analyze the difference in variability of active and placebo response. We used Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses (REMA) for lnVR and lnCVR and fitted a random-effects meta-regression (REMR) model to estimate the treatment effect variability between antidepressants and placebo. 
Results: The variability ratio was found to be very close to 1 in the best fitting models (REMR: 95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD) for VR [0.98, 1.02], lnVR REMA: 95% HPD for VR [1.00, 1.02]), whereas the lnCVR REMA showed a reduced variability (95% HPD for CVR [0.80,0.84]). The Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) showed that the REMR and the lnVR REMA outperform the lnCVR REMA. The between-study variance t2 under the REMA was found to be low (95% HPD for t2 [0.00, 0.00]). 
Conclusions: The published data from RCTs on antidepressants for the treatment of major depression is compatible with a near-constant treatment effect. Although it is impossible to rule out a substantial treatment effect heterogeneity, its existence seems rather unlikely. Since the average treatment effect of antidepressants falls short of clinical relevance, the current prescribing practice should be re-evaluated.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.19015677v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.19015677v2.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Estimating population level disease prevalence using genetic risk scores","Clinical classification is essential for estimating disease prevalence in a population but is difficult, often requiring complex investigations. The widespread availability of population level genetic data makes novel genetic stratification techniques a highly attractive alternative. We propose a generalizable mathematical framework for determining the prevalence of a disease within a population using genetic risk scores. We compare and evaluate methods based on the means of the genetic risk scores distributions, the Earth Movers Distance between distributions, a linear combination of kernel density estimates of distributions, and an Excess method. We assess the impact on estimates resulting from the population size and proportion of cases to non-cases. Using less discriminative genetic risk scores still results in robust estimates of proportion. Genetic stratification techniques provide exciting research tools enabling unbiased insights into disease prevalence and clinical characteristics unhampered by clinical classification criteria.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025528v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025528v2.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation for refractory scar-related ventricular tachycardia","Background:
Stereotactic radiosurgery is a form of radiotherapy that is performed in a single session and focuses high-dose ionizing radiation beams from a collimated radiation source to a small, localized area of the body. Recently, stereotactic radiosurgery has been applied to arrhythmias (stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation - STAR), with promising results reported in patients with refractory, scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT), a cohort with known high morbidity and mortality.
Objective:
Herein, we describe our experience with the use of CyberKnife, a frameless image-guided linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery system, in conjunction with CardioPlan, a cardiac specific radiotherapy planning software, to treat patients with scar-related VT, detailing its early and mid- to long-term results.
Methods:
This is a pilot, prospective study of patients undergoing STAR for refractory VT. The anatomical target for radioablation was defined based on the clinical VT morphology, electroanatomical mapping, and study-specific pre-procedural imaging with cardiac computed tomography. The target volume delineated with the aid of CardioPlan was treated with a prescription radiation dose of 25 Gy delivered in a single fraction by CyberKnife in an outpatient setting. Ventricular arrhythmias and radiation-related adverse events were monitored at follow-up to determine STAR efficacy and safety.
Result:
Five patients (100 % male, 63  12 years old, 80 % ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction 34  15 %) with refractory VT underwent STAR between January and June 2018. Radioablation was delivered in 82  11 minutes without acute complications. During a mean follow-up of 12  2 months, all patients experienced clinically significant mid- to late-term ventricular arrhythmia recurrence; two patients died of complications associated with their advanced heart failure. There were no clinical or imaging evidence of radiation necrosis or other radiation-induced complications in the organs at risk surrounding the scar targeted by radioablation.
Conclusion:
Despite good initial results, STAR did not result in effective ventricular arrhythmia control in the long term in a selected, high-risk population of patients with scar-related VT. The safety profile was confirmed to be favorable, with no radiation-related complications observed during follow-up. Further studies are needed to explain these disappointing results.","/content/10.1101/19012880v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19012880v2.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Cardiovascular Medicine

"A Novel Method for the Estimation of a Dynamic Effective Reproduction Number (Dynamic-R) in the CoViD-19 Outbreak","The CoViD-19 outbreak has escalated to a pandemic in the last few weeks, with no signs of stopping. Pharmaceutical solutions based upon virologic studies, at this point, remain inconclusive. In contrast, this paper looks towards epidemiological models during this phase of viral growth, in particular, by providing a responsive, timely model of the R value based on the previous few days' results.
Such an R value, although bearing less statistical precision due to limited sampling, could allow R to become a more effective, responsive standalone measure of infectious transmission. It demonstrates that the R value can be used as a dynamic,  time-dependent indicator without the use of curve-fitting, and also estimates the most recent R-value of the CoViD-19 outbreak to be about 4.29, based on  the data from the previous 3 days.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20023267v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20023267v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Epidemiology

"Lessons learnt from 288 COVID-19 international cases: importations over time, effect of interventions, underdetection of imported cases","288 cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection.  We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since the first importation, however 6 cases out of 10 were estimated to go undetected. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027326v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027326v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"The transition from primary colorectal cancer to isolated peritoneal malignancy is associated with a hypermutant, hypermethylated state","Colorectal Peritoneal metastases (CPM) develop in 15% of colorectal cancers. Cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS & HIPEC) is the current standard of care in selected patients with limited resectable CPM. Despite selection using known prognostic factors survival is varied and morbidity and mortality are relatively high. There is a need to improve patient selection and a paucity of research concerning the biology of isolated CPM. We aimed to determine the biology associated with transition from primary CRC to CPM and poor prognosis CPM, to identify those suitable for treatment with CRS & HIPEC and to identify targets for existing repurposed or novel treatment strategies. A cohort of patients with CPM treated with CRS & HIPEC was recruited and divided according to prognosis. Molecular profiling of the transcriptome, epigenome and genome of CPM and matched primary CRC was performed. 

CPM were characterised by frequent Wnt/  catenin negative regulator mutations, mismatch repair mutations and resulting high tumour mutational burden and dysregulation of methylation suggested by frequent TET2 mutations and mutations suggesting an immune evasive phenotype. Several novel therapies could be targeted to these frequent mutations including porcupine inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors and methylation inhibitors. Here we show the molecular features associated with CPM development and with poor prognosis. Potential applications include improving patient selection for treatment and in the development of novel and personalised treatments.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027318v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027318v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Oncology

"Estimation of COVID-2019 burden and potential for international dissemination of infection from Iran","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and continues to spread globally, with exported cases confirmed in 28 countries at the time of writing. During the interval between February 19 and 23, 2020, Iran reported its first 43 cases with eight deaths.  Three exported cases originating in Iran were identified, suggesting a underlying burden of disease in that country than is indicated by reported cases.  A large epidemic in Iran could further fuel global dissemination of COVID-19.  We sought to estimate COVID-19 outbreak size in Iran based on known exported case counts and air travel links between Iran and other countries, and to anticipate where infections originating in Iran may spread to next.  We assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries using using International Air Transport Association (IATA) data.  We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic that would result in cases being observed  in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada.  Time at risk estimates were based on a presumed 6 week epidemic age, and length of stay data for visitors to Iran derived from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).  We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran, and destination country rankings on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak . Scores range between 0-1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. UAE, Lebanon, and Canada ranked 3rd, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from Iran in February 2019. We estimated that 18,300 (95% confidence interval: 3770 to 53,470) COVID-19 cases would have had to occur in Iran, assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the country, in order to observe these three internationally exported cases reported at the time of writing.  Results were robust under varying assumptions about undiagnosed case numbers in Syria, Azerbaijan and Iraq.  Even if it were assumed that all cases were identified in all countries with certainty, the ""best case"" outbreak size was substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases), and far higher than reported case counts.  Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027375v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027375v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Epidemiology

"Estimation of risk factors for COVID-19 mortality - preliminary results","Since late December 2019 a new epidemic outbreak has emerged from Whuhan, China. Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender.  Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics.
We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest (OR=12.8328 CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic respiratory disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]). Males are more likely to die from COVID-19 (OR=1.8518 (CI95%[1.5996; 2.1270]). Some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results. A final point of paramount importance is that the equation presented here can be used to determine the probability of dying from COVID-19 for a particular patient, given its age interval, gender and comorbidities associated.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027268v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027268v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Epidemiology

"A novel germline EGFR variant p.R831H causes predisposition to familial CDK12-mutant prostate cancer with tandem duplicator phenotype","5-10% of total prostate cancer (PCa) cases are hereditary. Particularly, immunocheckpoint inhibitor-sensitive tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) accounts for 6.9% PCa cases, whereas genetic susceptibility genes remain completely unknown. We identified a Chinese family with two PCa patients, in which the PCa phenotype co-segregated with a rare germline variant EGFRR831H. Patient-derived conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRC) exhibited increased EGFR and AKT phosphorylation, and a sensitivity to EGFR antagonist Afatinib in migration assays, suggesting the EGFR allele was constitutively active. Both EGFRR831H-mutant tumors contained biallelic CDK12 inactivation, together with prominent tandem duplication across the genome. These somatic mutations could be detected in urine before surgery. Analysis of public databases showed a significant correlation between mutation status of EGFR and CDK12. Taken together, our genetic and functional analyses identified a previously undescribed link between EGFR and prostate cancer.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20027045v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20027045v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Oncology

"Non-existent ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers in abstracts indexed by PubMed","Prospective registration plays an important role in ensuring the transparency and reliability of clinical trials. Preregistration of clinical trials has been required by the ICMJE since 2005 and mandated by law for most clinical trial types since 2007. It is one of the roles of peer reviewers of a clinical trial publication to confirm that there is concordance between the registry entry and the submitted publication. On October 22, 2019, abstracts for all articles indexed by PubMed with publication type ""Clinical Trial"" and a publication date after January 1, 2003 were downloaded. Clinical trial registry identifiers were automatically extracted and tested for the existence of a corresponding entry on ClinicalTrials.gov. Among 38,001 published clinical trial registry numbers, 215 (0.6%) do not correspond to a legitimate clinical trial registry entry. While there is a small proportion of non-existent NCT numbers in our sample, even a single non-existent NCT number in a publication represents a failure on the part of journals who publish clinical trials to systematically ensure that reviewers always check clinical trial registry entries for concordance with the text submitted for publication.

rapidly spread in China, reached multiple continents currently.We aimed to reveal the
infectious characteristics of COVID-19 that provide more information for the research
of novel coronavirus.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study on the clinical characteristics of 128
COVID-19 cases with laboratory-confirmed from Xiangyang No 1 Hospitalad during
January 2020 to 16 February 2020.
Results: Female patients account for 53.1%. The aged below 20 years that
accounts for 1.6% of overall patients. The aged in 21~50, 51~65, over 66 years were
accounts for 44.5%, 35.1%,18.8%, respectively. In the difference age spectrum, all
severe groups compared with non-severe groups were difference significantly ( P <

rate of patients with sore throats (14.1%) was rare. The rate of chest computed
tomography scan showing ground glass opacity in overall, non-severe, severe groups
were 63.3%, 60.7%, 76.2%, respectively. White blood cell counts in the normal range
of overall patients, but severe group patients were increased significantly ( P < 0.01).
Lymphocytes of overall patients were decreased. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and

"Effect of exercise and dietary intervention on serum metabolomics in men with insomnia symptoms: a 6-month randomized-controlled trial","Background: Accumulating evidences have shown that lifestyle interventions such as exercise and diet are associated with improved sleep quality. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Assessing exercise and diet intervention associated changes in circulating metabolomics profile in people with insomnia symptoms may help to identify molecular biomarkers that may link lifestyle changes to improved sleep outcomes. 
Methods: The present study is a part of a 6-month randomized lifestyle intervention on sleep disorder subjects. Seventy-two Finnish men (aged: 51.6  10.1 years; body mass index, BMI: 29.3  3.9 kg/m2) with chronic insomnia symptoms who were assigned into different intervention groups completed this study (exercise n = 24, diet n = 27 and control n = 21). The exercise group was assigned to a progressive aerobic exercise training with intensity of 60 - 75% of estimated maximum heart rate, 3 - 5 times a week. The diet group aimed to reduce their total energy intakes by 300 to 500 kcal per day for the first three months. The control group were advised to maintain their current lifestyle. Sleep was assessed by using a non-contact sleep monitoring devise (Beddit sleep tracker). Blood samples were collected in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. after overnight fasting. Gas Chromatography Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) method was used to determine the serum metabolites.
Results: Twenty-one metabolites were significantly changed in the exercise group, thirty-three metabolites in the diet group and five metabolites in the control group after intervention, respectively. The differential metabolites after exercise intervention were mainly related to glycerolipids and carbohydrates metabolism, while dietary intervention altered mainly amino acids metabolism and fatty acids metabolism related metabolites. We subsequently assessed the change of those metabolites with the change of sleep parameters and found that decreased alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (r = -0.52, p = 0.026) was correlated with improved sleep efficiency (SE) in the exercise group. Change of 3-hydroxybutric acid (r = -0.47, p = 0.025) and D-glucopyranose (r = -0.54, p = 0.006) correlated negatively with SE in the diet group. On the other hand, oxalic acid (r = 0.49, p = 0.021), D-glucopyranose (r = 0.43, p = 0.048), 4-deoxyerythronic acid (r = 0.60, p = 0.004) and tagatose (r = 0.51, p = 0.016) correlated positively with change of SOL, and 2-keto-isovaleric acid (r = 0.45, p = 0.029) correlated with TST in the diet group. 
Conclusion: In conclusion, this study identified circulating metabolites that may represent a part of a biological mechanism through which lifestyle interventions are associated with improved sleep quality in people with insomnia.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026898v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026898v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"Deep learning Enables Accurate Diagnosis of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) with CT images","Background
A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged recently as an acute respiratory syndrome. The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images.   

Materials and Methods
We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. Based on the collected dataset, a deep learning-based CT diagnosis system (DeepPneumonia) was developed to identify patients with COVID-19.

Results
The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from others with an excellent AUC of 0.99 and recall (sensitivity) of 0.93. In addition, our model was capable of discriminating the COVID-19 infected patients and bacteria pneumonia-infected patients with an AUC of 0.95, recall (sensitivity) of 0.96. Moreover, our model could localize the main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is of great help to assist doctors in diagnosis. The diagnosis for a patient could be finished in 30 seconds, and the implementation on Tianhe-2 supercompueter enables a parallel executions of thousands of tasks simultaneously. An online server is available for online diagnoses with CT images by http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/server/Ncov2019.

Conclusions
The established models can achieve a rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 in human samples, thereby allowing identification of patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026930v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026930v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Radiology and Imaging

Characterisation and Folate receptor-a (FR-a) targeting verification of ZW-FA were performed first and 92 patients were recruited, after liquid-based cytology preparations, during a 15-month period. ZW-FA and Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining were performed on all cytological slides successively; the histological diagnoses were regarded as the gold standard for ROC curve analysis. The cut-off value of ZW-FA fluorescence intensity is 62.9745; the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), false-negative rate (FNR), false-positive rate (FPR), positive predictive value (PV+) percentage and negative predictive value (PV-) of the ZW-FA method are 84.6%, 85.2%, 15.4%,14.8%, 93.2% and 69.7%, respectively.

"Evidence of accelerated epigenetic aging in patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease: Results of the LipidCardio study","DNA methylation (DNAm) age acceleration, defined as the deviation of chronological and epigenetic age determined by an epigenetic clock, has been proposed as a biomarker of biological aging. To address the above hypothesis in the context of cardiovascular disease, we evaluated whether patients (N=827, mean chronological age: 69.82+/-11.01 years, DNAm age: 71.91+/-16.11, residual DNAm age acceleration: 0.00+/-9.65 years), who were diagnosed with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) by coronary angiography were aged prematurely, i.e. had an increase in the DNAm age acceleration, in comparison with patients for whom obstructive CAD was ruled out (controls).
Stratified analysis yielded a significant acceleration in DNAm age (determined by a seven cytosine-phosphate-guanine epigenetic clock) in patients diagnosed with obstructive CAD, defined by at least one >50% coronary stenosis (N=588, rDNA age acceleration=0.58+/-9.47, corrected p= 2.05x10-3) compared to control subjects (N=145, residual (r)DNAm age acceleration= -3.11+/-10.51 years). Moreover, rDNAm age acceleration was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure (beta=0.069, 95% CI 0.027 - 0.112, p= 1.44x10-3), sex (beta=-2.438, 95% CI -4.591 - -0.285, p= 2.65x10-2), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, beta=0.040, 95% CI 0.011 - 0.069, p= 6.87x10-9) and smoking status (beta=-8.538, 95% CI -10.772 - -6.303, p= 2,45x10-13). 
 Across studies, assessing CAD and its risk factors in the context of epigenetic age acceleration findings are remarkably inconclusive. While the here employed seven-cytosine-phosphate-guanine epigenetic clock suggests premature biological aging in CAD patients, compared to controls without coronary stenosis, its association with cardiovascular risk factors was limited.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026906v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026906v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Recovering Mandibular Morphology after Disease with Artificial Intelligence","Mandibular tumors and radical oral cancer surgery often cause bone dysmorphia and defects. Most patients present with noticeable mandibular deformations, and doctors often have difficulty determining their exact mandibular morphology. In this study, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) called CTGAN is proposed to complete 3D mandibular cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) data from CT data. After extensive training CTGAN was tested on 6 mandibular tumor cases, resulting in 3D virtual mandibular completion. We found that CTGAN can generate mandibles with different levels and rich morphology, including positional and angular changes and local patterns.

The 3D generated mandibles have the anatomical morphology of the real mandibles and transition smoothly to the portions without disease, showing that CTGAN constructs mandibles with the expected patient characteristics and is suitable for mandibular morphological completion.

"Applying chemical reaction transition theory to predict the latent transmission dynamics of coronavirus outbreak in China","The recent outbreak of the Covid-19 suggests a rather long latent phase that precludes public health officials to predict the pandemic transmission on time. Here we apply mass action laws and chemical transition theory to propose a kinetic model that accounts for viral transmission dynamics at the latent phase. This model is useful for authorities to make early preventions and control measurements that stop the spread of a deadly new virus.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026815v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026815v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics of 91 Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang, China: A retrospective, multi-centre case series","OBJECTIVE 
To reveal more data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients outside of Wuhan, from five hospitals in east of Zhejiang province, China. 
DESIGN 
Retrospective case series. 
SETTING 
Five hospitals in east of Zhejiang province, China. 
PARTICIPANTS 
88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to hospital. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES 
A team of physicians who had been treating these patients extracted and recorded the exposure history, clinical symptoms, chest computed tomography and laboratory findings from medical records and sent the data to the working group in Ningbo to review and calculate. 
RESULTS 
Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission. In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple.
The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%). The median of incubation period was 6 (IQR, 3-8) days and the median time from first visit to a doctor to confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1-2) days. According to the Chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia, and 27.47% cases showed unilateral pneumonia. 
CONCLUSION
Social activity cluster, family cluster and travel by airplane were how COVID-19 patients get transmitted and could be rapidly diagnosed COVID-19 in Zhejiang.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026856v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026856v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"A Peptide-based Magnetic Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassay for Serological Diagnosis of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","A respiratory illness has been spreading rapidly in China, since its outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province in December 2019. The illness was caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from no symptom to fatal pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named the diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real time RT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods, quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc. Variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of this assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of this assay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197/276) and 57.2% (158/276) respectively. By combining with real time RT-PCR detection, this assay might help to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026617v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026617v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Fasting alters the gut microbiome with sustained blood pressure and body weight reduction in metabolic syndrome patients","Periods of fasting and refeeding may reduce cardiometabolic risk elevated by Western diet. We show that in hypertensive metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients (n=35), a 5-day fast followed by a modified DASH diet (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension) reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP), antihypertensive medication need, and body-mass index (BMI) at three months post intervention compared to a modified DASH diet alone (n=36). Fasting altered the gut microbiome, impacting bacterial taxa and gene modules associated with short-chain fatty acid production. Cross-system analyses revealed a positive correlation of circulating mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, non-classical monocytes and CD4+ effector T cells with SBP. Furthermore, regulatory T cells (Tregs) positively correlated with BMI and weight. Machine learning could predict sustained SBP-responsiveness within the fasting group from baseline immunome data, identifying CD8+ effector T cells, Th17 cells and Tregs as important contributors to the model. The high-resolution multi-omics data highlights fasting as a promising non-pharmacological intervention in MetS.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20027029v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20027029v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, February 2020","The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that has spread widely in China since December 2019 is now generating local transmission in several countries including Singapore of February 19, 2020. This highlights the need to monitor transmission potential of unfolding SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in real time. In particular, five major COVID-19 clusters have emerged in Singapore. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, for Singapore from the daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays, using a generalized growth model and employing a renewal equation. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. As of February 19th, 2020, our results indicate that the mean effective reproduction number Rt is at 1.1 (95% CI: 1.1,1.3) while an estimate of Rt based on cluster size distribution is at 0.63 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.05). These estimates underscore positive impact of containment efforts in Singapore while at the same time suggest the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026435v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026435v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Epidemiology

"Establishing Clinically Significant Patient-reported Outcomes for Diverticular Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study","Background & Aims:
Diverticular disease can undermine health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The diverticulitis quality of life (DV-QOL) instrument was designed and validated to measure the patient-reported burden of diverticular disease. However, in order for the DV-QOL to capture longitudinal outcomes, values reflecting meaningful improvement (i.e., minimal clinically important difference (MCID)) and the patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) need to be established.  We sought to establish the MCID and PASS of the DV-QOL, and describe the characteristics of those with DV-QOL above the PASS threshold.
Methods:
We performed a prospective cohort study of adults with diverticular disease from 7 centers in Washington and California (2016-2018). Patients were surveyed at baseline, then quarterly up to 30 months. To determine the PASS for DV-QOL, we used an anchor-based approach and performed receiver operating characteristic analyses using baseline data. A range of MCID values were calculated using distribution-based and anchor-based approaches.    
Results:
The study included 177 patients (mean age 57, 43% female).  A PASS threshold of 3.2/10 distinguished between those with and without HRQoL-impacting diverticulitis with acceptable accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) 0.76). A change of 2.2 points in the DV-QOL was the most appropriate MCID: above the measurement error and corresponding to patient perception of importance of change (AUC 0.70). Patients with DV-QOL=PASS were more often male, younger, had Medicaid, less educated, and had more serious episodes of diverticulitis.
Conclusion:
Our study is the first to define MCID and PASS for DV-QOL. These thresholds are critical for measuring the impact of diverticular disease and the evaluation of treatment effectiveness.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026427v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026427v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Gastroenterology

"Trends in Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus-infected Pneumonia in Wuhan and 29 Provinces in China","Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (COVID- 19) represents a significant public health threat. The COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health in- tervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling.
Method: Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from January 20, 2020 to Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R_t) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty.
Findings: We estimated that R_t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes which be- came stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan.
Interpretation: Public health interventions implemented at both the so- cial and personal levels are effective in preventing outbreaks of COVID-19 in Wuhan and other provinces. Model prediction results suggested that COVID- 19 will be contained around the end of February 2020 in China.

"The HOSPITAL score and LACE index for predicting the risk of hospital readmission do not show sex discrimination in a retrospective study.","Introduction: 
The perceived absence of human implicit and explicit biases, scalability, and the potential for rapid improvement with algorithmic decision-making systems make compelling arguments for the widespread use of this technology.   Unfortunately, real-world performance of some algorithmic decision-making systems demonstrates the reinforcement of discriminatory human biases in a way that is hidden from the human user.  This study aims to retrospectively investigate if the widely used HOSPITAL score and LACE index used to predict hospital readmissions exhibit bias on the basis of sex.  
Materials and Methods:
All adult medical patients discharged from the SIU-School of Medicine (SIU-SOM) Hospitalist service from Memorial Medical Center from January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2017, were studied retrospectively to determine if patient sex had an influence on the ability of the HOSPTIAL score and LACE index to predict the likelihood of any cause hospital readmission within 30 days.  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed comparing risk prediction tool performance by sex by measuring the area under the curve (AUC).  
Results: 
The analysis includes data for the 1781 discharges for 1410 individual patients that met inclusion criteria.   Of these discharges, 456 (27%) were readmitted to the same hospital within 30 days.  The overall study population was 47% women, had an average age of 63 years and spent an average of 7.9 days in the hospital.  Comparison of the performance of the LACE index in women and men showed no differences between AUCs (0.565 and 0.578, p = 0.613) and an ABROCA of 0.013.  Sensitivity (67% and 70%), specificity (46% and 46%), PPV (30% and 31%), NPV (80% and 82%) and accuracy (51% and 52%) for the LACE index are very similar for women and men.  
Comparison of the performance of the HOSPITAL in women and men showed no differences between AUCs (0.56 and 0.58, p = 0.407) and an ABROCA of 0.008 indicating highly similar performance.  Sensitivity (16% and 21%), specificity (96% and 95%), PPV (59% and 57%), NPV (77% and 78%) and accuracy (76% and 76%) for the HOSPITAL score are very similar for women and men.
Discussion and Conclusions:
The performance of the HOSPITAL and LACE readmission risk prediction tools appears to have equivalent performance when used for women or men in this small, single-center, retrospective study.  Further research is needed to explore the potential of bias and discrimination on risk prediction tools used in healthcare.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026740v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026740v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Health Informatics

"Dermal trypanosomes in suspected and confirmed cases of gambiense Human African Trypanosomiasis.","Background
The diagnosis of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) typically involves two steps: a serological screen, followed by the detection of living trypanosome parasites in the blood or lymph node aspirate. Live parasites can, however, remain undetected in some seropositive individuals, who we hypothesize are infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense parasites in their extravascular dermis.
Methods and findings
To test this hypothesis, we conducted a prospective observational cohort study in the gambiense HAT (gHAT) focus of Forecariah, in the Republic of Guinea. 5,417 subjects in this disease foci underwent serological screening for gHAT. Of these individuals, 66 were enrolled into our study, of whom 40 were seronegative, 8 were seropositive but unconfirmed, and 18 confirmed gHAT cases. Enrolled individuals underwent a dermatological examination, and had blood samples and skin biopsies taken and examined for trypanosomes by molecular and immuno-histological methods. In confirmed cases, dermatological symptoms were significantly more frequent, relative to seronegative controls. T. b. gambiense parasites were present in the blood of all confirmed cases but not in unconfirmed seropositive individuals. However, trypanosomes were detected in the dermis of all unconfirmed seropositive individuals and confirmed cases. After 6 and 20 months of treatment, dermal trypanosome numbers in skin biopsies of confirmed cases progressively reduced. 
Conclusions
Our results thus highlight the skin as a potential reservoir for trypanosomes, with implications for our understanding of this disease's epidemiology in the context of its planned elimination and highlighting the skin as a novel target for gHAT diagnostics.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026211v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026211v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"The effect of climate change on Yellow Fever disease burden in Africa","Yellow Fever (YF) is an arbovirus capable of causing haemorrhagic fever which is endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America. In recent years, it has resurged leading to large outbreaks and expanding its endemic zone, the causes of which are unknown. In Africa, the disease is currently considered endemic in 34 countries where it is estimated to cause 78,000 deaths a year. As the mosquito vectors of YF sensitive to environmental conditions, climate change may have substantial effects on the transmission of YF. Here we present the first analysis of the potential impact of climate change on YF transmission and disease burden. We extend an existing model of YF transmission in Africa to account for rainfall and a temperature suitability index. From this, we project transmission intensity across the African endemic region in the context of four climate change scenarios (representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5). We use these transmission projections to assess the change from current to future disease burden in 2050 and 2070 for each emission scenario. We find that disease burden changes heterogeneously with temperature and rainfall across the region. In RCP 2.6, we find a 93.0% [95% CI 92.7, 93.2%] chance that deaths will increase in 2050. We find that the annual expected number of deaths may increase by between 10.8% [95% CrI -2.4, 37.9%] for RCP 2.6 and 24.9% [95% CrI -2.2, 88.3%] for RCP 8.5 in 2050, with the most notable changes occurring in East and Central Africa. Changes in temperature and rainfall will affect the transmission dynamics of YF. Such a change in epidemiology will complicate future control efforts. As such, we may need to consider the effect of changing climactic variables on future intervention strategies.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20026369v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20026369v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

The specificities of the COVID-19 antibodies were assessed by Western Blot analysis against NPs from COVID-19, MERS and SARS. Antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry staining of the tissue sections from COVID-19 infected patient, as a potential diagnostic tool. A Sandwich ELISA kit was quickly assembled for quantitation of the virus/NP of COVID-19 concentrations in the vaccine preparations.

"Higher severity and mortality in male patients with COVID-19 independent of age and susceptibility","Objective: The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Disease (COVID-19) has put the world on alert, that is reminiscent of the SARS outbreak seventeen years ago. We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment.
Methods: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003.
Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (=65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P<0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P<0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, P= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with SARS.
Conclusion: Older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with COVID. While men and women have the same susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026864v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026864v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Patient-Perceived Facilitators and Barriers to Home-Based Rehabilitation Exercise and General Physical Activity after Total Hip Arthroplasty","Abstract 
Background. Recent systematic reviews suggest that outpatient supervised and home-based rehabilitation exercise after total hip arthroplasty (THA) are equally effective. But there is a lack of knowledge concerning patients perspectives on rehabilitation after THA. 
Objectives. To explore patient-perceived facilitators and barriers to home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after THA. The aim of this study is to contribute to the scientific basis for future organization of rehabilitation after THA.
Design. A qualitative study embedded in the trial: Pragmatic Home-based Exercise after Total Hip Arthroplasty, Silkeborg (PHETHAS-1), which was pre-registered on March 27, 2017 at Clinical Trials.gov (ID:NCT03109821).
Methods. Twenty-two semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with patients who had undergone THA surgery. Thematic analysis was undertaken, and emergent themes and subthemes were categorized using the lens of critical psychology.
Findings. Facilitating factors were related to Return to the well-known everyday life. A natural orientation toward general physical activity. Interaction with nature, and An obligation to health professionals and to oneself. Barriers were related to Pain. Boring exercises, and A feeling of distant rehabilitation.
Conclusions. Our findings indicate that everyday life is of great importance to the participants and that they have a desire to return to living the way they did before their hips restricted their functioning. Home-based rehabilitation exercise can be used as a means to reach this goal. Contact with health professionals has a beneficial impact on participants adherence to home-based rehabilitation exercise because their participation is facilitating by being a part of a mandatory co-operation. All participants in this study favored general physical activity over home-based rehabilitation exercise.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20025056v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20025056v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy

"SARS-CoV-2 transmission in cancer patients of a tertiary hospital in Wuhan","In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia known as 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. This new type of pneumonia is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Among the different disease types, cancer patients are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance, and the majority of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive.  This prompts us to consider if cancer patients were at an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
A total of 1,524 cancer patients who were managed at our tertiary cancer institution-Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were reviewed during the period of Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020. It was found that cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 than the general population. We identified twelve patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with two recorded deaths (16.7%), albeit one patient passed away from a COVID-19 unrelated cause. Interestingly, only five of these patients were ongoing treatment at the time of contracting the virus, suggesting that hospital visitation was the likely factor contributing to the elevated incidence in cancer patients. Moreover, we also observed that the incidence of severe COVID-19 was not higher than in the general population. Consequently, for cancer patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025320v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025320v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Oncology

As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach. Government action to immediately enforce this quarantine is highly recommended.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026773v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026773v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Epidemiology

"Temperature significant change COVID-19 Transmission in 429 cities","Background 

There is no evidence supporting that temperature changes COVID-19 transmission.

Methods
We collected the cumulative number of confirmed cases of all cities and regions affected by COVID-19 in the world from January 20 to February 4, 2020, and calculated the daily means of the average, minimum and maximum temperatures in January. Then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships.


Results
There were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in China and 26 overseas countries. In total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from Hubei Province. The lgN rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72<U+2103> and then slowly declined. The apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70<U+2103> and 12.42<U+2103> respectively. The curves shared similar shapes. Under the circumstance of lower temperature, every 1<U+2103> increase in average, minimum and maximum temperatures led to an increase of the cumulative number of cases by 0.83, 0.82 and 0.83 respectively. In the single-factor model of the higher-temperature group, every 1<U+2103> increase in the minimum temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases by 0.86. 

Conclusion 
The study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan. It is suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature in the world adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025791v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025791v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Can routine laboratory tests discriminate 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia from other community-acquired pneumonia?","Background. The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP.
Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability.
Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone.
Conclusions. Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the diagnosis of NCIP. Application of laboratory tests may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients when they present with unexplained febrile respiratory illnesses.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20024711v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20024711v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Clinical characteristics of 25 death cases infected with COVID-19 pneumonia: a retrospective review of medical records in a single medical center, Wuhan, China","Summary
Background The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious disease, which was occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. As of February 13, 2020, a total of 59883 cases of COVID-19 in China have been confirmed and 1368 patients have died from the disease. However, the clinical characteristics of the dyed patients were still not clearly clarified. This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality. 

Methods The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data.

Findings The mean age of the dead was 71.48  years, the average course of the disease was 10.56  days, all patients eventually died of respiratory failure. All of those who died had underlying diseases, the most common of which was hypertension (16/25, 64%), followed by diabetes (10/25, 40%), heart diseases (8/25, 32%), kidney diseases (5/25, 20%), cerebral infarction (4/25, 16%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 2/25, 8%), malignant tumors (2/25, 8%) and acute pancreatitis (1/25, 4%). The most common organ damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. In the patients' last examination before death, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in 17 patients (17/25, 68%) and 18 patients (18/25, 72%), lymphocyte counts were decreased in 22  patients (22/25, 88%). Most patients' PCT, CRP and SAA levels were elevated, the percentages were 90.5% (19/21), 85% (19/20) and 100% (21/21) respectively. The levels of the last test of neutrophils (15/16, 93.8%), PCT (11/11, 100%), CRP (11/13, 84.6%), cTnI (8/9, 88.9%), D-Dimer (11/12, 91.6%) and LDH (9/9, 100%) were increased as compared to the first test, while the levels of lymphocytes were decreased (14/16, 87.5%). 

Interpretation The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage  was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-Dimer and LDH levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025239v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025239v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Relationship Between Liver Cancer Mortality and Racial Residential Segregation Across Wisconsin Metropolitan Areas","Purpose: This study tested relationships between racial segregation and liver cancer across several different metropolitan areas in Wisconsin.
Methods: Tract level liver cancer mortality rates in Wisconsin were calculated using cases from 2003-2012. Hotspot analysis was conducted and segregation scores in high, low, and baseline mortality tracts were compared with ANOVA. Spatial regression analysis was done controlling for socioeconomic advantage and rurality.
Results: Black isolation scores were significantly higher in high mortality tracts compared to baseline and low mortality tracts, but stratification by metropolitan areas found this relationship was driven by two of the five metropolitan areas. Hispanic isolation was predictive for higher mortality in regression analysis, but this effect was not found across all metropolitan areas.
Conclusions: This study showed associations between liver cancer mortality and racial segregation, but found this relationship was not generalizable to all metropolitan areas in the study area.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026039v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026039v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Epidemiology

"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV: a system review","Background:  In this article, we summarized the early epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of SARS and COVID-19 in different countries. Aim to provide recommendations for the understanding and prevention of COVID-19. 
Methods: By searching pubmed, we analyzed and compared the typical cases of SARS and COVID-19 in different countries in the early stage of the outbreak. Clinical records, laboratory results, imageological diagnosis and pathologic condition were retrospectively reviewed for these cases. This paper adopts the method of descriptive statistics and tables and graphs.
Findings: Six SARS-related articles (N=337 participants) and 12 COVID-19-related articles (N=50,096 participants) were eligible for this systematic review. Fever, cough and Malaise/Fatigue were the most common symptoms in SARS and COVID-19. But in general, the clinical symptoms and signs of COVID-19 were not obvious. Compared with SARS, COVID-19 was transmitted in a more diverse way, from person to person, asymptomatic infected people and possible fecal-oral transmission, created the conditions for a large-scale spread. The mortality rates of SARS and COVID-19 were (7.7%) and (2.2%) respectively, but the overall infection rate of healthcare worker of COVID-19 (3.9%) was lower than that of SARS (40.0%). We also summarize the current reports on the pathology of COVID-19, we found that the pathological features of COVID-19 have greatly similar with SARS, which manifested as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Interpretation: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS and COVID-19 in China are very similar, but also difference. In general, COVID-19 is transmitted in more diverse ways and is more infectious, so the early recognition of disease by healthcare worker and patient is very important. Active and effective isolation measures for suspected and close contacts are necessary.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025601v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025601v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Neurological Manifestations of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective case series study","OBJECTIVE:
To study the neurological manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
DESIGN:
Retrospective case series
SETTING:
Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China.
PARTICIPANTS:
Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists.
RESULTS:
Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7  15.0 years vs 48.9  14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 [32.5%]), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%]), and showed less typical symptoms such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%]) and cough (30 [34.1%] vs 77 [61.1%]). Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations. More severe patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%]), such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]) and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]).
CONCLUSION:
Compared with non-severe patients with COVID-19, severe patients commonly had neurologic symptoms manifested as acute cerebrovascular diseases, consciousness impairment and skeletal muscle symptoms.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026500v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026500v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Intrinsic growth rules of patients infected, dead and cured with 2019 novel coronavirus in mainland China","Background
An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) was first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread rapidly to other regions. It has been declared that at least one confirmed case infected by SARS-CoV-2 was found in each province of China by late January 2020.
Methods
We collected the time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland China. A simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19. Furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19 in Hubei with that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, which was obtained from the Ministry of Public Health of China in 2003. 
Results
The feature of data of three population groups in all the provinces could be well captured (R-square>0.95) by the proposed descriptive model with slight variation among different provinces. By comparing fitted parameters, we found that the fitted curve of the infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period in both COVID-19 and SARS. While all three population groups of SARS are later to saturate and have a longer semi-saturation period than that of COVID-19.
Conclusions
Our model is robust and stable to depict the intrinsic growth rule for the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases in 30 provinces, which could depict the epidemic situation in mainland China very well. Despite the virus caused SARS (SARS-CoV) and the virus caused COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are homologous, their epidemiologic characteristics are quite different. The duration of the outbreak would be shorter for COVID-19.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20024802v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20024802v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Epidemiology

"Estimating the serial interval of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A statistical analysis using the public data in Hong Kong from January 16 to February 15, 2020","Backgrounds: The emerging virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a large outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China since December 2019. Based on the publicly available surveillance data, we identified 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong and estimated the serial interval (SI) of COVID-19.
Methods: Index cases were identified and reported after symptoms onset, and contact tracing was conducted to collect the data of the associated secondary cases. An interval censored likelihood framework is adopted to fit a Gamma distribution function to govern the SI of COVID-19. 
Findings: Assuming a Gamma distributed model, we estimated the mean of SI at 4.4 days (95%CI: 2.9-6.7) and SD of SI at 3.0 days (95%CI: 1.8-5.8) by using the information of all 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong. 
Conclusion: The SI of COVID-19 may be shorter than the preliminary estimates in previous works. Given the likelihood that SI could be shorter than the incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission may occur, and extra efforts on timely contact tracing and quarantine are recommended in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026559v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026559v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Epidemiology

"Polygenic modulation of lipoprotein(a)-associated cardiovascular risk","Aims: Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) are one of the strongest inherited risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, there is variability in cardiovascular risk among individuals with elevated lipoprotein(a). The sources of this variability are incompletely understood. We assessed the effects of a genomic risk score (GRS) for CAD on risk of myocardial infarction among individuals with elevated lipoprotein(a).
Methods: We calculated CAD GRSs for 408,896 individuals of British white ancestry from the UK Biobank using 6.27 million common genetic variants. Lipoprotein(a) levels were measured in 310,020 individuals. The prevalence and risk of myocardial infarction versus CAD GRS percentiles were compared for individuals with and without elevated lipoprotein(a) defined as =120 or 168 nmol/L (50 or 70 mg/dL, respectively). 
Results: Individuals with elevated lipoprotein(a) displayed significantly greater CAD GRSs than individuals without elevated lipoprotein(a), which was largely dependent on the influence of genetic variants within or near the LPA gene. Continuous levels of CAD GRS percentile were significantly associated with risk of myocardial infarction for individuals with elevated lipoprotein(a). Notably, the risk of myocardial infarction for males with elevated lipoprotein(a) levels, but a CAD GRS percentile in the lower quintile (<20th percentile), was less than the overall risk of myocardial infarction for males with non-elevated lipoprotein(a) levels (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.79 [0.64-0.97], p=0.02). Similar results were observed for females.
Conclusion: These data suggest that CAD genomic scores influence cardiovascular risk among individuals with elevated lipoprotein(a) and may aid in identifying candidates for preventive therapies.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026757v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026757v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Conjunctival polymerase chain reaction-tests of 2019 novel coronavirus in patients in Shenyang,China","Purpose: The 2019 novel coronavirus(COVID-19) mainly transmitted by person-to-person through inhalation of respiratory droplets. We report the laboratory results of conjunctival PCR-tests and some clinical features of these patients in shenyang China.
Design: This is a cross-sectional non-randomized study.
Subjects: The study include 14 confirmly diagnosed cases, 16 suspected cases and some medical observed patients.
Methods:  All patients with diagnosed and suspected COVID-19 were admitted to a designated hospital in Shenyang,China. We  collected  conjunctival samples of these patients to do the laboratory tests by real time RT-PCR.Medical observed patients were enrolled if they had clinical symptoms. Then we analysed the PCR results and clinical data from eletronic medical records in order to find some relationships.
Main Outcome Measures: Clinical condition and PCR results of conjunctival swabs compared with other specimens.
Results:
One of the identified case coverted from suspected case without typical clinical symptoms. Twenty-two medical observed cases  were removed because none of them converted to identified cases.One of the suspected converted to identified case recently.The included cases in our study are imported cases with less underlying diseases and the severity of their infection was relatively moderate. All the conjunctival results of PCR-test were negative. Two cases had typical clinical symptoms but were finally confirmed by repeated pharynx swab tests.
Conclusion: Conjunctiva may be a transmission way of COVID-19. And ocular conjunctival swabs in combination with PCR test could be a non-invasive,convenient and feasible diagnostic method for identifying the infection of COVID-19. Emphasis on the false-negative results is vital.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20024935v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20024935v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Ophthalmology

"Pneumococcal colonization impairs nasal and lung mucosal immune responses to Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccination in adults","Influenza virus infections affect millions of people annually. Current available vaccines provide varying rates of protection. There is a knowledge gap on how the nasal microbiota, particularly established pneumococcal colonization, shapes the response to influenza vaccination. In this study, we inoculated healthy adults with live S. pneumoniae and vaccinated them three days later with either TIV or LAIV. Vaccine-induced immune responses were assessed in nose, blood and lung. Nasal pneumococcal colonization had no impact upon TIV-induced antibody responses to influenza, which manifested in all compartments. However, pre-existing pneumococcal colonization dampened LAIV-mediated mucosal antibody responses, primarily IgA in the nose and IgG in the lung. Pulmonary influenza-specific cellular responses were more apparent in the LAIV group compared to either TIV or an unvaccinated group. These results indicate that TIV and LAIV elicit differential immunity to adults and that LAIV immunogenicity is diminished by the nasal presence of S. pneumoniae. This important confounder should be considered when assessing LAIV efficacy.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20025098v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20025098v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease","Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains different types of extracellular vesicles (EVs) with undisclosed biomarker potential for neurodegenerative diseases. The aims of the present study were: i) to compare the proteome EVs isolated using different ultracentrifugation speed ii) to preliminary explore the EVs proteome in a common neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to neurological controls. CSF samples from control subjects and AD patients were pooled separately (15 mL) and subjected to ultracentrifugation (UC) at different speeds (20,000g and 100,000g) to isolate separate EV fractions (P20 and P100). The proteome was analysed using high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and comparisons were made using bioinformatic analysis. EVs isolated at 100,000g (P100) had a proteome consistent with vesicles secreted via an ESCRT-dependent mechanism, being highly enriched in alix (PDCD6IP), syntenin-1 (SDCBP) and TSG101. EVs isolated at 20,000g were substantially different, showing enrichment in cytoskeletal and cell adhesion molecules. The pools from patients diagnosed with AD showed a distinct protein profile of CSF EVs, with increased levels of ADAM10, SPON1, CH3IL1 and MDK in the P100 fraction. CSF EV offer a new potential biosource of protein markers for AD detection and a complementary framework to the analysis of whole biological fluids for biomarker discovery.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026609v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026609v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Neurology

"2019 novel coronavirus disease in hemodialysis (HD) patients: Report from one HD center in Wuhan, China","The outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan has become a global epidemic of contagious diseases, which poses a serious threat to human life and health, especially for those with underlined diseases. However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of  T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Nephrology

"Mental health status and coping strategy of medical workers in China during The COVID-19 outbreak","Abstract
Background: The impact of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic on mental health of medical workers, as well as its impact factors, remains unknown. We assessed symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia in medical workers and the effect of social support in China during COVID-19 epidemic.
Methods: We conducted this study using online questionnaires via a social networking software, Wechat, within a week from Feb 9th 2020 to Feb 15th 2020. Symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia were measured by Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), Chinese version of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and Insomnia Severity Index, respetively. The assessment of social support was measured by the Social Support Rating Scale.  
Results: Among all the 5393 respondents, anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms of the population accounted for 5.9%, 28% and 34.3% of the total sample group, respectively. Female, contact with confirmed or suspected cases, work in the clinical first-line, low social support total score and low score in each dimension, nurses and other factors are closely related to the occurrence of depression, anxiety, insomnia symptoms.After controlling the Statistically significant population characteristics variables, we found that the total score of social support and the score of three dimensions were protective factors for psychological problems.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026872v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026872v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Inferring transmission trees to guide targeting of interventions against visceral leishmaniasis and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis","Understanding of spatiotemporal transmission of infectious diseases has improved significantly in recent years. Advances in Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which novel estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyse longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on infectiousness of VL and PKDL, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: >85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were <300m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were <4 months for 90% of VL infectors, but up to 2.75yrs for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary VL cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0-6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced VL incidence by up to a quarter. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally-targeted interventions against VL.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20023325v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20023325v1.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Does in utero HIV-exposure and the early nutritional environment influence infant development and immune outcomes? Findings from a pilot study in Pretoria, South Africa.","Background: As mother-to-child-transmission of HIV decreases, and the population of infants who are born HIV-exposed, but uninfected (HEU) continues to rise, there is growing need to understand the development and health outcomes of infants who are HEU to ensure that they have the healthiest start to life. 

Methods: In a prospective cohort pilot study at Kalafong Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa, we aimed to determine if we could recruit new mothers living with HIV on antiretrovirals (ART; n=20) and not on ART (n=20), and new mothers without HIV (n=20) through our clinics to study the effects of HEU on growth, immune- and neuro-development in infants in early life, and test the hypothesis that infants who were HEU would have poorer health outcomes compared to infants who were HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU). We also undertook exploratory analyses to investigate relationships between the early nutritional environment, food insecurity, and infant development. Infant growth, neurodevelopment (Guide for Monitoring Child Development [GMCD]) and levels of monocyte subsets (CD14, CD16, and CCR2 expression [flow cytometry]) were measured in infants at birth and 12 weeks (range 8-16 weeks).  

Results: We recruited 33 women living with HIV on ART, and 22 women living without HIV within four days of delivery from June-December 2016. 21 women living with HIV and 10 without HIV returned for a follow-up appointment at 12 weeks postpartum. The high mobility of this population presented major challenges to participant retention. Preliminary analyses revealed lower head circumference and elevated CCR2+ (% and median fluorescence intensity) on monocytes at birth among infants who were HEU compared to HUU. Maternal reports of food insecurity were associated with lower maternal nutrient intakes at 12 weeks postpartum and increased risk of stunting at birth for infants who were HEU, but not infants who were HUU. 

Conclusions: Our small feasibility pilot study suggests that HEU may adversely affect infant development, and further, infants who are HEU may be even more vulnerable to the programming effects suboptimal nutrition in utero and postnatally. This pilot and preliminary analyses have been used to inform our research questions and protocol in our ongoing, full-scale study.","/content/10.1101/19003889v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003889v2.full.pdf","2020-02-25","HIV/AIDS

"Estimating the Efficacy of Traffic Blockage and Quarantine for the Epidemic Caused by 2019-nCoV (COVID-19)","Background: Since the 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk. The quarantine and traffic blockage can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections, henceforth evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine.

Method: We collected confirmed case data and the migration data, and introduced the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor to the Flow-SEIR model. By varying the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor, we simulated the change of the peak number and arrival time of infections, then the efficacy of these two intervation measures can be analyzed in our simulation. In our study,  the self-protection at home is also included in quarantine.

Results: In the simulated results, the quarantine and traffic blockage are effective for epidemic control. For Hubei province, the current quarantine factor is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who had flowed out from Hubei. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26. With the quarantine and traffic blockage factor increasing, the number of infections decrease dramatically. We also simulated the start dates of quarantine and traffic blockage at four time points, the simulated results show that the early of warning is also effective for epidemic containing. However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of infections. In general, the quarantine is much more effective than the traffic blockage control. 

Conclusion: Both of quarantine and traffic blockage are effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19. However, the eff  icacy of quarantine is found to be much stronger than that of traffic blockage. Considering traffic blockage may also cause huge losses of economy, we propose to gradually deregulate the traffic blockage, and improve quarantine instead. Also, there might be a large number of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19, the quarantine should be continued for a long time until the epidemic is totally under control.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022913v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022913v3.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Epidemiology

"Data-Based Analysis, Modelling and Forecasting of the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","Since the first suspected case of coronavirus diesease-2019 (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. 
Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data (WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC and DXY) for Hubei from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters, i.e. the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and the infection, recovery and mortality rates, along with their 90% confidence intervals. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a sample of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Our computations and analysis were based on a mean field Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 in both scenarios was found to be ~2.5, the one computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of the confirmed cases  was found to be ~4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ~3.2. Furthermore, on the estimated parameters from both scenarios, we provide tentative three-week forecasts of the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter.
Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected will surpass 80,000 (as a lower bound) and could reach 160,000 (with an upper bound of 330,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February data and estimations of the actual number of infected and recovered in the population, the death toll might exceed 7,000 by February 29. However, our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the mortality rate to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly it is due to the fact that the actual number of infected and recovered cases in the population is estimated to be more than twenty times higher than reported, thus resulting in a much lower mortality rate, which according  to our computations is of the order of ~0.15%.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186v2.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Development and Evaluation of A CRISPR-based Diagnostic For 2019-novel Coronavirus","Background: The recent outbreak of infections by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the third zoonotic CoV has raised great public health concern. The demand for rapid and accurate diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges. Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics.

Methods: 2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for this novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed and compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR). 

Results: 2019-nCoVs sequenced in our study were conserved with the Wuhan strain, and shared certain genetic similarity with SARS-CoV. A high degree of variation in the level of viral RNA was observed in clinical specimens. CRISPR-nCoV demonstrated a near single-copy sensitivity and great clinical sensitivity with a shorter turn-around time than RT-PCR.

Conclusion: CRISPR-nCoV presents as a promising diagnostic option for the emerging pathogen.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025460v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025460v2.full.pdf","2020-02-25",NA,"Hou","/highwire/citation/72626/bibtext",52,"270220-52","27-02-2020","72626"
"The efficacy of convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza","Background. Administration of convalescent plasma may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections. However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose convalescent plasma use in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza.
Methods. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. The primary outcome was case fatality rates by influenza.
Results. We identified 5 RCTs of severe influenza. The pooled analyses showed no evidence for a reduction in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.06; p = 0.87; I2 = 35%). We also found non significant reductions in days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. There seemed to have a biological benefit of increasing HAI titer levels and decreasing influenza B virus loads and cytokines after convalescent plasma treatment. No serious adverse events was reported between two groups. Studies were commonly of low risk of bias with high quality. 
Conclusions. Convalescent plasma appears safe but may not reduce mortality in severe influenza. This therapy should be studied within the context of a well designed clinical trial for treatment of SARS Cov 2 infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025593v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025593v2.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Effectiveness of control strategies for Coronavirus Disease 2019: a SEIR dynamic modeling study","Background: Since its first cases occurrence in Wuhan, China, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly to other provinces and neighboring countries. A series of intervention strategies have been implemented, but didn't stop its spread.
Methods: Two mathematical models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in the city of Wuhan and in other parts of China. Special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse). 
Findings: The basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated for the period between 18 January 2020 and 16 February 2020: R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area). At the same time, Wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February 2020. The number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area) peaked around February 3. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in Wuhan occurred on February 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on February 3. Concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases. The model further shows that the COVID-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the entire country. The five cities with top risk index in China with the exclusion of Wuhan are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city.
Interpretations: Although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. As the Return-to-Work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the COVID-19 in other cities outside of Wuhan.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025387v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025387v2.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Clinical characteristics of 50466 patients with 2019-nCoV infection","Objective: We aim to summarize reliable evidences of evidence-based medicine for the treatment and prevention of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV.
Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection were collected for Meta-analysis.
Results: Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 89.1%, the incidence of cough was 72.2%, and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 42.5%. The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 96.6%, the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 18.1%, and the case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was 4.3%.
Conclusion: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms only occur in a small number of patients.

"Violin plot data: A concerto of crucial information on valve thrombogenicity classified using laboratory measured valve motion","Objectives:
We hypothesize that prosthetic valve thrombogenic potential may be inferred by valve regional flow velocity. This metric was used to compare two clinical valves and two experimental prototypes. 
Methods: 
Four our clinical and experimental prototype valve models were tested in aortic and mitral sites under pulsatile circulation in a pulse duplicator. An optical approach measuring projected dynamic valve area to gauge valve motion was implemented. Pulsatile pressures and flow rates were measured by conventional techniques and a quasi-steady flow tester was used to measure valve leakage. Regurgitant flow velocity was derived using time-dependent volumetric flow rate / projected dynamic valve area. Since flow velocity and fluid shear force are related through flow velocity gradient, thrombogenic potential for valves that achieve near closure during the forward flow deceleration phase were determined as regurgitant flow velocities relative to the control mechanical valve regurgitant flow velocity of -126 m/s. Analysis of the flow velocity data made use of Vioplot R* and VISIO software packages to provide split violin plots that represent probability of recurrence of data. 
Results: Thrombogenic potential was made dimensionless and ranged between -0.45 and +1.0. Negative thrombogenic potentials arise when transient rebound of valve occluder is accompanied by water-hammer phenomena. Positive thrombogenic potentials occur during decelerating forward flow. Bioprostheses had lowest thrombogenic potential transient of 0.15. A mock-transcatheter aortic valve replacement incorporating by design a trivial paravalvular leak (~1.35 ml/s) demonstrated a high transient thrombogenic potential of 0.95. 
Conclusions: Our data reveals distinct thrombogenic potential profile differences between valve models. If our study methods are verifiable, the design of future valves may utilize currently available experimental tools to produce advanced devices with significantly reduced thrombogenic potential.","/content/10.1101/19009407v7?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19009407v7.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Clinical Characteristics of 24 Asymptomatic Infections with COVID-19 Screened among Close Contacts in Nanjing, China","Background:
Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers.

Methods:
Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. 
 
Findings:
None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Interpretation:
The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025619v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025619v2.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, February 2020","The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that has spread widely in China since December 2019 is now generating local transmission in several countries including Singapore of February 19, 2020. This highlights the need to monitor transmission potential of unfolding SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in real time. In particular, five major COVID-19 clusters have emerged in Singapore. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, for Singapore from the daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays, using a generalized growth model and employing a renewal equation. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. As of February 19th, 2020, our results indicate that the mean effective reproduction number Rt is at 1.1 (95% CI: 1.1,1.3) while an estimate of Rt based on cluster size distribution is at 0.63 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.05). These estimates underscore positive impact of containment efforts in Singapore while at the same time suggest the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026435v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026435v2.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Epidemiology

"Estimating the case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 epidemic in China","Background: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China since late December 2019. Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic.
Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 22 Feb 2020. Competing risk model was used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR was estimated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. 
Results: As of 22 Feb 2020, totally 77,041 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The CFR of COVID-19 were estimated to be 7.24% (95% CI: 6.61%-8.01%) in Hubei province, including Wuhan, the epicenter, and 1.00% (95% CI: 0.87%-1.18%) in other areas of China, respectively. We observed obvious decreasing trends of CFR for COVID-19, with three distinct turning points on January 30, February 6, and February 15 for Hubei province, and one turning point on February 8 for other areas, respectively.
Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China, over 7 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023630v4?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023630v4.full.pdf","2020-02-25","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Epidemiological Development of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in China and Its Forecast","ABSTRACT 
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
The novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) infected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was broken out in Wuhan and Hubei province for more than a month. It severely threats people's health of thousands in Chin and even other countries. In order to prevent its wide spread, it is necessary to understand the development of the epidemic with precise mathematical language. 
METHODS
   The various data of novel coronavirus pneumonia were collected from the official websites of the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China. According to epidemic and administrative division, three groups were divided to analyze the data, Hubei Province (including Wuhan), nationwide without Hubei and Henan Province. With classic SIR models, the fitting epidemiological curves of incidence have made, and basic reproduction number (R0) was also calculated as well. Therefore the disease's infection intensity, peak time and the epidemiological end time can be deduced.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026229v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026229v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Epidemiology

"Deep learning-based model for detecting 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography: a prospective study in 27 patients","Background: Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging method for evaluating lung infection in new coronavirus infection caused pneumonia. Our research aimed to construct a system based on deep learning for detecting 2019-nCoV pneumonia on high resolution CT, and relieve the working pressure of radiologists and potentially improve the efficiency of diagnosis. 
Methods: 21,661 CT scan images from 40 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients and 5,100 CT scan images from 24 non-2019-nCoV infected patients were collected to train convolutional neural network model to detect 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Eleven and thirty-one patients with and without 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected for retrospectively testing. Twenty-seven consecutive patients undergoing CT scans in Feb, 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were prospectively collected to evaluate and compare the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia with that of the model.
Findings: The model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy of 95.24%, PPV of 84.62%, and NPV of 100%; a per-image sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of 99.61% in retrospective dataset. For 27 prospective patients, the model achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist with much shorter reading time (41.34s [IQR 39.76-44.48] vs. 115.50s [IQR 85.69-118.17] per patient).
Interpretation: We have developed a deep learning model showing a comparable performance with expert radiologist using much shorter time. It holds great potential to improve the efficiency of diagnosis and relieve the pressure of radiologists in clinical practice.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20021568v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20021568v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Modeling Cerebral Hemodynamics Using BOLD Magnetic Resonance Imaging and its Application in Mild Cognitive Impairment","Objective: This study develops a procedure and related analytical methods for deriving indices of cerebral hemodynamics in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) setting using resting state recordings of systemic blood pressure, pulse rate, and end-tidal CO2 synchronized with the MRI image acquisitions of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) data as a measure of cerebral perfusion. Methods: We employed the concept of Principal Dynamic Modes (PDM) to model the effect of three determinants of cerebral perfusion: mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2), and pulse rate (PR). The relation between these signals and the BOLD signal were used respectively to quantify cerebral autoregulation (CA), CO2 vasoreactivity (CVR), and pulse rate reactivity (PRR). Results: Hemodynamic indices were obtained from 129 participants with normal cognition (NC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). CA was reduced in MCI compared to NC in the parietal lobe, CVR was reduced in MCI in the occipital and temporal lobes, and PRR was reduced in the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. Reduced CVR and PRR were associated with worse cognitive scores including memory and executive function. Conclusion: Employed acquisition and analysis of MRI hemodynamic identified cerebral hemodynamic alterations in MCI, related to PR and ETCO2 changes. Significance: This modeling approach may offer a novel way to clinically assess cerebral hemodynamics during MRI.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20018846v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20018846v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Neurology

"Untargeted Metabolomics Reveals Sugar and Homocysteine Dysregulations in Prodromal AD","Introduction: Altered metabolism may occur early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used untargeted high-resolution metabolomics in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to identify these alterations.
Methods: CSF from 92 normal controls and 93 MCI underwent untargeted metabolomics using high-resolution mass spectrometry with liquid chromatography. Partial least squares discriminant analysis was used followed by metabolite annotation and pathway enrichment analysis (PES). Significant features were correlated with disease phenotypes using spearman correlation.
Results: We identified 294 features differentially expressed between the 2 groups and 94 were annotated. PES showed that pathways related to sugar regulation (N-Glycan, p=0.0007; sialic acid, p=0.0014; Amino sugars, p=0.0042; galactose, p=0.0054) homocysteine regulation (p=0.0081) were differentially activated and significant features within these pathways correlated with disease phenotypes.
Conclusion: We identified a metabolic signature characterized by impairments in sugar and homocysteine regulation in prodromal AD. Targeting these changes may offer new therapeutic approaches to AD.

"Exploring the causal effect of hearing loss on Alzheimers disease: a Mendelian randomisation study","BACKGROUND: Hearing loss has been identified as one of the most important risk factors for Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the nature of this association has not been established. 
METHODS: We used GWAS data to construct genetic instruments for hearing difficulty and tested the effect of these on liability towards AD using two-sample Mendelian randomisation, followed by secondary sensitivity analyses. 
RESULTS: There was no strong evidence for a causal relationship between hearing difficulty and AD but the effect estimate was imprecise (ORFE-IVW 1.27, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.82, p=0.189). There was no evidence for the inverse effect (causal influence of AD on liability towards hearing loss). Power calculations indicated our instruments were sufficiently powered to detect the magnitude of effect described in case-control and cohort settings. 
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the observed relationship between hearing loss and AD cannot be completely accounted for by a direct causal influence.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20017525v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20017525v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Neurology

"TWIRLS, an automated topic-wise inference method based on massive literature, suggests a possible mechanism via ACE2 for the pathological changes in the human host after coronavirus infection","Faced with the current large-scale public health emergency, collecting, sorting, and analyzing biomedical information related to the ""coronavirus"" should be done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity. However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. After triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20025437v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20025437v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Usability of a Machine-Learning Clinical Order Recommender System Interface for Clinical Decision Support and Physician Workflow","Objective: To determine whether clinicians will use machine learned clinical order recommender systems for electronic order entry for simulated inpatient cases, and whether such recommendations impact the clinical appropriateness of the orders being placed.
Materials and Methods: 43 physicians used a clinical order entry interface for five simulated medical cases, with each physician-case randomized whether to have access to a previously-developed clinical order recommendation system. A panel of clinicians scored determined whether orders placed were clinically appropriate. Outcomes assessed included The primary outcome was the differences in clinical appropriateness scores, of orders for cases randomized to the recommender system. Secondary outcomes included usage metrics, and physician opinions.
Results: Clinical appropriateness scores for orders were comparable for cases randomized to the recommender system (mean difference -0.1 order per score, 95% CI:[-0.4, 0.2]). Physicians using the recommender placed more orders (mean 17.3 vs. 15.7 orders; incidence ratio 1.09, 95% CI:[1.01-1.17]). Case times were comparable with the recommender system. Order suggestions generated from the recommender system were more likely to match physician needs than standard manual search options. Approximately 95% of participants agreed the system would be useful for their workflows. 
Discussion: Machine-learned clinical order options can meet physician needs better than standard manual search systems. This may increase the number of clinical orders placed per case, while still resulting in similar overall clinically appropriate choices.
Conclusions: Clinicians can use and accept machine learned clinical order recommendations integrated into an electronic order entry interface. The clinical appropriateness of orders entered was comparable even when supported by automated recommendations.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20025890v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20025890v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Health Informatics

"A method to estimate the incidence of transfusion reaction for the transfusion-treating disease in Chinese hospital","Aims: To propose a method to help the clinical doctors to estimate the patients' probability of suffering transfusion reaction during or after the transfusion treatment. Background: Blood components could be regarded as drugs that may cause adverse reactions while the transfusion is a kind of therapeutic procedure. The incidence of adverse transfusion reaction (ATR) is about 2, so some ATR might be neglected by clinical doctors. The ATR may affects patients.prognosis and even causes life threatening problems if not treated quickly and effectively. So, it is necessary to assess the patients.risk of ATR before transfusion and it is very important for ATRs' prevention and management. Methods/materials: The 79 hospitals reported ATR covered most of the mainland in China except Xizang province. From May 2018 to June 2019, there were about 1500 ATR cases. By Apriori algorithm and complex network method, information of these cases were extracted. The diseases which most probable encounter transfusion reactions after transfusion were screened out and it would be possible to estimate the probability of transfusion reaction of the disease that needs transfusion treatment. Results: Even though the average incidence of ATR is about 2, i.e. on the order of 10^(-3), for cancer patients the incidence of transfusion reaction is at least on the order of 10^(-2). And diseases of blood and hematopoietic organs, partus and puerperium, the incidence of transfusion reaction might be higher than the order of 10^(-3). The gastrointestinal hemorrhage patients need repeated transfusion, however their incidence of ATR might be around the order of 10^(-3). This means that even though we have thought the history of transfusion might increase the incidence of ATR, it does not increase the incidence significantly. Conclusion: The incidence of ATR in different groups of patients are different. For instance, in the 0-19 age group, cancer patients transfused by platelet the incidence is higher than 1% much higher than the average incidence. The ATR incidence among the gastrointestinal hemorrhage patients transfused by plasma is higher than 0.9. And most of the patients in this group also have the history of transfusion. So the transfusion history might increase the ATR incidence, however, it depends on the patients' condition, including the disease they are suffering. Evaluating the patients' condition before transfusion is important. In this study we have proposed a method to valuate the patients' condition before transfusion. Clinical doctors might use the method to estimate the detailed incidence of ATR in their hospital. This might be helpful to prevent the ATR to some extent.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20026096v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20026096v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Epidemiology

"Influence of serosorting and intervention-mediated changes in serosorting on the population-level HIV transmission impact of pre-exposure prophylaxis among men who have sex with men: a mathematical modelling study","Background: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may change serosorting patterns. We examined the influence of serosorting on the population-level HIV transmission impact of PrEP, and how impact could change if PrEP users stopped serosorting. 

Methods: We developed a compartmental HIV transmission model parameterized with bio-behavioural and HIV surveillance data among men who have sex with men in Canada. We separately fit the model with serosorting and without serosorting (random partner-selection proportional to availability by HIV-status (sero-proportionate)), and reproduced stable HIV epidemics (2013-2018) with HIV-prevalence 10.3%-24.8%, undiagnosed fraction 4.9%-15.8%, and treatment coverage 82.5%-88.4%. We simulated PrEP-intervention reaching stable coverage by year-1 and compared absolute difference in relative HIV-incidence reduction 10-year post-intervention (PrEP-impact) between: models with serosorting vs. sero-proportionate mixing; and scenarios in which PrEP users stopped vs. continued serosorting. We examined sensitivity of results to PrEP-effectiveness (44%-99%) and coverage (10%-50%).

Findings: Models with serosorting predicted a larger PrEP-impact compared with models with sero-proportionate mixing under all PrEP-effectiveness and coverage assumptions (median (inter-quartile-range): 8.1%(5.5%-11.6%)). PrEP users' stopping serosorting reduced PrEP-impact compared with when PrEP users continued serosorting: reductions in PrEP-impact were minimal (2.1%(1.4%-3.4%)) under high PrEP-effectiveness (86%-99%); however, could be considerable (10.9%(8.2%-14.1%)) under low PrEP effectiveness (44%) and high coverage (30%-50%). 
 
Interpretation: Models assuming sero-proportionate mixing may underestimate population-level HIV-incidence reductions due to PrEP. PrEP-mediated changes in serosorting could lead to programmatically-important reductions in PrEP-impact under low PrEP-effectiveness (e.g. poor adherence/retention). Our findings suggest the need to monitor sexual mixing patterns to inform PrEP implementation and evaluation.

"Machine Learning Assisted Intraoperative Assessment of Brain Tumor Margins Using HRMAS NMR Spectroscopy","Complete resection of the tumor is important for survival in glioma patients. Even if the gross total resection was achieved, left-over micro-scale tissue in the excision cavity risks recurrence. High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HRMAS NMR) technique can distinguish healthy and malign tissue efficiently using peak intensities of biomarker metabolites. The method is fast, sensitive and can work with small and unprocessed samples, which makes it a good fit for real-time analysis during surgery. However, only a targeted analysis for the existence of known tumor biomarkers can be made and this requires a technician with chemistry background, and a pathologist with knowledge on tumor metabolism to be present during surgery. Here, we show that we can accurately perform this analysis in real-time and can analyze the full spectrum in an untargeted fashion using machine learning. We work on a new and large HRMAS NMR dataset of glioma and control samples (n  = 568), which are also labeled with a quantitative pathology analysis. Our results show that a random forest based approach can distinguish samples with tumor cells and controls accurately and effectively with a mean AUC of 85.6% and AUPR of 93.4%. We also show that we can further distinguish benign and malignant samples with a mean AUC of 87.1% and AUPR of 96.1%. We analyze the feature (peak) importance for classification to interpret the results of the classifier. We validate that known malignancy biomarkers such as creatine and 2-hydroxyglutarate play an important role in distinguish tumor and normal cells and suggest new biomarker regions.

"Incidence of dysphagia and associated pneumonia in stroke patient from India: A systematic review","Background: India has high incidence (116-163 per 100,000) of stroke compared to western countries. Stroke is reported to be the fourth leading cause of death and fifth leading cause of disability in India. Dysphagia is seen approximately in half of the stroke patients and if unidentified may result in pulmonary complications such as aspiration pneumonia. However, there is no estimate of post stroke dysphagia and associated pneumonia in India. 
Method: Using the PRISMA methodology, a systematic search for recent literature on dysphagia in stroke was carried out across all the major databases. Two authors independently screened the titles and the abstracts, and those selected articles were assessed for quality using the GRADE approach. Comparisons were made of reported dysphagia and pneumonia frequencies, the relative risks of developing pneumonia were calculated. Data on duration of hospital stay and rates of mortality were also extracted. 
Results: We identified 86 citations, out of which only four articles were deemed eligible for critical analyses and data extraction. A high incidence (11.1% - 87.5%) of dysphagia was observed among stroke patients. Only two studies reported on incidence of pneumonia (22.8% - 32%); only one study stratified patients by both dysphagia and pneumonia. A relative risk of 5.82 (95% CI 4.6, 7.2) was found for pneumonia in patients with stroke and dysphagia. Data on length of hospital stay and rates of mortality secondary to aspiration pneumonia are also presented. 
Conclusion: Despite high incidence of dysphagia and associated pneumonia the methodological quality of studies are low. There is a dire need for methodologically sound studies to accurate determine the incidence of dysphagia and its impact on stroke patients in India.

"Survival Outcomes are Associated with Genomic Instability in Luminal Breast Cancers","Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death among women. Breast cancers are generally diagnosed and treated based on clinical and histopathological features, along with subtype classification determined by the Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay (also known as PAM50). Currently the copy number alteration (CNA) landscape of the tumour is not considered. We set out to examine the role of genomic instability (GI) in breast cancer survival since CNAs reflect GI and correlate with survival in other cancers. We focussed on the 70% of breast cancers classified as luminal and carried out a comprehensive survival and association analysis using Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) data to determine whether CNA burden quartiles derived from absolute CNA counts are associated with survival. Luminal A and B patients were stratified by PAM50 subtype and tumour grade and then tested for association with CNA burden using multiple statistical tests. Analysis revealed that patients diagnosed with luminal A grade 3 breast cancer have a CNA landscape associated with disease specific survival, suggesting that these patients could be classified as at-risk. Furthermore, luminal A grade 3 cases largely occupy a region of stratification based on gene expression at the boundary where luminal A and luminal B cases overlap. We conclude that GI reflected by absolute CNA score is a statistically robust prognostic factor for survival in luminal A grade 3 breast cancer. Therefore, luminal A grade 3 breast cancer patients in CNA burden quartiles 3 or 4 may benefit from more aggressive therapy. This demonstrates how individual genomic landscapes can facilitate personalisation of therapeutic interventions to optimise survival outcomes.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027920v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027920v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"The infection evidence of SARS-COV-2 in ocular surface: a single-center cross-sectional study","Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify whether SARS-COV-2 infected in ocular surface. 
Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a COVID-19 diagnosis, from December 30, 2019 to February 7, 2020, at Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (Rt), chest Computed Tomography (CT) were took intermittently, and SARS-COV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. 
Results: A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-COV-2 RNA fragments was found in ocular discharges by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR only in one patient with conjunctivitis.
Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, to lower the SARS-COV-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20027938v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20027938v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Public and Global Health

"Genomic variations of COVID-19 suggest multiple outbreak sources of transmission","The most important finding of this study is that COVID-19 strains form two well-supported clades (genotype I, or Type I, and Type II). Type II strains were likely evolved from Type I and are more prevalent than Type I among infected patients (68 Type II strains vs 29 Type I strains in total). Our results suggest the outbreak of type II COVID-19 likely occurred in the Huanan market, while the initial transmission of the type I virus to humans probably occurred at a different location in Wuhan. Second, by analyzing the three genomic sites distinguishing Type I and Type II strains, we found that the synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II straints are more prevalent, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control. The timely sharing of our findings would benefit the public health officials in making policies, diagnosis and treatments.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Case fatality rate of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in China","Background: A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which have caused more than 75 thousand persons infected globally is still ongoing. This study aims to calculate its case fatality rate (CFR).
Methods: The method was based on the formula of dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true CFR with time went on. According to the law, the true T value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated.
Results: CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8%. So far, the CFR and T value (T was 9) had accurately predicted the death numbers more than two weeks continuously. CFR in Hubei of China was 5% by which (and T = 5) the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number in the last week.
Conclusions: The method could be used for diseases to calculate CFR without requiring the end of pandemics. Dynamic monitor of the assumed CFRs trends could help outbreak-controller have a clear vision of the case-confirmation situation.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Epidemiology

We found two classic entities of appendicitis with natural history from non perforated appendicitis to perforated appendicitis and two entities of non-perforated appendicitis . In classic entities, one may represent majority of sporadic patients and the other may represent partial sporadic patients with obvious gastrointestinal manifestation. In entities of non-perforated appendicitis, one was identical to features of sporadic non-perforated appendicitis and the other one is identical to the following Tibetan students and associated with Fusobacterium.
The field investigation for 120 Tibetan students with appendicitis showed that the resected appendices exhibited diffuse or focal hemorrhages and infiltration by eosinophils and by lymphocytes. Most patients had normal body temperature,  white blood cell count and neutrophil count. This is a new entity of appendicitis.
The clusters/outbreaks of appendicitis showed the features of infectious disease in epidemiology. The entity of perforated appendicitis was not found.
Conclusion: Studying cluster/outbreak is a good method to differentiate different entities of appendicitis and infectious etiology.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026021v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026021v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Gastroenterology

"The landscape of lung bronchoalveolar immune cells in COVID-19 revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing","The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, etiological agent of recently named Coronavirus infected disease (COVID-19) by WHO, has caused more than 2, 000 deaths worldwide since its emergency in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, in December, 2019. The symptoms of COVID-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages, whereas notFABP4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in BALF from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of COVID-19. This study first reported the cellular atlas of lung bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment in COVID-19 patients at the single-cell resolution, and unveiled the potential immune mechanisms underlying disease progression and protection in COVID-19.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Allergy and Immunology

"Integrating genetics with newborn metabolomics in infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis","Background: Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is caused by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter smooth muscle. Building on a previously reported association between IHPS and lipid metabolism, we aimed to (1) investigate associations between IHPS and a wide array of lipid-centric targeted metabolites in newborns, and (2) address causality of the associations by integrating genetic data.
Methods: Dried blood spots were taken from 267 pairs of IHPS cases and controls matched by sex and day of birth. A mixed effects linear regression model was used to evaluate associations between Biocrates p400 Kit selected 148 metabolites and IHPS in a matched case-control design. 
Results: Seven metabolites showed significantly lower levels in IHPS cases. Levels of the top associated metabolite, phosphatidylcholine PC(38:4), were significantly correlated with levels of the remaining six metabolites (P<2.30 x 10-12). Associations were driven by case-control pairs with older age at sampling. IHPS cases had more diagnoses for neonatal difficulty in feeding at breast (P = 6.15 x 10-3). Genetic variants explaining a large proportion of variance in the levels of PC(38:4) did not associate with IHPS.
Conclusions: We detected lower levels of certain metabolites in IHPS, possibly reflecting different feeding patterns in the first days of life.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026724v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026724v1.full.pdf","2020-02-26","Pediatrics

"Perceptions of the Adult US Population regarding the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak","Background: COVID-19 outbreak is spreading globally. Although the risk of infection in the US is currently low, it is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak.

Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. Majority of the respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak.

Conclusion: Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028308v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028308v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Clinical features and sexual transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infected female patients: a descriptive study in Wuhan, China","Background:As of February 26, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 78190 people and caused 2718 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 33 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all of the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. 

Methods:From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission, we employed real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients.

Findings:The average age of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 61.5 years old (SD =11.2). Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19, and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, two female patients had sex with their partners during a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient).

Interpretation: The results from this study show no evidence of sexual transmission of SARS-CoV-2. No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas).","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028225v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028225v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices","The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries. In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028167v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028167v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Epidemiology

"Clinical Data on Hospital Environmental Hygiene Monitoring and Medical Staffs Protection during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak","Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 have placed unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene and medical staffs protection. It is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of 2019-nCoV in hospitals.
Objective: To detect the presence of the COVID-19 in the air and on the surfaces of the guide station, fever clinic, and isolation areas, and the close contacts medical staffs in the First Hospital of Jilin University.
Methods: Viruses in the air were collected by natural sedimentation and air particle sampler methods. Predetermined environmental surfaces were sampled using swabs at seven o'clock in the morning before disinfection. The samples from close contacts medical staffs were throat swab samples. Quantitative real-time PCR methods were used to confirm the existence of COVID-19 pathogens.
Results: Viruses could be detected on the surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients and in the air of the isolation ward with an intensive care patient.
Conclusion: Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during pandemic outbreaks is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control. It is of great significance to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of hospital infection control through the monitoring of environmental hygiene.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20028043v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20028043v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Public and Global Health

"Religiosity and mental wellbeing among members of majority and minority religions: findings from Understanding Society, The UK Household Longitudinal Study","Objectives: To examine the associations between religious affiliation, religious service attendance, subjective religious beliefs and mental wellbeing among the religiously unaffiliated, Christians, Muslims, and members of other minority religions in the UK using a longitudinal design. 

Methods: We used data from four waves (2009-2013) of the UK Understanding Society, a longitudinal household panel survey with over 70,000 individuals in 30,000 households which included 4,000 households from an Ethnic Minority Boost sample. We adjusted for potential confounders (including ethnicity, socioeconomic factors and personality) and accounted for household fixed effects that absorb unobserved confounding factors operating at the household level. Outcomes were the Shortened Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).

Results: Compared with Christians and the nonreligious, Muslims and members of other minority religions reported significantly lower mental wellbeing, indicated by higher SWEMWBS and lower GHQ scores. These differences were only partially accounted for by confounding factors, by ethnicity and by the mediators we examined. Amongst those with religious affiliations (Christians, Muslims, and others), higher religious service attendance was associated with higher SWEMWBS; amongst those with no religious affiliation, there was no association. Higher religious service attendance is associated with lower GHQ scores amongst those with and without religious affiliations. The subjective importance of religion was not associated with SWEMWBS yet was associated with higher GHQ scores.

Conclusions: Religious service attendance as opposed to the subjective importance of religion appears to have positive effects on mental wellbeing outcomes. This suggests that the positive effects of religion on mental health operate through social channels. Findings point to the potential benefit of secular alternatives to religious service attendance to improve population-wide mental wellbeing.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027904v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027904v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Public and Global Health

"Comorbidity and its impact on 1,590 patients with COVID-19 in China: A Nationwide Analysis","Objective: To evaluate the spectrum of comorbidities and its impact on the clinical outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Design: Retrospective case studies
Setting: 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across China
Participants: 1,590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients. Data were collected from November 21st, 2019 to January 31st, 2020.
Main outcomes and measures: Epidemiological and clinical variables (in particular, comorbidities) were extracted from medical charts. The disease severity was categorized based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoints, which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with COVID-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities.
Results: Of the 1,590 cases, the mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside Hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patients had a contact history of Wuhan city. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. 269 (16.9%), 59 (3.7%), 30 (1.9%), 130 (8.2%), 28 (1.8%), 24 (1.5%), 21 (1.3%), 18 (1.1%) and 3 (0.2%) patients reported having hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatitis B infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and immunodeficiency, respectively. 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. Patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to the composite endpoint compared with those who had a single comorbidity, and even more so as compared with those without (all P<0.05). After adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with COPD (HR 2.681, 95%CI 1.424-5.048), diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03-2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60-7.64) were more likely to reach to the composite endpoints than those without. As compared with patients without comorbidity, the HR (95%CI) was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities.
Conclusion: Comorbidities are present in around one fourth of patients with COVID-19 in China, and predispose to poorer clinical outcomes.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027664v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027664v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Respiratory Medicine

"Intranasal oxytocin enhances approach-related EEG frontal alpha asymmetry during engagement of direct eye contact","The neuropeptide oxytocin is suggested to exert a pivotal role in a variety of complex human behaviors, including interpersonal bonding, trust, and attachment. Recent theories have suggested that the role oxytocin plays in these complex social behaviors involves a modulation of motivational tendencies of approach/avoidance-related behaviors. However, to date, direct neurophysiological evidence supporting this notion is limited. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with parallel design, we assessed the effects of administered intranasal oxytocin in 40 adult men on gaze behavior and a neural marker of approach/avoidance motivational tendencies. Specifically, electroencephalography recordings were performed during the engagement of eye contact with a live model in a naturalistic two-person social context and electroencephalographic frontal alpha asymmetry, an established neurophysiological index of motivational tendencies for approach/avoidance-related behaviors, was assessed. Compared to placebo, a single dose of oxytocin (24 international units) was shown to increase relative left-sided frontal asymmetry upon direct eye contact with a live model, which is indicative of an increase in approach-related motivational tendencies toward the presented eye contact stimulus. Notably, the treatment effect was most prominently observed in participants with lower self-reported social motivation (higher Motivation subscale scores on the Social Responsiveness Scale), indicating that participants with lower social motivation benefitted the most from the administered oxytocin. No treatment-specific changes were identified in terms of gaze behavior toward the eye region of the live model. Together, these observations add neurophysiological evidence to the hypothesized role of oxytocin in modulating approach/avoidance related tendencies and suggest that inter-individual variance in person-dependent factors need to be considered in order to evaluate the potential benefit of intranasal oxytocin as a treatment. This notion is of particular relevance to the variety of neuropsychiatric populations such as autism spectrum disorder, social anxiety disorder and depression, for which intranasal oxytocin is increasingly considered a potential treatment.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028266v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028266v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19","Background A recently developing pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was originated in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread across the world. We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. 
Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital's electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. 
Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of >5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), increased C-reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%). A high level of IL-6 (>10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. 
Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Influence of a Dietary Supplement on the Gut Microbiome of Overweight Young Women","Abstract
Background: The importance of the gut microbiome cannot be overstated. Besides the help in digestion, it influences the immune system, produces immunologic and neurologic communication molecules, hormones and vitamins. The gut microbiome is also involved in controlling the BMI (Body Mass Index). 
Objectives: We attempted to influence the gut microbiome with a herbal yeast-based dietary supplement in 26 women (BASEC ID 2016-02162; ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT03223987, BS2016.1) with a BMI between 30 and 35 and and aged 25 to 35 years  within 3 weeks. The clinical trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Our hypothesis was that the supplement modifies the microbiome individually by more than 20%. 
Methods: With shotgun sequencing in the 2 stool samples of each participant we found 68 bacterial species.
Results: The microbiome was altered by more than 20%. Five bacterial species were identical to probiotic species known as good butyrate producers and described as beneficial for the gut. Seventy percent of our study cohort showed an increase in the majority of these beneficial microbes during the study. The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes is an important parameter in analyzing overweight persons. Twelve of the participants initially showed a F/B ratio (Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio) above 1.6. After three weeks, five of these women normalized.
Conclusions: A baker s yeast-based food supplement is able to modulate the gut microbiome of overweight young women within 3 weeks.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20027805v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20027805v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Gastroenterology

"Application and optimization of RT-PCR in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection","Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global threat to public health. Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. 
Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR.
Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%,68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs.
Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027755v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027755v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"A systematic review and meta-analysis considering the SSRI, SNRI and TCA classes of antidepressants and the risk for congenital heart defects","Background Antidepressant use during the first trimester is reported  in 4% to 8% of pregnancies. The use of some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) during this stage of gestation has been identified as increasing the odds for congenital heart defects, however little is known about the safety of non-SSRI antidepressants. 
Objective To assess the odds of congenital heart defects associated with the use of any antidepressant during the first trimester of pregnancy. To investigate individual classes of antidepressants: SSRIs, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and individual antidepressants.
Data sources PubMed and Embase were searched without restrictions from inception till 2 January 2020.
Study selection Prospective and retrospective cohort and case-control studies were included if they documented the maternal usage of antidepressants during the first trimester of pregnancy and assessed the presence of congenital heart defects. 
Data extraction and meta-analysis Data were extracted by two independent reviewers and the endpoint assessed was congenital heart defects.  Where studies reported multiple results for different types of heart defects or individual antidepressants, results were combined when possible. Analyses assessing individual antidepressants and classes of antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs) were undertaken.
Results A total of 16 studies were identified, encompassing 4,564,798 pregnancy outcomes. The odds ratio for maternal use of any antidepressant and the presence of congenital heart defects from the mixed-methods meta-analysis was 1.22 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11 to 1.33).
Analyses of antidepressants by class produced an odds ratio of 1.50 (95% CI: 1.19 to 1.89) for maternal SNRI use during the first trimester of pregnancy and the formation of congenital heart defects. A significant odds ratio of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.12 to 1.33) was reported for SSRIs. For the TCA class, no increased odds ratio was found.  
Analyses of individual antidepressants produced significant odds ratios of 1.53 (95% CI: 1.25 to 1.88), 1.28 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.62), 1.28 (95% CI: 1.14 to 1.45) and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.50) for paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline and bupropion respectively.
Conclusion While some insight has been gained into which classes of antidepressant and individual antidepressants pose more risk than others for causing congenital heart defects, information regarding some antidepressants is still lacking.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027532v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027532v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Epidemiology

"Illness and Fatality Risks of COVID-19 of General Public in Hubei Provinces and Other Parts of China","New coronavirus 2019-nCOV poses a big challenge for global public health in early 2020. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus rapidly spreads all over the world and takes thousands of lives in just two months. To assess illness and fatality risk of the viral infection is exceedingly helpful to ensure effective management of the general public and patients in the outbreak. Therefore, it is critical to quantify illness and fatality risk of COVID-19 for the general public. In this report, we investigate the illness and fatality risk of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5319 infected patients, 76 mortality cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our result shows a relatively low illness risk for young people but a very high fatality risk for seniors. Notably, fatality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027672v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027672v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Epidemiology

"Prevalence and clinical features of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Fever Clinic of a teaching hospital in Beijing: a single-center, retrospective study","Background With the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan, Hubei Province to other areas of the country, medical staff in Fever Clinics faced the challenge of identifying suspected cases among patients with respiratory infections manifested with fever. We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing.
Methods In this single-center, retrospective study, 342 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Fever Clinic in Peking University Third Hospital between January 21 to February 15, 2020. From these patients, 88 were reviewed by panel discussion as possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. COVID-19 was confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV in 19 cases, and by epidemiological, clinical and CT features in 2 cases (the COVID-19 Group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-COVID-19 group. Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT findings were collected, and compared between the two groups.
Findings The prevalence of COVID-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was 6.14% (21/342). Compared with the non-COVID-19 group, more patients with COVID-19 had an identified epidemiological history (90.5% versus 32.8%, P<0.001). The COVID-19 group had lower WBC [5.1910^9/L (1.47) versus 7.2110^9/L (2.94), P<0.001] and neutrophil counts [3.3910^9/L (1.48) versus 5.3810^9/L (2.85), P<0.001] in peripheral blood. However, the percentage and count of lymphocytes were not different. On lung CT scans, involvement of 4 or more lobes was more common in the COVID-19 group (45% versus 16.4%, P=0.008). 
Interpretation In the period of COVID-19 epidemic outside Hubei Province, the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia visiting to our Fever Clinic in Beijing was 6.14%. Epidemiological evidence was important for prompt case finding, and lower blood WBC and neutrophil counts may be useful for differentiation from pneumonia of other etiologies.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027763v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027763v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Respiratory Medicine

"Performance and Evaluation in Computed Tomographic Colonography Screening (PERFECTS): Protocol for a Cluster Randomised Trial","Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common, important healthcare priority and improving patient outcome relies on early diagnosis. Colonoscopy and computed tomographic colonography (CTC) are commonly-used diagnostic tests. Although colonoscopists are highly regulated and must be accredited, no analogous process exists for CTC. There are currently no universally accepted radiologist performance indicators for CTC, and lack of regulatory oversight may lead to variability in quality and lower neoplasia detection rates. This study aims to determine whether a structured educational training and feedback programme can improve radiologist interpretation accuracy. 

Methods: NHS England CTC reporting radiologists will be cluster randomised to either an intervention (one-day individualised training and assessment with feedback) or control (assessment with no training or feedback) arm. Each cluster represents radiologists reporting CTC in a single NHS site. Both the intervention and control arm will undertake four CTC assessments at baseline, 1-month (after training; intervention arm or enrolment; control arm) , 6- and 12 months to assess their detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) and 6mm+ polyps. The primary outcome will be difference in sensitivity at the 1-month test between arms. Secondary outcomes will include sensitivity at 6 and 12 months and radiologist characteristics associated with improved performance. Multilevel logistic regression will be used to analyse per-polyp and per-case sensitivity.   Local ethical and Health Research Authority approval have been obtained. 

Discussion: Lack of infrastructure to ensure that CTC radiologists can report adequately and lack of consensus regarding appropriate quality metrics may lead to variability in performance. Our provision of a structured education programme with feedback will evaluate the impact of individualised training and identify the factors related to improved radiologist performance in CTC reporting. An improvement in performance could lead to increased neoplasia detection and better patient outcome.

"Correlation Analysis Between Disease Severity and Inflammation-related Parameters in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia","Aim: The new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreaking at the end of 2019 is highly contagious. Crude mortality rate reached 49% in critical patients. Inflammation matters on disease progression. This study analyzed blood inflammation indicators among mild, severe and critical patients, helping to identify severe or critical patients early.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 100 patients were included and divided to mild, severe or critical groups. Correlation of peripheral blood inflammation-related indicators with disease criticality was analyzed. Cut-off values for critically ill patients were speculated through the ROC curve.
Results:Significantly, disease severity were associated with age (R=-0.564, P<0.001), interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) (R=-0.534, P<0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (R=-0.535, P<0.001), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (R=-0.308, P<0.001), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (R=-0.422, P<0.001), tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) (R=-0.322, P<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (R=-0.604, P<0.001), ferroprotein (R=-0.508, P<0.001), procalcitonin (R=-0.650, P<0.001), white cell counts (WBC) (R=-0.54, P<0.001), lymphocyte counts (LC) (R=-0.56, P<0.001), neutrophil count (NC) (R=-0.585, P<0.001) and eosinophil counts (EC) (R=-0.299, P=0.01).
Conclusion:With following parameters such as age >67.5 years, IL2R >793.5U/mL, CRP >30.7ng/mL, ferroprotein >2252g/L, WBC>9.5*10^9/L or NC >7.305*10^9/L, the progress of COVID-19 to critical stage should be closely observed and possibly prevented. Inflammation is closely related to severity of COVID-19, and IL-6, TNFa and IL-8 might be promising therapeutic targets.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20025643v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20025643v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"The association between cancer and spousal rate of memory decline: a negative control study to evaluate (unmeasured) social confounding of the cancer-memory relationship","Cancer diagnoses are associated with better long-term memory in older adults, possibly reflecting a range of social confounders that increase cancer risk but improve memory. We used spouse	's memory as a negative control outcome to evaluate this possible confounding, since spouses share social characteristics and environments, and individuals' cancers are unlikely to cause better memory among their spouses. We estimated the association of an individual's incident cancer diagnosis (exposure) with their own (primary outcome) and their spouse's (negative control outcome) memory decline in 3,601 couples from 1998-2014 in the Health and Retirement Study, using linear mixed-effects models. Incident cancer predicted better long-term memory for the diagnosed individual. We observed no association between an individual's cancer diagnosis and rate of spousal memory decline. This negative control study suggests that the inverse association between incident cancer and rate of memory decline is unlikely to be attributable to social/behavioral factors shared between spouses.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027516v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027516v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Neurology

"Normative vs. patient-specific brain connectivity in Deep Brain Stimulation","Brain connectivity profiles seeding from deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes have emerged as informative tools to estimate outcome variability across DBS patients. Given the limitations of acquiring and processing patient-specific diffusion-weighted imaging data, most studies have employed normative atlases of the human connectome. To date, it remains unclear whether patient-specific connectivity information would strengthen the accuracy of such analyses. Here, we compared similarities and differences between patient-specific, disease-matched and normative structural connectivity data and retrospective estimation of clinical improvement that they may generate. Data from 33 patients suffering from Parkinson Disease who underwent surgery at three different centers were retrospectively collected. Stimulation-dependent connectivity profiles seeding from active contacts were estimated using three modalities, namely either patient-specific diffusion-MRI data, disease-matched or normative group connectome data (acquired in healthy young subjects). Based on these profiles, models of optimal connectivity were constructed and used to retrospectively estimate the clinical improvement in out of sample data. All three modalities resulted in highly similar optimal connectivity profiles that could largely reproduce findings from prior research based on a novel multi-center cohort. Connectivity estimates seeding from electrodes when using either patient-specific or normative connectomes correlated significantly to primary motor cortex (R = 0.57, p = 0.001, R=0.73, p=0.001), supplementary motor area (R = 0.40, p = 0.005, R = 0.43, p = 0.003), pre-supplementary motor area (R = 0.33, p = 0.022, R = 0.33, p = 0.031), but not to more frontal regions such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (R = 0.21, p = 0.17, R = 0.18, p = 0.17). However, in a data-driven approach that estimated optimal whole-brain connectivity profiles, out-of-sample estimation of clinical improvements were made and ranged within a similar magnitude when applying either of the three modalities (R = 0.43 at p = 0.001 for patient-specific connectivity; R = 0.25, p = 0.048 for the age- and disease-matched group connectome;  R = 0.31 at p = 0.028 for healthy-/young connectome).
Conclusions: The use of patient-specific connectivity and normative connectomes lead to identical main conclusions about which brain areas are associated with clinical improvement. Still, although results were not significantly different, they hint at the fact that patient-specific connectivity may bear the potential of estimating slightly more variance when compared to group connectomes. Our findings further support the role of DBS electrode connectivity profiles as a promising method to guide surgical targeting and DBS programming.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027490v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027490v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Neurology

"It's risky to wander in September: modelling the epidemic potential of Rift Valley fever in a Sahelian setting","Estimating the epidemic potential of vector-borne diseases, along with the relative contribution of underlying mechanisms, is crucial for animal and human health worldwide. In West African Sahel, several outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) have occurred over the last decades, but uncertainty remains about the conditions necessary to trigger these outbreaks. We use the basic reproduction number (R0) as a measure of RVF epidemic potential in northern Senegal, and map its value in two distinct ecosystems, namely the Ferlo and the Senegal river delta and valley. We consider three consecutive rainy seasons (July-November 2014, 2015 and 2016) and account for several vector and animal species. Namely, we parametrize our model with estimates of Aedes vexans arabiensis, Culex poicilipes, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, cattle, sheep and goats abundances. The impact of RVF virus introduction is assessed every week, in 4367 pixels of 3,5km2. The results of our analysis indicate that September was the month with highest epidemic potential in each study area, while at-risk locations varied between seasons. We show that decreased vector densities do not highly reduce R0 and that cattle immunity has a greater impact on reducing transmission than small ruminants immunity. The host preferences of vectors and the temperature-dependent time interval between their blood meals are crucial parameters needing further biological investigations.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027821v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027821v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Epidemiology

"Association of social isolation, loneliness, and genetic risk with incidence of dementia: UK Biobank cohort study","Objective: To examine the associations of social isolation and loneliness with incident dementia by level of genetic risk.

Design: Prospective population-based cohort study.

Setting and participants: 155 074 men and women (mean age 64.1, SD 2.9 years) from the UK Biobank Study, recruited between 2006 and 2010.

Main exposures: Self-reported social isolation and loneliness, and polygenic risk score for Alzheimers disease with low (lowest quintile), intermediate (quintiles 2 to 4), and high (highest quintile) risk categories.

Main outcome: Incident all-cause dementia ascertained using electronic health records.

Results: Overall, 8.6% of participants reported that they were socially isolated and 5.5% were lonely. During a mean follow-up of 8.8 years (1.36 million person-years), 1444 (0.9% of the total sample) were diagnosed with dementia. Social isolation, but not loneliness, was associated with increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.38 to 1.90). Of the participants who were socially isolated and had high genetic risk, 4.2% (2.9% to 5.5%) were estimated to develop dementia compared with 3.1% (2.7% to 3.5%) in participants who were not socially isolated but had high genetic risk. The corresponding estimated incidence in the socially isolated and not isolated were 3.9% (3.1% to 4.6%) and 2.5% (2.2% to 2.6%) in participants with intermediate genetic risk. 

Conclusion: Socially isolated individuals are at increased risk of dementia at all levels of genetic risk.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027177v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027177v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Epidemiology

"Clinical and radiographic features of cardiac injury in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia","Objective: To investigate the correlation between clinical characteristics and cardiac injury of COVID-2019 pneumonia. 
Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) patients (including 2 deaths) of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019.
Results:Of the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 (4.88%), 32 (78.05%), 4 (9.75%) and 3 (7.32%) patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 (24.4%) patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more than normal value. 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. CT scan showed low EAT density in severe and critical patients. 
Conclusion: Our results indicated that cardiac injury of COVID-2019 was rare in light and mild patients, while common in severe and critical patients. Therefore, the monitoring of the heart functions of COVID-2019 patients and applying potential interventions for those with abnormal cardiac injury related characteristics, is vital to prevent the fatality.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027052v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027052v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Changing hand appearance using visual illusions modulates body perception disturbance and pain in longstanding Complex Regional Pain Syndrome: A randomised trial","Effective treatment of longstanding Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a challenge, as causal mechanisms remain elusive. People with CRPS frequently report distorted subjective perceptions of their affected limb. Evidence of pain reduction when the affected limb is visually altered in size, suggests that visual illusions used to target central processing could restore coherence of this disrupted limb representation. We hypothesised that using virtual reality that alters hand image to match the patients desired hand appearance, would improve body perception disturbance and pain. Also, repeated exposure would maintain any therapeutic effect. A blinded randomised controlled trial of 45 participants with refractory upper-limb CRPS and body perception disturbance (BPD) viewed a digital image of their affected hand for one minute. The image was digitally altered according to the patients description of how they desired their hand to look in the experimental group and unaltered in the control group. BPD and pain were measured pre and post-intervention. A subgroup was followed up two weeks after a course of repeated interventions. BPD (p=0.036, effect size (ES)=0.6) and pain intensity (p = 0.047, ES=0.5) reduced in 23 participants after single exposure compared to controls (n=22). At follow-up the subgroup (experimental n= 21; control n=18) showed sustained pain reduction only (p=0.037 ES=0.7), with an overall 1.2 decrease on an 11-point scale. Visually changing the CRPS hand to a desired appearance modulates BPD and pain suggesting therapeutic potential for those with refractory CRPS. Future detailed studies to optimise this therapeutic effect are required.

"Testing the association between tobacco and cannabis use and cognitive functioning: Findings from an observational and Mendelian randomization study","Background: Although studies have examined the association between tobacco and cannabis use in adolescence with subsequent cognitive functioning, study designs are usually not able to distinguish correlation from causation. 
Methods: First, separate patterns of tobacco and cannabis use were derived using longitudinal latent class analysis based on measures assessed on five occasions from ages 13 to 18 years in a large UK based population cohort (ALSPAC). Cognitive functioning measures comprised working memory, response inhibition, and emotion recognition assessed at 24 years of age. One- and two-sample Mendelian randomization, methods for testing causal inference using genetic variants as proxies for an exposure of interest, were used to examine the causal relationship between smoking initiation/lifetime cannabis use, and subsequent cognitive functioning in ALSPAC. 
Results: We found evidence of a relationship between tobacco and cannabis use and diminished cognitive functioning for each of the outcomes in the observational analyses. The clearest evidence demonstrated a dose-response relationship between tobacco use and working memory suggesting late-onset regular tobacco smokers (b=-0.29, 95%CI=-0.45 to -0.13), early-onset regular smokers (b=-0.45, 95%CI=-0.84 to -0.05), and early-onset regular cannabis users (b=-0.62, 95%CI=-0.93 to -0.31) performed worse on this task compared to individuals with a very low probability of using tobacco/cannabis. Mendelian randomization analyses were imprecise and did not provide additional support for these results. 
Conclusions: Overall, there was some evidence to suggest that adolescent tobacco and cannabis use were associated with diminished cognitive functioning. Better powered genetic studies are required to determine whether these associations are causal.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028274v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028274v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Epidemiology

"Low back pain in compensated Australian workers: a retrospective cohort study","Objectives
To describe incidence, duration, and patterns of working time loss claims in compensated Australian workers with low back pain (LBP), and compare this with other musculoskeletal conditions.

Methods
The National Dataset for Compensation-based Statistics (NDS) was used for this study. Any accepted workers' compensation time loss claims for LBP, limb fracture or limb soft tissue disease occurring between July 2010 and June 2015 were included. Demographic information, occupation, and total cumulative time loss data were extracted. Counts, rates per 10,000 covered workers, the relative risk and median duration of time loss were calculated. Multivariate Cox and quantile regression models were used to determine factors affecting time loss duration and patterns. 

Results
There were 56,102 LBP claims, 42,957 limb fracture claims, and 18,249 limb soft tissue disease claims. The relative risk of a claim for LBP was significantly greater than limb fractures after adjustment for all covariates (RR 1.30, 95%CI 1.29 - 1.32, p < 0.001). LBP claims had longer median time loss (9.39 weeks) than limb fracture claims (9.21 weeks). Quantile regression demonstrated that LBP claims were more likely than limb fracture claims to resolve within seven weeks, and to persist for periods beyond seven weeks.

Conclusions
There were differential patterns of time loss in LBP claims and limb fracture claims. The interaction between conditions, and policies and practices may contribute to these patterns. The findings should reiterate to workers' compensation stakeholders the importance of returning a worker to work as soon as practicable, to avoid future delays or challenges.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027540v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027540v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Occupational and Environmental Health

"Peripheral inflammatory response in human tuberculosis treatment is predicted by a combination of pathogen sterilization and microbiome dysbiosis","Antibiotic therapy cures infection predominantly by killing the infecting pathogen, but for infections such as tuberculosis (TB), which are accompanied by chronic inflammation, the salutary effects of antibiotic therapy may reflect a combination of pathogen killing and microbiome alteration. This question has not been examined in humans due to the difficulty in dissociating the immunologic effects of antibiotic induced pathogen clearance and microbiome alteration. We analyzed sputum TB bacterial load, microbiome composition, and peripheral blood transcriptomics from a clinical trial (NCT02684240) comparing two antimicrobial therapies for tuberculosis, only one of which was clinically effective. We confirm that standard TB therapy (HRZE) rapidly depletes Clostridia from the intestinal microbiota. The antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide (NTZ), although ineffective in reducing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacterial load in the sputum, caused profound alterations to host microbiome composition overlapping with alterations generated by HRZE. We then evaluated the effect of these two treatments on the TB driven inflammatory state and found that whereas HRZE normalized proinflammatory TB-associated gene sets, NTZ exacerbated these pathways. Using Random Forest Regression, we identify both pathogen sterilization and microbiome disruption as the top predictors of changes in TB-associated inflammatory transcriptomic markers. We then validate the observed microbiome-peripheral gene expression associations in an independent human cohort of healthy subjects in which the abundance of Clostridia was positively associated with homeostatic, and negatively associated with pro-inflammatory pathways, while the abundance of Bacilli and Proteobacteria species displayed the opposite trend. Our findings indicate that antibiotic-induced reduction in pathogen burden and changes in the microbiome are independently associated with treatment-induced changes of the inflammatory response of active TB, and more broadly indicate that response to antibiotic therapy may be a combined effect of pathogen killing and microbiome driven immunomodulation. Additionally, to our knowledge, this is the first analysis to directly test the hypothesis that the microbiome composition is associated with peripheral gene expression inflammatory profile in humans.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027870v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027870v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Spread and control of COVID-19 in China and their associations with population movement, public health emergency measures, and medical resources","ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China.

METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. 

RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; City r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; City r=0.6358, p<0.001). The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p<0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p<0.01). Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases.

CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027623v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027623v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Public and Global Health

"Polygenic risk for Alzheimer's disease predicts sleep slow-waves and daytime sleepiness in youth","A bidirectional detrimental relationship between sleep alteration and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported in cognitively normal older adults. Here, we tested whether a similar association could be detected in young adults, decades before typical AD symptom onset. We investigated associations between sleep endophenotypes and genome-wide Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) for AD in 363 young men (22.1 +/- 2.7y) devoid of sleep and cognitive disorders. AD PRS was associated with higher slow wave energy, a marker of sleep need, during habitual sleep and following sleep loss, and, potentially, with the relative increase in slow wave energy following sleep deprivation, reflecting sleep homeostasis. Furthermore high AD PRS was correlated with higher daytime sleepiness. These results imply that sleep features may be associated with AD liability in young adults and suggest that, contrary to older adults, denser and/or more intense sleep slow waves are associated with AD risk in early adulthood.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20027912v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20027912v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Neurology

"microRNA signatures of perioperative myocardial injury after elective non-cardiac surgery: prospective observational cohort study","Background: Elevated plasma/serum troponin, indicating perioperative myocardial injury (PMI), is common after non-cardiac surgery. However, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with the early appearance of circulating microRNAs, which regulate post-translational gene expression. We hypothesised that if PMI and ACS share pathophysiological mechanisms, common microRNA signatures should be evident. 
Methods: Nested case-control study of samples obtained before and after non-cardiac surgery from patients enrolled in two prospective observational studies of PMI (postoperative troponin I/T>99th centile). In cohort one, serum microRNAs were compared between patients with/without PMI, matched for age, gender and comorbidity. Real-time polymerase chain reaction quantified relative microRNA expression (cycle quantification threshold <37) before and after surgery for microRNA signatures associated with ACS, blinded to PMI. In cohort two, we analysed (EdgeR) microRNA from plasma extracellular vesicles using next-generation sequencing (Illumina HiSeq500). microRNA-messenger RNA-function pathway analysis was performed (DIANA miRPath v3.0/TopGO).
Results: MicroRNA were detectable in all 59 patients (median age:67yrs (61-75); 42% male), who had similar clinical characteristics independent of developing PMI. In cohort one, PMI was not associated with increased serum microRNA expression levels after surgery (hsa-miR-1-3p mean fold-change (FC): 3.99 (95%CI:1.95-8.19); hsa-miR-133-3p FC:5.67(95%CI:2.94-10.91); p<0.001). hsa-miR-208b-3p was more commonly detected after PMI (odd ratio (OR):10.0 (95%CI:1.9-52.6); p<0.01). Bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs from cohorts one and two identified pathways associated with adrenergic stress involving calcium dysregulation, rather than ischaemia.
Conclusions: Circulating microRNAs synonymous with cardiac ischaemia were universally elevated in patients after surgery, independent of developing myocardial injury.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027383v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027383v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Early individual and family predictors of weight trajectories from early childhood to adolescence: results from the Millennium Cohort Study","Background: Early infancy and childhood are critical periods in the establishment of lifelong weight trajectories. Parents and early family environment have a strong effect on children's health behaviors that track into adolescence, influencing lifelong risk of obesity. 
Objective: We aimed to identify developmental trajectories of body mass index (BMI) from early childhood to adolescence and to assess their early individual and family predictors.
Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the Millennium Cohort Study and included 17,166 children. Weight trajectories were estimated using growth mixture modeling based on age- and gender-specific BMI Z-scores, followed by a bias-adjusted regression analysis.  
Results: We found four BMI trajectories: Weight Loss (69%), Early Weight Gain (24%), Early Obesity (3.7%), and Late Weight Gain (3.3%). Weight trajectories were mainly settled by early adolescence. Lack of sleep and eating routines, low emotional self-regulation, child-parent conflict, and low child-parent closeness in early childhood were significantly associated with unhealthy weight trajectories, alongside poverty, low maternal education, maternal obesity, and prematurity. 
Conclusions: Unhealthy BMI trajectories were defined in early and middle-childhood, and disproportionally affected children from disadvantaged families. This study further points out that household routines, self-regulation, and child-parent relationships are possible areas for family-based obesity prevention interventions.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20027409v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20027409v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Pediatrics

"Generation of antibodies against COVID-19 virus for development of diagnostic tools","The COVID-19 China coronavirus started in Dec 2019 was challenged by the lack of accurate serological diagnostic tool for this deadly disease to quickly identify and isolate the infected patients. The generation of COVID-19-specific antibodies is essential for such tasks. Here we report that polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing animals with synthetic peptides corresponding to different areas of Nucleoprotein (N) of COVID-19. The specificities of the COVID-19 antibodies were assessed by Western Blot analysis against NPs from COVID-19, MERS and SARS. Antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry staining of the tissue sections from COVID-19 infected patient, as a potential diagnostic tool. A Sandwich ELISA kit was quickly assembled for quantitation of the virus/NP of COVID-19 concentrations in the vaccine preparations. Development of POCT is also aggressively undergoing.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025999v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025999v2.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"ADHD is more closely linked to neurodevelopmental than externalizing and internalizing disorders: A genetically informed multivariate Swedish population study","Background: While ADHD is currently classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder in the latest diagnostic manuals, the disorder shows phenotypic and genetic associations of similar magnitudes across neurodevelopmental, externalizing and internalizing disorders. This study aimed to investigate if ADHD is etiologically more closely related to neurodevelopmental than externalizing or internalizing disorder clusters after accounting for a general psychopathology factor.
Methods: Full- and maternal half-sibling pairs (N=774,416), born between 1980 and 1995, were identified from the Swedish Medical Birth and Multi-Generation Registers, and ICD-diagnoses were obtained using the Swedish National Patient Register. A higher-order confirmatory factor analytic model was performed to examine associations between ADHD and a general psychopathology factor as well as a neurodevelopmental, externalizing, and internalizing subfactor. Quantitative genetic modelling was performed to estimate the extent to which genetic, shared and non-shared environmental effects influenced the associations with ADHD.
Results: ADHD was significantly and strongly associated with all three neurodevelopmental, externalizing and internalizing factors (r=0.67-0.75). However, after controlling for a general psychopathology factor, only the association between ADHD and the neurodevelopmental-specific factor remained moderately strong (r=0.43, 95%Confidence Interval [CI]=0.42-0.45) and was almost entirely influenced by genetic effects. In contrast, the association between ADHD and the externalizing-specific factor was smaller (r=0.25, 95%CI=0.24-0.27), and largely influenced by non-shared environmental effects. There remained no internalizing-specific factor after accounting for a general factor. 
Conclusions: ADHD comorbidity is largely explained by genetically influenced general psychopathology, but the strong link between ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders is also substantially driven by unique genetic influences.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028175v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028175v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Clinical Features of COVID-19 Related Liver Damage","BACKGROUND: A recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs mainly in China, with rapidly increasing the number of cases (namely COVID-19). Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment.
METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to January 31, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. 
FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission, characterized by an increased of <U+5177><U+4F53><U+90A3><U+4E9B><U+5347><U+9AD8>alt, ast, GGT, AKP<U+7B49>. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group. There was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. Importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 may cause the liver function damage and the Lopinavir/ritonavir should be applied carefully for the treatment of COVID-19.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20026971v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20026971v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Gastroenterology

"Clinical features and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome in coronavirus disease 2019","Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19.
Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined.
Findings: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS.
Interpretation: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians.

"Social deprivation and profile of referrals and disability in paediatric chronic pain: a cross-sectional study.","Social deprivation is associated with a higher prevalence of chronic pain in children and an under-representation in specialist paediatric chronic pain programs. This study is a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of referrals to the National Paediatric Complex Pain Service in Ireland to assess if there is any link between social deprivation and pattern of referrals. Secondary objectives included determining any additional differences between deprivation categories and pain characteristics, parental pain catastrophizing, and pain-related disability, including sleep quality and school attendance. We recorded data on 289 children referred to the NPCPS between February 2016 and November 2019.  Social deprivation was assessed using the Pobal HP Deprivation Index, which is based on Irish national census data. The results of the primary analysis showed referrals have a normal distribution across the deprivation index, although the disadvantaged group had a longer duration of pain at time of first clinic review (p=0.01). Secondary analyses showed deprivation is associated with higher levels of parental pain catastrophizing (p=0.0016), most significantly for helplessness (p=0.0009), and higher use of screens at bedtime (p=0.002) with longer sleep onset latency (p=0.04). However, there were similar rates of sleep disturbance, school attendance, social interference across the deprivation groups. These findings may indicate some inequities in access or differences in service utilization for children from socially disadvantaged families. The differences in sleep hygiene and parental pain catastrophizing may indicate the need to screen for these potential mediators of treatment outcome, which may require targeted intervention when present.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027037v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027037v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Pain Medicine

"Optimal Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Dosage For Hepatocellular Carcinoma","Background and purpose: The optimal dose and fractionation scheme of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear due to different tolerated liver volumes and degrees of cirrhosis. We compared the effectiveness of stereotactic body radiation therapy dosing regimens for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
Methods and materials: This single-center retrospective study included 604 patients treated during 2011-2017. Biologically effective dose (BED10) and equivalent dose in 2 Gym fractions (EQD2) were assumed at an a/ ratio of 10. Overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free rate (LRF), intrahepatic recurrence-free rate (IRF), and progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated in univariable and propensity-score matched analyses. 
Results: Median tumor size was 5.2 cm (interquartile range [IQR], 1.1-21.0). Median follow-up was 31 months in surviving patients (IQR, 3-82). High radiotherapy dose correlated with better OS, PFS, LRF and IRF. Different post-SBRT OS, PFS, LRF and IRF rates were observed for stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SART) with BED10 =100 Gy, SBRT with EQD2 =74 Gy to BED10 <100 Gy, and stereotactic conservative radiotherapy (SCRT) with EQD2 <74 Gy. 
Conclusions: High radiotherapy dose correlated with better outcomes. If tolerated by normal tissue, we recommend SART as a first-line ablative dose or SBRT as a second-line radical dose. Otherwise, SCRT is recommended as palliative irradiation.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028621v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028621v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Oncology

"Genetic correlates of socio-economic status influence the pattern of shared heritability across mental health traits","Epidemiological studies show high comorbidity between different mental health problems, indicating that individuals with a diagnosis of one disorder are more likely to develop other mental health problems. Genetic studies reveal substantial sharing of genetic risk factors across mental health traits. However, mental health is genetically correlated with socio-economic status (SES) and it is therefore important to investigate and disentangle the genetic relationship between mental health and SES. We used summary statistics from large genome-wide association studies (average N~160,000) to estimate the genetic overlap across nine psychiatric disorders and seven substance use traits and explored the genetic influence of three different indicators of SES. Using Genomic SEM, we show significant changes in patterns of genetic correlations after partialling out SES-associated genetic variation. Our approach allows the separation of disease-specific genetic variation and genetic variation shared with SES, thereby improving our understanding of the genetic architecture of mental health.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028092v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028092v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"2019 novel coronavirus disease in hemodialysis (HD) patients: Report from one HD center in Wuhan, China","The outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan has become a global epidemic of contagious diseases, which poses a serious threat to human life and health, especially for those with underlined diseases. However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of  T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v2.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Nephrology

"Efficacy and Acceptability Comparisons of Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Drugs, and Their Combination for Panic Disorder in Adults: a Network Meta-analysis","Objective: To compare 22 oral drugs, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and their combination treatments for the acute treatment of adults with panic disorder in terms of remission rate and acceptability.
Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis
Data sources: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase databases from their inception up to May 26, 2019.
Study selection: Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of any oral drugs, CBT, CBT combined with any drug, or placebo in the acute treatment of adults with panic disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalized criteria. The primary outcomes were efficacy (remission rate) and acceptability (treatment discontinuations due to any cause). 
Results: We identified 6585 reports that included 68 full-text RCTs involving 11101 patients. In terms of efficacy, 13 (68%) of 19 interventions were associated with higher remission rates than those of for placebo, with ORs ranging from 2.1 (95% credible interval [CrI] = 1.1 to 4.0) for sertraline to 13 (CrI = 4.5 to 44) for CBT combined with any drug. Regarding acceptability, alprazolam, imipramine, and etizolam were associated with lower dropout rates, with ORs ranging from 0.23 (CrI = 0.15 to 0.33) for alprazolam to 0.076 (CrI = 0.0021 to 0.77) for etizolam. Most of the differences between the other interventions were unclear. In head-to-head analyses, CBT combined with any drug was more effective than the other interventions, but it was no associated with an improvement in acceptability (OR = 0.12 to 0.219).
Conclusions: CBT combined with any drug was more effective than the other interventions analyzed in this study. CBT alone did not differ significantly from other drugs alone. We found that most drugs are effective against panic disorder, but they exhibit different acceptability and tolerability profiles.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028605v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028605v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"Effectiveness of control strategies for Coronavirus Disease 2019: a SEIR dynamic modeling study","Background: Since its first cases occurrence in Wuhan, China, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly to other provinces and neighboring countries. A series of intervention strategies have been implemented, but didn't stop its spread.
Methods: Two mathematical models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in the city of Wuhan and in other parts of China. Special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse). 
Findings: The basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated for the period between 18 January 2020 and 16 February 2020: R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area). At the same time, Wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February 2020. The number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area) peaked around February 3. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in Wuhan occurred on February 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on February 3. Concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases. The model further shows that the COVID-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the entire country. The five cities with top risk index in China with the exclusion of Wuhan are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city.
Interpretations: Although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. As the Return-to-Work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the COVID-19 in other cities outside of Wuhan.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025387v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025387v3.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Community responses during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong: risk perception, information exposure and preventive measures","Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong.

Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected.

Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered effective (>90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07).

Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028217v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028217v1.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Estimate number of individuals infected with the 2019-novel coronavirus in South Korea due to the influx of international students from countries with virus risk: a simulation study","Background: In March 2020, overall, 37,000 international students from the country at risk of the 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection will arrive in Seoul, South Korea. Individuals from the country at risk of COVID-19 infection have been included in a home-quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain.
Methods: To estimate the possible number of infected individuals within the large influx of international students, we used a deterministic compartmental model for epidemic and perform a simulation-based search of different rates of compliance with home-quarantine.
Results: Under the home-quarantine program, the total number of the infected individuals would reach 24-53 from March 17-March 20, 50-86 from March 18-March 16, and 234-343 from March 4-March 23 with the arrival of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 1% of pre-infectious individuals, in Seoul, South Korea, respectively. Our findings indicated when incoming international students showed strict compliance with quarantine, epidemics were less likely to occur in Seoul, South Korea. 
Conclusion: To mitigate possible epidemics, additional efforts to improve the compliance of home-quarantine are warranted along with other containment policies.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023234v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023234v2.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Epidemiology

"Brain Injury after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Bicuspid Versus Tricuspid Aortic Valve Stenosis","Backgrounds: The risk of brain injury in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is currently unknown.
Methods and Results: A total of 204 consecutive severe aortic stenosis patients who underwent TAVR were enrolled. 83 (40.7%) patients were BAV patients and the other 121 patients were tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) patients. All patients received diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) at baseline, 2 to 7 days after TAVR. Mean ages (mean  SD: 75.8  6.7 years vs. 78.9  6.6 years, p = 0.004) and STS scores (6.0  3.7 vs. 7.1  4.2, p = 0.044) of the BAV and TAV patients were significantly different, while the stroke rates (2.4% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.704) were comparable between two groups. BAV patients were associated with higher number of new lesions (5.69  6.22 vs. 3.50  4.16, p = 0.008), total lesion volume [median(interquartile range): 290(70-930) mm3 vs. 140(35-480) mm3, p = 0.008], and the volume per lesion [70.0(45.0-115.0) mm3 vs. 57.5(24.5-93.0) mm3, p = 0.037] in DW-MRI. Moreover, the proportion of patients with lesions larger than 1cm3 (28.6% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.005) and the number of new lesions in the middle cerebral arteries zone (1.46  2.07 vs. 0.98  1.84, p = 0.039) and intermediate zone between the anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries (ACA/MCA) (1.07  1.68 vs. 0.50  1.05, p = 0.007), and between the vertebral artery and basilar artery (VA/BA) (1.01  1.35 vs. 0.77  1.44, p = 0.033) were higher in BAV patients than in TAV patients.
Conclusions: BAV patients may encounter more severe brain injuries not only due to greater number of lesions but also due to larger lesion size, especially in the ACA/MCA, MCA and VA/BA lesions zone.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20023184v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20023184v2.full.pdf","2020-02-27","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Does in utero HIV-exposure and the early nutritional environment influence infant development and immune outcomes? Findings from a pilot study in Pretoria, South Africa.","Background: As mother-to-child-transmission of HIV decreases, and the population of infants who are born HIV-exposed, but uninfected (HEU) continues to rise, there is growing need to understand the development and health outcomes of infants who are HEU to ensure that they have the healthiest start to life. 

Methods: In a prospective cohort pilot study at Kalafong Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa, we aimed to determine if we could recruit new mothers living with HIV on antiretrovirals (ART; n=20) and not on ART (n=20), and new mothers without HIV (n=20) through our clinics to study the effects of HEU on growth, immune- and neuro-development in infants in early life, and test the hypothesis that infants who were HEU would have poorer health outcomes compared to infants who were HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU). We also undertook exploratory analyses to investigate relationships between the early nutritional environment, food insecurity, and infant development. Infant growth, neurodevelopment (Guide for Monitoring Child Development [GMCD]) and levels of monocyte subsets (CD14, CD16, and CCR2 expression [flow cytometry]) were measured in infants at birth and 12 weeks (range 8-16 weeks).  

Results: We recruited 33 women living with HIV on ART, and 22 women living without HIV within four days of delivery from June-December 2016. 21 women living with HIV and 10 without HIV returned for a follow-up appointment at 12 weeks postpartum. The high mobility of this population presented major challenges to participant retention. Preliminary analyses revealed lower head circumference and elevated CCR2+ (% and median fluorescence intensity) on monocytes at birth among infants who were HEU compared to HUU. Maternal reports of food insecurity were associated with lower maternal nutrient intakes at 12 weeks postpartum and increased risk of stunting at birth for infants who were HEU, but not infants who were HUU. 

Conclusions: Our small feasibility pilot study suggests that HEU may adversely affect infant development, and further, infants who are HEU may be even more vulnerable to the programming effects suboptimal nutrition in utero and postnatally. This pilot and preliminary analyses have been used to inform our research questions and protocol in our ongoing, full-scale study.","/content/10.1101/19003889v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003889v3.full.pdf","2020-02-27","HIV/AIDS

"Risk assessment of novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreaks outside China","We developed a computational tool to assess the risk of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: 
(i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas;
(ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions,  and the efficacy of entry screening at destination;
(iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia and Europe, and we investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020503v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020503v2.full.pdf","2020-02-27",NA,"Boldog","/highwire/citation/72785/bibtext",1,"280220-1","28-02-2020","72785"
"CoVID-19 in Japan: What could happen in the future?","COVID-19 has been impacting on the whole world critically and constantly Since December 2019. We have independently developed a novel statistical time delay dynamic model on the basis of the distribution models from CCDC. Based only on the numbers of confirmed cases in different regions in China, the model can clearly reveal that the containment of the epidemic highly depends on early and effective isolation. We apply the model on the epidemic in Japan and conclude that there could be a rapid outbreak in Japan if no effective quarantine measures are carried out immediately.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026070v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026070v2.full.pdf","2020-02-28","Epidemiology

"Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics identify tobacco-use disparity in lung gene expression of ACE2, the receptor of 2019-nCov","In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107v3.full.pdf","2020-02-28","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Transmission potential of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) onboard the Diamond Princess Cruises Ship, 2020","An outbreak of COVID-19 developed aboard the Princess Cruises Ship during January-February 2020. Using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1-7). Our findings suggest that Rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control. Most recent estimates of Rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027649v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027649v2.full.pdf","2020-02-28","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Prevalence and clinical features of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Fever Clinic of a teaching hospital in Beijing: a single-center, retrospective study","Background With the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan, Hubei Province to other areas of the country, medical staff in Fever Clinics faced the challenge of identifying suspected cases among patients with respiratory infections manifested with fever. We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing.
Methods In this single-center, retrospective study, 342 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Fever Clinic in Peking University Third Hospital between January 21 to February 15, 2020. From these patients, 88 were reviewed by panel discussion as possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. COVID-19 was confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV in 19 cases, and by epidemiological, clinical and CT features in 2 cases (the COVID-19 Group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-COVID-19 group. Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT findings were collected, and compared between the two groups.
Findings The prevalence of COVID-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was 6.14% (21/342). Compared with the non-COVID-19 group, more patients with COVID-19 had an identified epidemiological history (90.5% versus 32.8%, P<0.001). The COVID-19 group had lower WBC [5.1910^9/L (1.47) versus 7.2110^9/L (2.94), P<0.001] and neutrophil counts [3.3910^9/L (1.48) versus 5.3810^9/L (2.85), P<0.001] in peripheral blood. However, the percentage and count of lymphocytes were not different. On lung CT scans, involvement of 4 or more lobes was more common in the COVID-19 group (45% versus 16.4%, P=0.008). 
Interpretation In the period of COVID-19 epidemic outside Hubei Province, the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia visiting to our Fever Clinic in Beijing was 6.14%. Epidemiological evidence was important for prompt case finding, and lower blood WBC and neutrophil counts may be useful for differentiation from pneumonia of other etiologies.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027763v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027763v2.full.pdf","2020-02-28","Respiratory Medicine

"Application and optimization of RT-PCR in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection","Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global threat to public health. Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. 
Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR.
Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%,68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs.
Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027755v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027755v2.full.pdf","2020-02-28","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Clinical Features of COVID-19 Related Liver Damage","BACKGROUND: A recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs mainly in China, with rapidly increasing the number of cases (namely COVID-19). Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment.
METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to January 31, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. 
FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group. There was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. Importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 may cause the liver function damage and the Lopinavir/ritonavir should be applied carefully for the treatment of COVID-19.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20026971v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20026971v2.full.pdf","2020-02-28","Gastroenterology

"Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2","Background: We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. 
Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% & 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation.
Results: Under baseline assumptions exit and entry screening combined with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by at least 83 (75% of simulations: at least 36, 97.5% 8) days while there is no more than 1 infected traveller per week. The benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by at least 76 (75%: 33, 97.5%: 7) days. With increasing rates of infected travellers, less effective sensitisation or without screening these delays shrink rapidly to a week or less.
Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination could delay outbreaks in yet unaffected countries and support local containment efforts, but only if infected traveller numbers are very low.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022426v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022426v2.full.pdf","2020-02-28","Epidemiology

"Reconciling early-outbreak estimates of the basic reproductive number and its uncertainty: framework and applications to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak","A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged as a global threat. As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number Ro -- the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of Ro vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of Ro across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate $r$, the mean generation interval $\bar G$, and the generation-interval dispersion $\kappa$.
We then apply our framework to early estimates of Ro for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early Ro estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of Ro, including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate Ro at the outset of an epidemic.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019877v4?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019877v4.full.pdf","2020-02-28","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

The study enrolled HCM patients at high risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) (n=10; age 619 y; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 609%), and three comparison groups: healthy individuals (n=10; age 286 y; LVEF>70%), ICM patients with LV hypertrophy (LVH) and known VT (n=10; age 649 y; LVEF 3115%), and ICM patients with LVH and no known VT (n=10; age 70  7y; LVEF 4616%). All participants underwent 12-lead ECG, cardiac CT or MRI, and 128-electrode body surface mapping (BioSemi ActiveTwo, Netherlands). Non-invasive voltage and activation maps were reconstructed using the open-source SCIRun (University of Utah) inverse problem-solving environment.
Results: In the epicardial basal anterior segment, HCM patients had the greatest ventricular activation dispersion [16.45.5 vs. 13.12.7 (ICM with VT) vs. 13.84.3 (ICM no VT) vs. 8.12.4 ms (Healthy); P=0.0007], the largest unipolar voltage [1094211 vs. 934189 (ICM with VT) vs. 898358 (ICM no VT) vs. 84290 V (Healthy); P=0.023], and the greatest voltage dispersion [median(interquartile range) 215(161-281) vs. 189(143-208) (ICM with VT) vs. 158(109-236) (ICM no VT) vs. 110(106-168)V (Healthy); P=0.041]. Differences were also observed in other endo-and epicardial basal and apical segments. 
Conclusion: HCM is characterized by a greater activation dispersion in basal segments, a larger voltage, and a larger voltage dispersion through LV.","/content/10.1101/19002782v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19002782v2.full.pdf","2020-02-28","Cardiovascular Medicine

"Alcohol use and cognitive functioning in young adults: improving causal inference","Background and Aims: There have been few longitudinal studies of association between alcohol use and cognitive functioning in young people. We aim to examine whether alcohol use is a causal risk factor for deficient cognitive functioning in young adults.
Design: Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between longitudinal latent class patterns of binge drinking and subsequent cognitive functioning. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) tested evidence for the causal relationship between alcohol use and cognitive functioning. 
Setting: South West England.
Participants: The observational study comprised of 3,155 adolescents and their parents (fully adjusted models) from ALSPAC. Genetic instruments for alcohol use were based on almost 1,000,000 individuals from GSCAN. Genetic instruments for the cognitive outcomes were based on 2,500 individuals from ALSPAC. 
Measurements: Binge drinking was assessed at approximately 16, 17, 18, 21, and 23 years. Cognitive functioning comprised working memory, response inhibition, and emotion recognition assessed at 24 years of age. 99-independent genome-wide significant SNPs associated with number of drinks per week was used as the genetic instrument for alcohol consumption. Potential confounders were included in the observational analyses.
Findings: Four binge drinking classes were identified: low-risk (41%), early-onset monthly (19%), adult frequent (23%), and early-onset frequent (17%). We found insufficient evidence to support an association between early-onset frequent binge drinking and cognitive functioning: working memory (b=0.09, 95%CI=-0.10 to 0.28), response inhibition (b=0.70, 95%CI=-10.55 to 11.95), and emotion recognition (b=0.01, 95%CI=-0.01 to 0.02) compared to low-risk drinkers. Two-sample MR analyses similarly provided little evidence that alcohol use is associated with deficits in working memory using the inverse variance weight (b=0.29, 95%CI=-0.42 to 0.99), response inhibition (b=-0.32, 95%CI=-1.04 to 0.39), and emotion recognition (b=0.03, 95%CI=-0.55 to 0.61).
Conclusions: Binge drinking in adolescence and early adulthood may not be causally related to working memory, response inhibition, and emotion recognition in youths.","/content/10.1101/19003327v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19003327v2.full.pdf","2020-02-28","Epidemiology

"Creatine Kinase during Non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes is Associated with Major Bleeding","Background It was recently reported that highly elevated plasma activity of the ADP-scavenging enzyme creatine kinase (CK), to >10 times the upper reference limit (URL), is independently associated with fatal or non-fatal bleeding during treatment for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR 2.6 [95% CI, 1.8 to 2.7]/log CK increase). Evidence indicates that CK attenuates ADP-dependent platelet aggregation. This study investigates whether moderately elevated CK in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) is associated with major bleeding. 
Methods The Thrombolysis In Myocardial Ischemia (TIMI) 3B trial compared rt-PA (35 to 80 mg) with placebo, and early catheterization with conservative management in patients with NSTE-ACS. Main outcomes of the current study are the independent association of peak plasma CK (CKmax) with adjudicated fatal or non-fatal major bleeding (primary), and with combined major bleeding, stroke, and all-cause mortality (secondary) in multivariable binomial logistic regression analysis, with co-variables including age, sex, BMI, SBP, creatinine, and treatment assignment. Discrimination was assessed with C-statistics.
Results The study included 1473 patients (66% men, 80% white, mean age 59 y, SE 0.3). CKmax ranged between 15 and 19045 IU/L (mean (SE), 450(24) IU/L; i.e. 2 times URL). Major bleeding occurred in 2.0% (mean age 65(1.3) y; mean CKmax 1015(318) IU/L; 6 times URL), and the combined outcome in 4.3% of the patients, adjusted OR per log CK increase respectively 3.1 [1.6 to 5.8] for major bleeding, and 3.9 [2.5 to 6.1] for the combined outcome; C-index 0.8 for both outcomes.
Discussion The presented data add to the existing evidence that proportionate to its plasma activity, the ADP-binding enzyme CK is strongly and independently associated with non-fatal and fatal major bleeding during ACS treatment. CK might increase the accuracy of prediction models for major bleeding in patients treated with antithrombotic or thrombolytic drugs for ACS.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029108v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029108v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29",NA,"Brewster","/highwire/citation/72807/bibtext",14,"010320-14","01-03-2020","72807"
"Predicting the effect of statins on cancer risk using genetic variants: a Mendelian randomization study in UK Biobank","Laboratory studies have suggested oncogenic roles of lipids, as well as anticarcinogenic effects of statins. We here assess the potential effect of statin therapy on cancer risk in Mendelian randomization analyses. We obtained genetic associations with the risk of overall and 22 site-specific cancers for 367,703 individuals in UK Biobank. In total, 75,037 individuals had a cancer event. Variants in the HMGCR gene region, which represent proxies for statin treatment, were associated with overall cancer risk (OR per 1 standard deviation increase in LDL-cholesterol 1.32, 95% CI 1.13-1.53, p=0.0003), but variants in gene regions representing alternative lipid-lowering treatment targets (PCSK9, LDLR, NPC1L1, APOC3, LPL) were not. Genetically-predicted LDL-cholesterol was not associated with overall cancer risk (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98-1.05, p=0.50). Our results predict that statins reduce cancer risk, but other lipid-lowering treatments do not. This suggests that statins reduce cancer risk through a cholesterol independent pathway.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20028902v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20028902v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Oncology

"Clinical characteristics of 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","Background
Although the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 2200 deaths in China, there was no study about death yet. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19.
Methods
For this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation. 
Results
We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26 (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28 [77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia occurred in 24 patients (70.59%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days.  One (2.78%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days.
Discussion
Lots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"A simple ecological model captures the transmission pattern of the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in China","The rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), initially reported in the city of Wuhan in China, and quickly transmitted to the entire nation and beyond, has become an international public health emergency. Estimating the final number of infection cases and the turning point (time with the fastest spreading rate) is crucial to assessing and improving the national and international control measures currently being applied. In this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when 95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February, with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March. This suggests that the current control measures in China are excellent, and more than sufficient to contain the spread of this highly infectious novel coronavirus, and that the application of such measures could be considered internationally for the global control of this outbreak.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Epidemiology

"A Generic Neural Network Approach to Infer Segmenting Classifiers for Disease-Associated Regions in Medical Image data","In many settings in digital pathology or radiology, it is of predominant importance to train classifiers that can segment disease-associated regions in medical images. While numerous deep learning approaches, most notably U-Nets, exist to learn segmentations, these approaches typically require reference segmentations as training data. As a consequence, obtaining pixel level annotations of histopathological samples has become a major bottleneck to establish segmentation learning approaches. Our contribution introduces a neural network approach to avoid the annotation bottleneck in the first place: our approach requires two-class labels such as cancer vs. healthy at the sample level only. Using these sample-labels, a meta-network is trained that infers a segmenting neural network which will segment the disease-associated region (e.g. tumor) that is present in the cancer samples, but not in the healthy samples. This process results in a network, e.g. a U-Net, that can segment tumor regions in arbitrary further samples of the same type. We establish and validate our approach in the context of digital label-free pathology, where hyperspectral infrared microscopy is used to segment and characterize the disease status of histopathological samples. Trained on a data set comprising infrared microscopic images of 100 tissue microarray spots labelled as either cancerous or cancer-free, the approach yields a U-Net that reliably identifies tumor regions or the absence of tumor in an independent test set involving 40 samples. While our present work is focused on training a U-Net for infrared microscopic images, the approach is generic in the sense that it can be adapted to other image modalities and essentially arbitrary segmenting network topologies.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028845v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028845v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Pathology

"Accurate Classification of the Gut Microbiota of Patients in Intensive Care Units During the Development of Sepsis and Septic Shock","The gut microbiota of intensive care unit (ICU) patients display extreme dysbiosis, which is associated with increased susceptibility to organ failure, sepsis and septic shock. However, this dysbiosis is hard to be characterized for each patient, owing to the highly dimensional complexity of gut microbiota. We thus tested whether the concept of enterotype can be applied to the gut microbiota of ICU patients, to describe the dysbiosis. We collected 131 fecal samples from a cohort of 64 ICU patients diagnosed with sepsis or septic shock, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to dissect their gut microbiota compositions. We find that during the development of sepsis or septic shock, as well as various medical treatments, ICU patients always contain two patterns of dysbiotic microbiota named as ICU-enterotypes, which cannot be explained by the individual host properties such as age, gender and body mass index, as well as external stressors such as infection sites and antibiotic use. ICU-enterotype I comprised predominantly Bacteroides and an unclassified genus of family Enterobacteriaceae, while ICU-enterotype II comprised predominantly Enterococcus. Among more critically ill patients with acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score > 18, samples of septic shock were more likely to present with ICU-enterotype I (p = 0.041). Additionally, ICU-enterotype I was correlated with high serum lactate level (p = 0.007). Therefore, different patterns of dysbiosis are correlated with different clinical outcomes, suggesting that the diagnosis of ICU-enterotypes as an independent clinical index is crucial. For this purpose, the microbial-based human index (MHI) classifier we proposed shows high precision and effectiveness in timely monitoring of ICU-enterotypes of an individual patient. Together, our work serves as the first step toward precision medicine for septic patients based on the gut microbiota profile.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028761v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028761v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine

"A new content-qualified antenatal care coverage indicator: development and validation of a score using national health surveys","Introduction: Good quality antenatal care (ANC) helps reduce maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Most studies that attempted to measure ANC quality proposed categorical indicators considering either contact with services or based on content, sometimes both. We aimed to create and validate a new indicator measured as a score, considering both contact and content. 
Methods: We used Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Information on ANC contact and content was used to build an adequacy score that would be applicable to all women in need of ANC. Cronbach's alpha and factor analysis were used to assess the proposed indicator. We also used a convergent validation approach, exploring the association with neonatal mortality.
Results: The proposed indicator (ANCq) is derived from the number of visits, timing of the first visit, skill level of the attendant, blood pressure measurement, tetanus toxoid vaccination and collection of blood and urine samples. The validity assessment showed satisfactory results with Cronbach's alpha coefficient equal to 0.82. ANCq score ranges from 0 to 10. The overall mean of ANCq in 63 LMICs with data was 6.7, ranging from 3.5 in Afghanistan to 9.3 in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. In most countries, higher scores of ANCq were associated with lower neonatal mortality, with pooled odds ratio of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.88-0.92).
Conclusion: ANCq allows the assessment of ANC in LMICs considering contact with services and content of care. ANCq presented good validity properties, being a useful tool for assessing ANC coverage and adequacy of care in monitoring and accountability exercises.

As of Feb 26, 2020, 1,261 cases of COVID-19 including 12 deaths were confirmed in South Korea.

"Modeling the Epidemic Dynamics and Control of COVID-19 Outbreak in China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading over China and more than 30 countries in last two months. COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including a high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed case numbers, and the effects from multiple quarantine and control measures. We develop a model SUQC to adequately characterizes the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly model the control by artificial measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models.

The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infected to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We find that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing have a reproductive number R>1, and after January 30, all regions have a reproductive number R<1, indicating the effectiveness of the quarantine and control measures in inhibiting COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan is 0.0643, significantly lower than 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) and 0.2189 of China (excluding Hubei), but increases to 0.3229 after Feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was adopted. The un-quarantined infected individuals in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is as high as 3,509 and decreases to 334 on February 21th, 2020. 

After fitting the model with recent data, we predict that the end times of COVID-19 of Wuhan and Hubei are around late-March, of China (excluding Hubei) around mid-March, and of the four tier-one cities before March 2020. A total of 80,511 individuals of the whole country are infected, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei(excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). We suggest the rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late-March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other counties in a high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan and Iran.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028639v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028639v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Epidemiology

"Infection Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) Modeled with the Integration of the Eyring Rate Process Theory and Free Volume Concept","The Eyrings rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry
and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individ-
uals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission
rate is assumed to obey the Eyring rate process theory and also controlled by how much free
volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical
reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible,
the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations
show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume frac-
tion of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier
associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are
applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak
time, peak infected, and R0. Our work provides a simple and straightforward approach to estimate
how infection diseases evolve and how many people may be infected.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028571v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028571v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Epidemiology

"Heart injury signs are associated with higher and earlier mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Importance:
Heart injury can be easily induced by viral infection such as adenovirus and enterovirus. However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated.
Objective:
To explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later.
Design, Setting, and Participants
A single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020.
Exposures: 
High levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH; a-HBDH).
Main Outcomes and Measures:
Mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days).
Results:
Of 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission (= 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was associated with higher mortality. High CK-MB was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and a-HBDH levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and a-HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and a-HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). LDH level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022).
Conclusions and Relevance:
Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028589v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028589v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Respiratory Medicine

"Changes of the Commensal Microbiome during Treatment are Associated with Clinical Response in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients","The human microbiome has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of response to anticancer therapies. However, little is known regarding changes of commensal microbes in cancer patients during radiotherapy and whether these changes are associated with response to treatment. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal cohort with sixty-two newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients who were scheduled for radiotherapy-based treatment. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected longitudinally before radiotherapy, during radiotherapy, and after radiotherapy. The nasopharyngeal microbiome was assessed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. All patients were followed up to 24 months to define an early or late clinical response. We demonstrated the beta-diversity of the nasopharyngeal microbiome showed temporal changes throughout treatment. The magnitude of changes was stably and significantly different between the early and late responders. The temporal microbial networks among NPC patients with early response differed significantly from those with late response. Seven amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) mapped to Corynebacterium were lost during treatment. Twenty-eight abundant ASVs differed by patients' responses throughout treatment. Among them, 10 ASVs differed between the early responders and late responders before getting any treatment and the difference was consistent along the radiotherapy course. This study addressed the temporal changes of the nasopharyngeal microbiome in NPC patients during radiotherapy and suggested a significant association with clinical response. The subject-specific changes of the nasopharyngeal microbiome might serve as a potential predictor for clinical response to radiotherapy.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028647v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028647v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Oncology

"Hypokalemia and Clinical Implications in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","BACKGROUND:
SARS-CoV-2 has caused a series of COVID-19 globally. SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemia
METHODS:
The patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia. 
RESULTS:
By Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. 
Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P>0.05).  Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K+ loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia.  severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K+ supplements when they were inclined to recovery. 
CONCLUSIONS:
Hypokalemia is prevailing in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal K+ loss resulting from the degradation of ACE2. The end of urine K+ loss indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker directly reflecting the end of adverse effect on RAS system.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028530v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028530v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"The Effects of ""Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan"" Makeshift Hospitals and Temperature on the Mortality of COVID-19","Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, however, the factors affecting the mortality remain unclear. Methods: A cross-sectional study based on 32 days (from January 21, 2020 to February 21, 2020) of data that were shared by China National Health Commission and China Weather Net. We compared the difference in the growth rate of confirmed cases and the mortality of confirmed cases and severe cases before and after Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan makeshift hospitals (MSHs) were put into use. We also studied whether air temperature (AT) could affect the above outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Results: Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare the difference in mortality before and after the use of makeshift hospitals. Eight day after the use of makeshift hospitals, the mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (U = 1, P < .001) and Hubei (U = 0, P < .001), while in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, the mortality of confirmed cases remained unchanged (U = 40, P = .139). However, the decrease in the mortality in non-Hubei regions also became significant until sixteen days after the use of makeshift hospitals (U = 73, P = .039). Mortality of confirmed cases was also found to be significantly correlated with temperature both in Wuhan (r = .441, P = .012) and Hubei (r = .440, P = .012) by performing Spearman analysis. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that both the use of makeshift hospitals and the rise of temperature were beneficial to the survival of COVID-19 patients. Subsequent studies are suggested to further explore other factors that may affect the mortality of COVID-19, so that this epidemic can be better contained.

"Rapid Molecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Virus RNA Using Colorimetric LAMP","The ability to detect an infectious agent in a widespread epidemic is crucial to the success of quarantine efforts in addition to sensitive and accurate screening of potential cases of infection from patients in a clinical setting. Enabling testing outside of sophisticated laboratories broadens the scope of control and surveillance efforts, but also requires robust and simple methods that can be used without expensive instrumentation. Here we report a method to identify SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT-qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection. This simple and sensitive method provides an opportunity to facilitate virus detection in the field without a requirement for complex diagnostic infrastructure.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028373v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028373v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation","Before the lock-down of Wuhan/Hubei/China, on January 23rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xian. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of resumption of work, show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10th and February 4th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027615v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027615v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Sex differences in clinical findings among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe condition","Objective: To compare the sex differences in the clinical findings among patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods: We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to 22, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and compared differences between men and women.
Results: Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62 years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7 [14.9%]). Procalcitonin level was higher in men than in women (0.08 vs. 0.04ng/ml, p=0.002). N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide increased in 16 (57.1%) men and 5 (26.3%) women (p=0.037). Five men (17.9%) had detected positive influenza A antibody, but no women. During 2-week admission, 5 (17.9%) men and 1 (5.3%) woman were reclassified into the critical type due to deterioration. Mortality was 3.6% in men and 0 in women respectively. Four (21.1%) women and one man (3.6%) recovered and discharged from hospital.
Conclusion: Sex differences may exist in COVID-19 patients of severe type.

"Highland of COVID-19 outside Hubei: epidemic characteristics, control and projections of Wenzhou, China","In late December 2019, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology in Wuhan, China. Wenzhou, as a southeast coastal city with the most cases outside Hubei Province, its policy control and epidemic projections have certain references for national and worldwide epidemic prevention and control. The maximum number of illness onset in Wenzhou appeared on January 26 (38 cases). Since January 27, the incidence per day in Wenzhou has continued to decline is likely to be due to isolation of people return to Wenzhou, implementation of region quarantine and suspension of public transportation system. Under the current control efforts, we estimate that the daily incidence by March 3-9, 2020 will drop to 0 in Wenzhou using SEIR model.

We model the transmission process on the ship with a stochastic model and estimate the basic reproduction number at 2.2 (95%CI: 2.1-2.4). Through estimating the dispersion parameter which quantifies the superspreading events, we find that stochastic bursts were unlikely to occur if the reproduction number is less than 1.

"ABC of Endometriosis Surgery: Aqua Blue Contrast Technique","Objective: Peritoneal endometriosis is the most prevalent yet least diagnosed type due to its unrecognizable nature on imaging modalities especially non-pigmented lesions would escape the surgeon's eye and experience during a diagnostic laparoscopy. We used color adjuvant by the technique called Aqua Blue Contrast Technique (ABCT) to optimize the view and to improve results.
Material methods: Patient charts who undergone surgery from 2014 to 2015 and their 5 years follow up data, along with two different control groups, have been analyzed retrospectively. As the first group the patients who had conventional surgery without the use of ABCT) were included, the second group were patients who had ABCT applied on both pelvic sidewalls but not in the cul-de-sac and as the third group the patients who had the surgery with the use of ABCT in all peritoneal cavity have been analyzed. Cases involving ovarian endometriomas and DIE were excluded.
Results: All patients have been followed up for up to 5 years. In group 1, the recurrence within the postoperative 3 years was 11.9%, and 16.1% after 5 years of surgery. The recurrence of 3 years period and 5 years period for the patients in group 2 were 8.7& and 12.1% respectively. The patients in group 3 recurred 3.2% in the 3 years period and the 4.3% recurrence rate calculated as 4.5% for the following 5 years after surgery.

"Therapeutic effects of dipyridamole on COVID-19 patients with coagulation dysfunction","The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP are needed to validate these therapeutic effects.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20027557v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20027557v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Genomic sequencing for newborn screening: Results of the NC NEXUS project","Newborn screening (NBS) was established as a public health program in the 1960s and is crucial for facilitating detection of certain medical conditions in which early intervention can prevent serious, life-threatening health problems. Genomic sequencing can potentially expand the screening for rare hereditary disorders, but many questions surround its possible use for this purpose. We examined the use of exome sequencing (ES) for NBS in the North Carolina Newborn Exome Sequencing for Universal Screening (NC NEXUS) project, comparing the yield from ES used in a screening versus a diagnostic context. We enrolled healthy newborns and children with metabolic diseases or hearing loss (106 participants total). ES confirmed the underlying diagnosis in 15 out of 17 (88%) children with metabolic disorders, and in 5 out of 28 (~18%) children with hearing loss. We discovered actionable findings in 4 participants that would not have been detected by standard NBS. A subset of parents was eligible to receive additional information for their child about childhood-onset conditions with low or no clinical actionability, clinically actionable adult-onset conditions, and carrier status for autosomal recessive conditions. We found pathogenic variants associated with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer in 2 children, a likely pathogenic variant in the gene associated with Lowe syndrome in one child, and an average of 1.8 reportable variants per child for carrier results. These results highlight the benefits and limitations of using genomic sequencing for NBS and the challenges of using such technology in future precision medicine approaches.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20024679v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20024679v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Genetic and Genomic Medicine

"Tumor-infiltrating immune cells signature predicts recurrence free survival after complete resection of localized primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors","Background: Growing evidence has proposed prognostic value of immune infiltration in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Therefore, we aimed to develop a novel immune-based prognostic classifier (IPC) to help better stratify and predict prognosis of GISTs. Methods: The gene expression profiles of 22 immune features of GISTs were detected from GEO dataset. The IPC was constructed using the LASSO Cox regression model and validated in a cohort including 54 patients with complete resection of localized primary GISTs via immunohistochemistry process. The performance assessment of the IPC was estimated, then compared with conventional risk prognostic criteria. Results: The IPC was established based on 4 features: CD8, CD8/CD3, CD68, CD163/CD68 and validated to be an independent predictor of RFS for GISTs (HR 5.2, 95%CI 1.99-13.65). Significant differences were found between low- and high-IPC group in 5-year RFS (92.6% vs 48.1%, p < 0.001). Using the IPC, the high-risk group of the Modified NIH classification was split into two groups in 5-year RFS (low-IPC vs high-IPC, 85.7% vs 30.0%, p < 0.001). The IPC showed a higher net benefit than both ""treat all"" or ""treat none"" methods for the threshold probability within a range of 0-0.62 and exhibited a performance (AUC 0.842) superior to modified NIH classification (AUC 0.763). Conclusion: The IPC was effective to predict RFS after complete resection of localized primary GISTs, adding prognostic value to the routine clinical prognostic criteria. Prospective studies are needed to further validate the analytical accuracy and practicability of the IPC in estimating prognosis of GISTs.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20025908v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20025908v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Oncology

"Evaluation of the clinical characteristics of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 during home care with isolation: A new retrospective analysis based on O2O","Summary
Background
The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 (COVID-19) has activated top-level response nationwide. We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients.
Methods
In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. 
Findings
The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(=8805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P<0.04). All inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their CT results at initial diagnosis. The body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients.
Interpretation
Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. The system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. This type of O2O, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028084v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028084v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Public and Global Health

"Prediction of the Epidemic of COVID-19 Based on Quarantined Surveillance in China","Background and Objective:
To predict the epidemic of COVID-19 based on quarantined surveillance from real world in China by modified SEIR model different from the previous simply mathematical model.
Design and Methods:
We forecasted the epidemic of COVID-19 based on current clinical and epidemiological data and built a modified SEIR model to consider both the infectivity during incubation period and the influence on the epidemic from strict quarantined measures.
Results:
The peak time of the curve for the infected newly diagnosed as COVID-19 should substantially present on Feb.5,2020(in non-Hubei areas) and Feb.19,2020(in Hubei. It is estimated that the peak of the curve of the cumulative confirmed cases will appear in non-Hubei areas on Mar.3,2020 and in Hubei province on Mar.10,2020,and the total number of the patients diagnosed as COVID-19 is 18,000 in non-Hubei areas and 78,000-96,000 in Hubei.The Chinese COVID-19 epidemic can be completely controlled in May,2020.

"Estimate the incubation period of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)","Motivation: Wuhan pneumonia is an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations.  We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable. incubation of COVID-19 along with previous statistical analysis. Our results further indicated that the incubation difference between males and females did not demonstrate a statistical significance.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027474v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027474v1.full.pdf","2020-02-29","Epidemiology

"Deep learning-based model for detecting 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography: a prospective study","Background: Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging method for diagnosing 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID19) pneumonia. Our research aimed to construct a system based on deep learning for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on high resolution CT, relieve working pressure of radiologists and contribute to the control of the epidemic.
Methods: For model development and validation, 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including 51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients of other diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China) were retrospectively collected and processed. Twenty-seven consecutive patients undergoing CT scans in Feb, 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were prospectively collected to evaluate and compare the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia with that of the model.
Findings: The model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy of 95.24%, PPV of 84.62%, and NPV of 100%; a per-image sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of 99.61% in retrospective dataset. For 27 prospective patients, the model achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist. With the assistance of the model, the reading time of radiologists was greatly decreased by 65%.
Conclusion: The deep learning model showed a comparable performance with expert radiologist, and greatly improve the efficiency of radiologists in clinical practice.

"Antibody binding to native cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B predicts vaccine efficacy","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common infectious cause of congenital disease and post-transplant complications worldwide, yet vaccine development remains hampered by a limited understanding of protective immune responses. We investigated humoral immune correlates of protection against HCMV acquisition elicited by the most efficacious HCMV vaccine tested to-date, soluble glycoprotein B (gB) with MF59 adjuvant (gB/MF59), which achieved ~50% efficacy in two phase II clinical trials. Protection against primary infection correlated with high magnitude antibody binding to gB expressed on a cell surface, but not to the vaccine antigen. Further, we identified monoclonal antibodies that differentially recognized soluble and cell-associated gB, highlighting structural differences essential for protective immunity. These results indicate the importance of the native, cell-associated gB conformation in future HCMV vaccine design.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028563v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028563v1.full.pdf","2020-03-01","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data","The COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide. We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days.  It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028431v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028431v1.full.pdf","2020-03-01",NA,"Li","/highwire/citation/72873/bibtext",3,"020320-3","02-03-2020","72873"
"Analysis on the Clinical Characteristics of 36 Cases of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in Kunming","Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming City, and to study the correlation between nutritional status and immune function.
Methods: Clinical data of 36 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in isolation area of Kunming Third People's Hospital from January 31 to February 15, 2020 were collected, and the basic situation, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. Serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB), hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp), CD3T cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cells and normal control group were analyzed. A simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between proalbumin and T cell subpopulation counts in the blood of patients. 
Results: (1) The patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming were mainly of common type. (2) 50% of the patients' first symptoms were fever and cough; (3) The total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased in 23 cases (79%), and the lymphocyte count decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), without anemia. Hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%) cases, and procalcitonin increased in 1 case. Albumin decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), proalbumin decreased in 15 cases (41.67%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), total bilirubin increased slightly in 11 cases (30.56%), and renal function and blood coagulation were normal. Absolute value of CD3+T cells is with a decrease in 21 cases (58.3%), CD4+T in 28 cases (77.8%), CD8+T in 17 cases (47.2%), and CD4+/ CD8+ inverse in 6 cases (16.7%). (4) The prealbumin, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in the new coronavirus pneumonia group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group, and the hypersensitive c-reactive protein was higher than that in the normal control group. (5) The levels of PAB in the serum of the patients were linearly correlated with hs-crp, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, and the correlation coefficients were -0.474, 0.558, 0.467 and 0.613, respectively, showing statistical differences. 
Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The nutritional status of patients with common and mild pneumonia should be considered.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029173v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029173v1.full.pdf","2020-03-01",NA,"Fu","/highwire/citation/72879/bibtext",4,"020320-4","02-03-2020","72879"
"Evaluation of Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay and Colloidal Gold- Immunochromatographic Assay Kit for Detection of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) Causing an Outbreak of Pneumonia (COVID-19)","Abstract 
BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in other countries. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited. 
METHODS: We collect two groups of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 for experiments. One group collected 63 samples for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA).
RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG). 
CONCLUSIONS: ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies are conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028787v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028787v1.full.pdf","2020-03-01",NA,"Xiang","/highwire/citation/72880/bibtext",5,"020320-5","02-03-2020","72880"
"Prediction of survival for severe Covid-19 patients with three clinical features: development of a machine learning-based prognostic model with clinical data in Wuhan","The swift spread of COVID-19 epidemic has attracted worldwide attentions since Dec., 2019. Till date, 77,041 confirmed Chinese cases have been reported by National Health Commission of P.R. China with 9,126 critical cases whose survival rate is quite low. Meanwhile, COVID-19 epidemic emergence within the other countries (e.g., Korea, Italy, Japan and Iran) is also remarkable with the increasing spread speed. It plays a more and more important role to efficiently and precisely predict the survival rate for critically ill Covid-19 patients as more fatal cases can be targeted interfered in advanced. However, the survival rates of all the present critically ill COVID -19 patients are estimated manually from over 300 laboratory and clinical features, which inevitably leads to high misdiagnose and missed-diagnose rate due to lack of experience and priori knowledge. As a remedy, we have developed a machine learning-based prognostic model that precisely predicts the survival for individual severe patients with more than 90% accuracy with clinical data collected from Tongji hospital, Wuhan. Significantly, such model only requires three key clinical features, i.e., lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) out of all 300+ features. The rationality of such mere three features may lie in that they are the representatives of tissue injury-, immunity- and inflammation-typed indices, respectively. From the COVID-19 patient diagnosis aspect, the work actualizes low-cost and prompt criticality classification and survival prediction before targeted intervening and diagnosis, especially for the triage of the large-scale explosive epidemic COVID -19 cases.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028027v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028027v1.full.pdf","2020-03-01",NA,"Yan","/highwire/citation/72881/bibtext",6,"020320-6","02-03-2020","72881"
"ZIKA VIRUS VERTICAL TRANSMISSION IN CHILDREN WITH CONFIRMED ANTENATAL EXPOSURE","Background:  In utero transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) can lead to adverse infant outcomes, but vertical transmission rates are unknown.
Methods: Antenatally ZIKV-exposed children were followed prospectively since the time of the Rio de Janeiro epidemic in 2015-16. Serum and urine specimens were collected from infants from birth throughout the first year of life. Specimens were tested by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or IgM antibody capture Zika MAC-ELISA. Infants had neurodevelopmental evaluations, brain imaging, eye examinations, and hearing assessments.
Results: Over time 130 in utero ZIKV-exposed (mothers PCR+) children were tested with 407 specimens evaluated: 161 sera were tested by PCR and IgM assays, 85 urines by PCR; 84 children (65%) were positive in at least one assay. Among 94 children tested within 3 months of age, 70% were positive (39% serum PCR, 48% urine PCR, 39% IgM). After 3 months, 33% were positive by any laboratory method. Five children were intermittently PCR+ beyond 200 days of life. Concordance between IgM and PCR results was 52%, sensitivity 65%, specificity 40% (with any positive PCR result as the gold standard); IgM and serum PCR were 61% concordant; serum and urine PCR 55%. Most children (65%) were clinically normal. Positive results were seen in 29 of 45 children (64%) with abnormal findings and 55 of 85 normal children (65%), p=0<U+0660>98. Earlier maternal trimester of infection was associated with positive infant laboratory results but not infant clinical disease (p=0<U+0660>04). 
Conclusions: ZIKV has a high in utero transmission rate. Laboratory confirmed infection is not necessarily associated with abnormal infant findings.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028399v1?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028399v1.full.pdf","2020-03-02","Pediatrics

"Psychiatric comorbid disorders of cognition: A machine learning approach using 1,159 UK Biobank participants","Background

Conceptualising comorbidity is complex and the term is used variously. Here, it is the coexistence of two or more diagnoses which might be defined as chronic and, although they may be pathologically related, they may also act independently 1. Of interest here is the comorbidity of common psychiatric disorders and impaired cognition. 

Objectives
To examine whether anxiety and/or depression are important longitudinal predictors of impaired cognition.

Methods
UK Biobank participants used at three timepoints (n= 502,664): baseline, 1st follow-up (n= 20,257) and 1st imaging study (n=40,199). Participants with no missing data were 1,159 participants aged 40 to 70 years, 41% female. Machine learning (ML) was applied and the main outcome measure of reaction time intraindividual variability (cognition) was used.

Findings
Using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, the anxiety model achieves the best performance with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.68, followed by the depression model with an AUC of 0.64. The cardiovascular and diabetes model, and the demographics model have weaker performance in predicting cognition, with an AUC of 0.60 and 0.57, respectively.

Conclusions
Outcomes suggest psychiatric disorders are more important comorbidities of long-term cognitive change than diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and demographic factors. Findings suggest that mental health disorders (anxiety and depression) may have a deleterious effect on long-term cognition and should be considered as an important comorbid disorder of cognitive decline. 

Clinical implications
Important predictive effects of poor mental health on longitudinal cognitive decline should be considered in primary care.","/content/10.1101/19006189v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/19006189v2.full.pdf","2020-03-02","Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology

"The Effects of ""Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan"" Makeshift Hospitals and Temperature on the Mortality of COVID-19","Background 
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, however, the factors affecting the mortality remain unclear.
Methods 
Thirty-two days of data that were shared by China National Health Commission and China Weather Net were collected using standard forms. The difference in the mortality of confirmed and severe cases before and after the use of Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan makeshift hospitals (MSHs) was tested using Mann-Whitney U test. We also studied whether air temperature (AT) could affect the above outcomes of COVID-19 cases by performing Spearman analysis.
Results
The mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (U = 1, P < 0.001) and Hubei (U = 0, P < 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, the mortality of confirmed cases remained unchanged (U = 40, P = 0.139). However, another eight days later, changes in the mortality in non-Hubei regions also became significant (U = 73, P = 0.039). Mortality of confirmed cases was found to be significantly correlated with temperature both in Wuhan (r = -0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r = -0.440, P = 0.012).
Conclusions
Our findings indicated that both the use of MSHs and the rise of AT were beneficial to the survival of COVID-19 cases.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028472v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028472v2.full.pdf","2020-03-02","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)

"Evaluating the impact of international airline suspensions on the early global spread of COVID-19","Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. Detailed information
on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and
prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as
effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence
of direct importation from China, and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this
model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then
incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in
delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. Finally we use the infectious disease vulnerability indices to
explain some of the estimated reporting delays.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025882v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025882v2.full.pdf","2020-03-02","Epidemiology

"Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, February 2020","Abstract
Background
The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that spread widely in China since December 2019 is now generating local transmission in multiple countries including Singapore as of February 27, 2020. This highlights the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. In Singapore, four major COVID-19 case clusters have emerged thus far. 

Methods
Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. 

Results
The effective reproduction number peaked with a mean value ~1.1 around February 2nd, 2020 and declined thereafter. As of February 27th, 2020, our most recent estimate of Rt is at 0.5 (95% CI: 0.2,0.7) while an estimate of the overall R based on cluster size distribution is at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 0.9). 

Conclusion
The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscore the significant effects of containment efforts in Singapore while at the same time suggest the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026435v3?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026435v3.full.pdf","2020-03-02","Epidemiology

"Infection Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) Modeled with the Integration of the Eyring Rate Process Theory and Free Volume Concept","The Eyrings rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry
and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individ-
uals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission
rate is assumed to obey the Eyring rate process theory and also controlled by how much free
volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical
reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible,
the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations
show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume frac-
tion of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier
associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are
applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak
time, peak infected, and R0. Our work provides a simple and straightforward approach to estimate
how infection diseases evolve and how many people may be infected.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028571v2?versioned=TRUE","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028571v2.full.pdf","2020-03-02","Epidemiology

We model the transmission process on the ship with a stochastic model and estimate the basic reproduction number at 2.2 (95%CI: 2.1-2.4). Through estimating the dispersion parameter which quantifies the superspreading events, we find that stochastic bursts were unlikely to occur if the reproduction number is less than 1. The epidemic doubling time is at 4.6 days (95%CI: 3.0-9.3), thus timely action were crucial.

"Clinical Data on Hospital Environmental Hygiene Monitoring and Medical Staff Protection during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak","Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene and medical staff protection. It is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals. 
Objective: To detect the presence of COVID-19 in the samples from the area at risk of contamination in the First Hospital of Jilin University.
Methods: Viruses in the air were collected by natural sedimentation and air particle sampler methods. Predetermined environmental surfaces were sampled using swabs at seven o'clock in the morning before disinfection. The real-time reverse-transcription PCR method was used to detect the existence of COVID-19 pathogens.
Results: Viruses could be detected on the surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients and in the air of the isolation ward with an intensive care patient.
