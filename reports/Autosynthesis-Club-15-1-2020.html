# Living systematic reviews

.larger[

An LSR is “&lt;i&gt;a systematic review that is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available&lt;/i&gt;” &lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;

Require frequent searches (e.g. monthly) to update evidence base

Possible to set-up search alerts for major evidence sources (e.g. Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar)

# _medRxiv_ Overview



.larger[
_medRxiv_ is the new preprint repository for the medical, clinical, and related health sciences.

&lt;br&gt;
First preprint registered on June 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 2019

&lt;br&gt;
Currently contains 989 preprints,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; with approximately ~50 new records uploaded each week

# Introduction to web-scraping

__Definition:__
"_The process of extracting data from a website. . .and copying it to a local database for later retrieval or analysis._" &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
__Two key stages:__
* Fetch the webpage (i.e.download a local copy)
* Extract data from it

&lt;br&gt;
__Two key tools:__
* `rvest`: an R package design to facilitate web-scraping by providing functions to achieve the steps above
* _Selector Gadget_: Goolge Chrome plugin that helps to identify the part of the page you wish to scrape

# Downloading the repository

.larger[
Two R scripts:
  1. Systematically goes through the /archive path and extracts the links to each individual preprint &lt;br&gt;
  
  1. Uses the list of links created download key information for each preprint:
    * Title 
    * Abstract
    * First author
    * Subject category (Allergy/Pain/Public Health/Epi/etc)
    * Link to bibtex citation
    * Link to PDF
    * Copy of PDF
]  
    
???
 
Program a set delay between scraps of 10 seconds

Rather than the search/ page, use the archive/, which contains all the preprints listed on _medRxiv_ in reverse chronological order.

### Expected format

The model expects the both training and testing data in a specific format:
* Unique ID
* Label 
* Alpha
* Text

The text field is created from the: Title + Abstract + Keywords

&lt;table class="table" style="font-size: 12px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Record ID &lt;/th&gt;

Here , we developed and evaluated a self-contained portable iBCI that enabled the user to interact with various computer programs . The iBCI , which weighs 1.5 kg , consists of digital headstages , a small signal processing hub , and a tablet PC . A human participant tested the portable iBCI in laboratory and home settings under an FDA Investigational Device Exemption ( NCT01894802 ) . The participant successfully completed 96 % of trials in a 2D cursor center-out task with the portable iBCI , a rate indistinguishable from that achieved with the standard laboratory iBCI . The participant also completed a variety of free-form tasks , including drawing , gaming , and typing . keyword: Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy &lt;/td&gt;

Design : A qualitative study based on a grounded theory approach was conducted through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions . Setting : Most participants lived in Gombe State , North East Nigeria . Other participants were from Ibadan ( South West ) and Abuja ( Federal capital territory ) .

Methods : This study , conducted in 2016 was part of a larger study on scale up of community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives . Qualitative data were collected from traditional and religious leaders , health workers and community members . The data were audio recorded , transcribed and analysed using a thematic framework method .

Since Gombe is largely a patriarchal society , male involvement emerged as important to the success of meaningful innovation uptake . Community leaders largely described their participation in the scale up process as active , although they also identified scope for further involvement and recognition . Conclusion : Scale up is more than setting up health sector implementing structures , training health workers and getting innovation supplies , but also requires preparedness which includes paying attention to complex contextual issues . This requires the health system and those who work in it , to move beyond a narrow health comfort zone by actively engaging with , and learning from , those who are leading , caring for and living in , the community . keyword: Health Policy &lt;/td&gt;

   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Does Smoking Cause Lower Educational Attainment and General Cognitive Ability? Triangulation of causal evidence using multiple study designs abstract: Objectives : Observational epidemiological studies have found associations between smoking and both poorer cognitive ability and lower educational attainment ; however , evaluating causality is more challenging . We used two complementary methods to attempt to ascertain whether smoking causes poorer cognitive ability and lower educational attainment . Design : A cohort study ( Study One ) and a two-sample Mendelian randomization study using publicly-available summary statistics ( Study Two ) . Setting : The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children ( ALSPAC ) , a birth-cohort study based in Bristol , United Kingdom , and general population samples from published genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) . Participants : Up to 12,004 young people in ALSPAC ( complete case analysis N = 2,107 ) ( Study One and Study Two ) , and summary statistics from three previously keyword: Epidemiology &lt;/td&gt;

   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Does Smoking Cause Lower Educational Attainment and General Cognitive Ability? Triangulation of causal evidence using multiple study designs abstract: previously published GWAS ( not individual-level data ) ( Study Two ) . Main outcome measures : Cognitive ability at age 15 ( assessed via the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence ) and educational attainment at age 16 ( assessed via school records ) ( Study One ) , and educational attainment ( measured as years in education ) and fluid intelligence from previously published GWAS ( Study Two ) . Results : In Study One , heaviness of smoking at age 15 was associated with lower cognitive ability at age 15 and lower educational attainment at age 16 . Adjustment for potential confounders and earlier cognitive ability or educational attainment attenuated findings although evidence of an association remained ( e.g. , fully adjusted cognitive ability beta -0.736 , 95 % CI -1.238 to -0.233 , P = 0.004 ; keyword: Epidemiology &lt;/td&gt;

   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Does Smoking Cause Lower Educational Attainment and General Cognitive Ability? Triangulation of causal evidence using multiple study designs abstract: ; fully adjusted educational attainment beta -1.254 , 95 % CI -1.597 to -0.911 , P &amp;lt; 0.001 ) . Comparable results were found in sensitivity analyses of multiply imputed data . In Study Two , two-sample Mendelian randomization indicated that both smoking initiation and lifetime smoking lower educational attainment and cognitive ability ( e.g. , smoking initiation to educational attainment inverse-variance weighted MR beta -0.197 , 95 % CI -0.223 , -0.171 , P = 1.78 x 10-49 ) . Educational attainment results were robust to various sensitivity analyses , while cognition analyses were less so . Conclusions : Our results provide evidence consistent with a causal effect of smoking on lower educational attainment , although were less consistent for cognitive ability . The triangulation of evidence from observational and Mendelian randomisation methods is an important strength for causal keyword: Epidemiology &lt;/td&gt;

Triangulation of causal evidence using multiple study designs abstract: Objectives : Observational epidemiological studies have found associations between smoking and both poorer cognitive ability and lower educational attainment ; however , evaluating causality is more challenging . We used two complementary methods to attempt to ascertain whether smoking causes poorer cognitive ability and lower educational attainment . Design : A cohort study ( Study One ) and a two-sample Mendelian randomization study using publicly-available summary statistics ( Study Two ) . Setting : The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children ( ALSPAC ) , a birth-cohort study based in Bristol , United Kingdom , and general population samples from published genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) . Participants : Up to 12,004 young people in ALSPAC ( complete case analysis N = 2,107 ) ( Study One and Study Two ) , and summary statistics from three previously keyword: Epidemiology &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1 &lt;/td&gt;

   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Does Smoking Cause Lower Educational Attainment and General Cognitive Ability? Triangulation of causal evidence using multiple study designs abstract: previously published GWAS ( not individual-level data ) ( Study Two ) . Main outcome measures : Cognitive ability at age 15 ( assessed via the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence ) and educational attainment at age 16 ( assessed via school records ) ( Study One ) , and educational attainment ( measured as years in education ) and fluid intelligence from previously published GWAS ( Study Two ) . Results : In Study One , heaviness of smoking at age 15 was associated with lower cognitive ability at age 15 and lower educational attainment at age 16 . Adjustment for potential confounders and earlier cognitive ability or educational attainment attenuated findings although evidence of an association remained ( e.g. , fully adjusted cognitive ability beta -0.736 , 95 % CI -1.238 to -0.233 , P = 0.004 ; keyword: Epidemiology &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1 &lt;/td&gt;

Triangulation of causal evidence using multiple study designs abstract: ; fully adjusted educational attainment beta -1.254 , 95 % CI -1.597 to -0.911 , P &amp;lt; 0.001 ) . Comparable results were found in sensitivity analyses of multiply imputed data . In Study Two , two-sample Mendelian randomization indicated that both smoking initiation and lifetime smoking lower educational attainment and cognitive ability ( e.g. , smoking initiation to educational attainment inverse-variance weighted MR beta -0.197 , 95 % CI -0.223 , -0.171 , P = 1.78 x 10-49 ) . Educational attainment results were robust to various sensitivity analyses , while cognition analyses were less so . Conclusions : Our results provide evidence consistent with a causal effect of smoking on lower educational attainment , although were less consistent for cognitive ability . The triangulation of evidence from observational and Mendelian randomisation methods is an important strength for causal keyword: Epidemiology &lt;/td&gt;

Model performance leads to large number of false positives, but small number of false negatives. 

Preferable in this case, as accept the trade off of having to screen extra false positives for reduced chance of excluding eligible record.

But 66 records marked as included all were at least someway relevant.

No additional preprocessing (e.g. convert all numbers to @)

Simplistic rule to combine chunk predictions into record predictions

Different data fields
* Formal databases have keywords (e.g. Dementia/Lipids/HDL)
* _medRxiv_ only has topic area (e.g. Epidemiology)

Only screened those included by the model - PPV only

Code was relatively straightforward, but arguably too easy to apply. Similar argument for MR-Base, that the technology makes it too easy for people to do bad MR studies.

Need better hardware - I like Google products, but Colab made me want to scream.

Same model and fine tuning parameters lead to sensitivity varying between 70% and 92%, and a similar spread for specificity.

By the time you train the model, could have screened the records - which you have to do anyway, as even the best model didn't do very well.
